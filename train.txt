-lrb- cnn -rrb- the only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound massachusetts boxing up the powdery white stuff and offering it for sale online ? people are actually buying it . for $ 89 , self-styled entrepreneur kyle waring will ship you 6 pounds of boston-area snow in an insulated styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs , he says . but not if you live in new england or surrounding states . `` we will not ship snow to any states in the northeast ! '' says waring 's website , shipsnowyo.com . `` we 're in the business of expunging snow ! '' his website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on tuesday alone , his busiest day yet . with more than 45 total inches , boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history . most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance , but waring saw an opportunity . according to boston.com , it all started a few weeks ago , when waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in manchester-by-the-sea , a coastal suburb north of boston . he joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states , and an idea was born . his business slogan : `` our nightmare is your dream ! '' at first , shipsnowyo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $ 19.99 , but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination . so this week , waring began shipping larger amounts in the styrofoam cubes , which he promises will arrive anywhere in the u.s. in less than 20 hours . he also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $ 119 . many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag , he said . whether waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen . but he has no shortage of product . `` at this rate , it 's going to be july until the snow melts , '' he told boston.com . `` but i 've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items . maybe i 'll ship some fall foliage .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the 6th of april 1996 , san jose clash and dc united strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the spartan stadium in san jose , california . the historic occasion was the first ever major league soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world 's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer . summarizing the action for espn , commentator ty keough eagerly described the momentous `` birth of a new era for american soccer . '' looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it 's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia . baggy shirts , questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative mls experience . countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half . even more bizarrely , tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper . as the mls prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season , it 's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period . long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start . attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015 . a further four are set to be added by 2020 . on top of this , the new season is the first of a new domestic tv and media rights deal with fox , espn and univision worth $ 700 million over eight years . this figure may pale beside the $ 5.1 billion recently paid by uk broadcasters for the english premier league , the richest football league in the world , but it represents a tripling in value of the previous mls deal . according to phil rawlins , co-primary owner and president of the new mls franchise , orlando city soccer club , `` the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically '' in the u.s. . he believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the mls . rawlins ' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation . he describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago . this weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness orlando city 's opening weekend fixture against new york city , another new club making their mls bow . world cup winners kaka and david villa will turn out for orlando and new york city respectively . `` we 're just on the crest of the wave at the moment , '' rawlins said of football 's american progress . `` can it be the number two , number three sport in this country ? yes , i think it can . and it can be in a short space of time . '' these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest u.s. fans showed in last year 's world cup in brazil . team usa 's group stage clash with portugal attracted 25 million viewers , according to figures from tv ratings firm , nielsen . that 's considerably more than the 15 million baseball 's 2013 world series averaged on fox or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 nba finals on abc . anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out chicago 's grant park to cheer on their country via big screens , meanwhile , would find it hard to argue against soccer in the u.s. now being anything other than a big deal . reaching this promising stage , however , has been anything but a smooth ride . the mls was reported to have lost as much as $ 250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season . three teams -- miami fusion , tampa bay mutiny -lrb- both in 2001 -rrb- and chivas usa -lrb- 2014 -rrb- -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles . a report by forbes at the end of 2013 , meanwhile , claimed that only 10 out of 19 mls teams were profitable . and as recently as this week , mls players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end . then there 's the way the league develops , attracts and trades players . a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads . each side , however , has a number of spaces that can be allocated to `` off budget '' signings which are not included within the cap . this includes promising generation adidas players who enter the mls through the draft systems before completing their college education . homegrown players from club 's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players -lrb- dps -rrb- , usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors . one of the main criticisms of the mls and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like david beckham , freddie ljungberg and thierry henry to appear in the mls , it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory . why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time , after all ? and herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see . although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity , it means mls teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not . head coach of sporting kansas , peter vermes , highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the kansas city star newspaper last year . `` we 're in a place where at times you ca n't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances . we have a salary cap . they do n't , '' vermes said . according to paulo teixeira , a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years , current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the mls grow yet further . he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with european passports . such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the mls to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the atlantic . theoretically , at least , this money can then be reinvested in the league , player development and attracting yet more promising players to the mls . this in turn will raise the standard further . an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of oriol rossell , a spanish midfielder who moved from sporting kansas to sporting lisbon last year in a deal brokered by teixeira . rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by fc barcelona in 2012 . he excelled at kansas , winning the mls cup before being sold to the portuguese giants at a profit in june 2014 . teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish . it could also be achieved by signing dps closer to the peak stage of their career , he added . this last point is something that appears be happening already . `` before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in europe , '' teixeira said . '' -lrb- but -rrb- villa is not an old guy , -lrb- frank -rrb- lampard is still going strong '' and both could still offer something to teams in europe , he said by way of example of new york city 's first dp signings . nevertheless , he continued , the signing of more young players with big potential `` is probably something we 'll see more of . '' whether teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead . either way , that brave new mls dawn that broke over san jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning . cnn 's don riddell contributed to this story .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- french striker bafetimbi gomis , who has a history of fainting , said he is now `` feeling well '' after collapsing during swansea 's 3-2 loss at tottenham in the premier league on wednesday . the worrying incident occurred in the first half at white hart lane -- after tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment . the guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask . play was temporarily stopped before resuming . as the match progressed , swansea tweeted that gomis was `` fine , '' with manager garry monk using the same word to describe gomis ' condition . gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution , swansea said on its website . `` i wanted to reassure you concerning my health , '' gomis told the website . `` it actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous , and i am feeling well now . `` i have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father 's health , which requires me to go back and forth from france . `` i was disappointed that i could n't help my team tonight , but now everything is back in order . i also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages . '' gomis had similar fainting spells in france , which prompted the president of his former club , jean-michel aulas of lyon , to tell french television in 2009 : `` we ca n't not be worried , it scares you each time . '' swansea ran tests on gomis , said monk , prior to signing him on a free transfer last july . `` he just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems , '' monk said in a televised interview on sky . `` it 's been part of his life . we were well aware of that when we signed him . he 's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it 's just part of his life . `` it 's no problems whatsoever . it 's not as serious as it looks . '' gomis has scored two league goals for swansea this season , mostly in a backup role . he became the welsh side 's top striker when wilfried bony signed with manchester city in january . almost exactly three years ago at white hart lane , then bolton midfielder fabrice muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest . he was near death , according to bolton , but survived after being treated at the london chest hospital . he subsequently retired . other footballers , including cameroon international marc-vivien foe in 2003 and spanish international antonio puerta in 2007 , did n't survive after collapsing on the pitch .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- my vote for father of the year goes to curt schilling . the former major league baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about schilling 's teenage daughter . the drama started , innocently enough , on february 25 , when schilling played the role of a proud father . he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter , gabby , on being accepted to salve regina university , where she 'll play softball . it read : `` congrats to gabby schilling who will pitch for the salve regina seahawks next year !! -- curt schilling -lrb- @gehrig38 -rrb- '' almost immediately , responses came in from young men , complete strangers who apparently followed schilling on twitter . the tweets quickly went from immature , to creepy , to repugnant . threats of rape were common . the tweets were deleted , and the accounts were closed after this story went viral . but not before schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog . what was said about 17-year-old gabby schilling was n't just obnoxious . it was vile and obscene . what was said was n't just mean and ugly . it was threatening and scary . as a parent , it 's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions . these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity , the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites , where you feel free to be a despicable human being because , you think , no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words . if so , they thought wrong . they could n't hide . they were found out , and they got the throttling they so richly deserved . thanks to dad . according to schilling , who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are , two people have already paid a price due to their tweets . one was a student disc jockey at a community college in new jersey , who was suspended , and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the new york yankees , who was fired . concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide , schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved . bravo for him . i 'm sure that , all across america , dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at schilling 's self-control . i have two daughters of my own , and he 's a better man than me . if ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap , this is it . so what additional insights can we draw , and what larger lessons can we learn , from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media ? there are a few . the first is about accountability , the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid . but schilling would n't let them . at their best , social media sites like twitter , facebook , instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community . at their worst , they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences . we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability . there 's also something to be said about protective parents , and how essential they are to a working society . we should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews . we should n't bubblewrap our kids , and keep them from playing outdoors , and then sit around wondering why they 're soft , timid , and risk-averse . but protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style . a parent 's top job is to protect his children . schilling did his job . finally , it 's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules , standards , and expectations that should guide your behavior . there are things you do n't say . there are boundaries , ways that we expect you to behave so you do n't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself , your friends , and your family . if you do n't have social skills , you do n't belong on social media . the tweets make you wince . but in this story , you 'll still find plenty to smile about . this whole drama unfolded because schilling was proud of his daughter . now , given how he reacted , we all have reason to be proud of him .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf 's fictional anti-hero happy gilmore than the world 's reigning no 1 . player . but when rory mcilroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the wgc cadillac championship into a lake friday , he might as well have been channeling the much loved adam sandler character . before continuing his round with a dropped ball , the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well . '' -lrb- it -rrb- felt good at the time , '' a rueful mcilroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the pga tour website . `` i just let frustration get the better of me . it was heat of the moment , and i mean , if it had of been any other club i probably would n't have but i did n't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so i thought , why not . '' the club `` must have went a good 60 , 70 yards , '' he joked . mcilroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70 , leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader jb holmes . while an improvement on last weeks performance at the honda classic event , where he failed to make the cut , the northern irishman 's frustration with elements of his game was still clear . `` i think every golfer feels it because i do n't hit shots like the one i hit on 8 on the range , '' he said . `` that 's what really bothers me , the fact that i get out on the course and i hit shots that i 'm not seeing when i 'm in a more relaxed environment . `` so it 's a little bit of mental , a little bit of physical . it 's just everything is not quite matching up . '' elsewhere on the course , ryan holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall , two shots behind holmes . former world no 1. , adam scott carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while bubba watson and henrik stenson are tied for fourth on four-under .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- former vice president walter mondale was released from the mayo clinic on saturday after being admitted with influenza , hospital spokeswoman kelley luckstein said . `` he 's doing well . we treated him for flu and cold symptoms and he was released today , '' she said . mondale , 87 , was diagnosed after he went to the hospital for a routine checkup following a fever , former president jimmy carter said friday . `` he is in the bed right this moment , but looking forward to come back home , '' carter said during a speech at a nobel peace prize forum in minneapolis . `` he said tell everybody he is doing well . '' mondale underwent treatment at the mayo clinic in rochester , minnesota . the 42nd vice president served under carter between 1977 and 1981 , and later ran for president , but lost to ronald reagan . but not before he made history by naming a woman , u.s. rep. geraldine a. ferraro of new york , as his running mate . before that , the former lawyer was a u.s. senator from minnesota . his wife , joan mondale , died last year .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- share , and your gift will be multiplied . that may sound like an esoteric adage , but when zully broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger , her generosity paired up with big data . it resulted in six patients receiving transplants . that surprised and wowed her . `` i thought i was going to help this one person who i do n't know , but the fact that so many people can have a life extension , that 's pretty big , '' broussard told cnn affiliate kgo . she may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power . `` thanks for all the support and prayers , '' a comment on a facebook page in her name read . `` i know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us . i also know i 'm just the messenger . '' cnn can not verify the authenticity of the page . but the power that multiplied broussard 's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs . it works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level , according to california pacific medical center in san francisco . so high , that it is taking five surgeons , a covey of physician assistants , nurses and anesthesiologists , and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people . they are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients . `` the ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs , one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair , '' the medical center said in a statement . the chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up friday . in late march , the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients . here 's how the super swap works , according to california pacific medical center . say , your brother needs a kidney to save his life , or at least get off of dialysis , and you 're willing to give him one of yours . but then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him , and it 's certain his body would reject it . your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died . maybe that will work out -- or not , and time could run out for him . alternatively , you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say , two more siblings , where the donor 's kidney is n't suited for his sister , the recipient . but maybe your kidney is a match for his sister , and his kidney is a match for your brother . so , you 'd do a swap . that 's called a paired donation . it 's a bit of a surgical square dance , where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling . but instead of a square dance , broussard 's generous move set off a chain reaction , like dominoes falling . her kidney , which was removed thursday , went to a recipient , who was paired with a donor . that donor 's kidney went to the next recipient , who was also paired with a donor , and so on . on friday , the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain . such long-chain transplanting is rare . it 's been done before , california pacific medical center said in a statement , but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time . that changed when a computer programmer named david jacobs received a kidney transplant . he had been waiting on a deceased donor list , when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger . jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills , creating matchgrid , a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly . `` when we did a five-way swap a few years ago , which was one of the largest , it took about three to four months . we did this in about three weeks , '' jacobs said . but this chain would n't have worked so quickly without broussard 's generosity -- or may not have worked at all . `` the significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients , '' said dr. steven katznelson . `` where there had been only three or four options , with the inclusion of the altruistic donor , we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients . '' and that 's divine , broussard 's friend shirley williams wrote in a comment her on broussard 's facebook page . `` you are a true angel my friend . ''
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- a photo of a weasel hitching a surprise lift on the back of a flying woodpecker near london has gone viral on twitter , with more than 7,000 users retweeting the original post of the image . it was first posted by photographer jason ward on monday and credited to martin le-may . after #weaselpecker gained momentum , british media soon picked up the story , and television channel itv interviewed le-may . the amateur photographer from essex , near london , told the broadcaster he had been walking with his wife in hornchurch country park , essex , when they heard `` a distressed squawking '' noise and spotted the woodpecker . `` just after i switched from my binoculars to my camera the bird flew across us and slightly in our direction ; suddenly it was obvious it had a small mammal on its back and this was a struggle for life , '' le-may said . eventually , le-may told itv , the weasel -- known as a `` least weasel '' in some countries -- lost its grip and the bird flew away . marina pacheco , chief executive of britain 's mammal society told cnn the image looked genuine and that it was possible an omnivorous weasel would take on a woodpecker . `` weasels will go for anything that looks like food -- they 've got a high metabolism and they 've got to eat a lot , '' she said . `` it does n't surprise me that a weasel took a punt -- i 've seen a photo of a weasel charging a group of sparrows , they 're very hungry animals . '' but she said the weasel , which would generally try to break the neck of its prey to subdue it , may have exceeded its abilities in this case . `` i think it was a bit of a long shot -- it looks like it tried to grab the neck of the woodpecker to break it , '' pacheco said . `` i think that it probably does n't have a big enough jaw to bite through the spine of the woodpecker . '' weasels would not normally target green woodpeckers , pacheco said -- their predators are normally the size of a stoat or larger . but the birds are known to spend a fair amount of time on the ground pulling up worms and hunting insects . `` if the woodpecker had managed to hit the weasel with its beak it would have been the end of the weasel , '' she said . `` they 're quite gung-ho little creatures . '' the pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on twitter , with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by russian president vladimir putin , popstar miley cyrus , football star john terry -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a darth vader costume . -lrb- update : twitter has now educated us on the difference between a dog and a red panda . sorry , darth ! -rrb- . as for the bird ? the green woodpecker is also known as a `` yaffle '' for its laughing call . after the shock of being targeted by a hungry weasel wears off , we can only hope it lives up to its nickname .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a pennsylvania community is pulling together to search for an eighth-grade student who has been missing since wednesday . the search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online . the parents of cayman naib , 13 , have been communicating through the facebook group `` find cayman '' since a day after his disappearance , according to close friend david binswanger . newtown police say cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket , black ski pants and hiking boots . he could be in the radnor-wayne area , roughly 20 miles from philadelphia , or may have purchased a train ticket to philadelphia , according to an alert posted on facebook . `` we think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act , '' farid naib , cayman 's father , wrote thursday on the group page . `` we have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is . cayman does have his phone , we do n't know if he has any cash , he does not have his wallet .

'' `` mali remains committed to seeking peace and will not be intimidated by those who have no other motives than to do away -lrb- with -rrb- the prospects of peace and harmony amongst the malians , '' the government said in a statement . a north african jihadist group , al-murabitun , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to mauritanian news agency al akhbar . the purported claim came in an audio message in which the group said it carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of one of its leaders , al akhbar said . `` al-murabitun may be considered a regional competitor to al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , '' according to the jamestown foundation , a washington-based research and analysis firm . the u.s. state department said in january that al-murabitun is a `` newly-formed '' militant group that has presence in northern mali . french foreign minister laurent fabius said the victim from his country was 31 years old . french president francois hollande released a statement condemning the attack . u.s. secretary of state john kerry expressed his condolences to the victims ' families in a news conference in paris on saturday . `` this is an act of cowardice , '' he said . `` but an act of opening fire in a restaurant filled with innocent civilians -- in the end , that only strengthens our resolve to fight terrorism in all of its forms , wherever it exists .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- farah fled the civil war in syria with her husband in the middle of the night , hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into jordan . two days later , she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status . like 70,000 other refugees from syria , iraq , sudan and the palestinian territories , farah -lrb- her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity -rrb- now lives with her family in zarqa , a poor jordanian city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks . men dominate public spaces , and many women stay at home , isolated . two years ago , farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer . here , he found work tiling construction sites , but was arrested three times for working illegally . `` now my husband stays at home , depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps , '' farah said . she is now the family breadwinner , working at a local organization providing educational programs to syrian and jordanian children . every day she navigates the dangers of zarqa 's crime-ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men . yet zarqa is also a pocket of hope . some 384 female refugees working with the near east foundation have been able to re-establish savings , restore dignity , strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives . many of them choose to become earners for the first time . they belong to a network of jordanian and refugee women -- coaches , mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support , exchange tips and build friendships . some 80 % of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home-based business . fatiya , who escaped iraq during the 2003 invasion , was surviving on charity until six months ago . now she runs her own leather goods home-based business , making belts , wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home . these days , fatiya is busy rebuilding her life . `` i make my own way , `` she says . zainab , also an iraqi refugee , is now a hairdresser in zarqa . on the side , she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women , walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent . on march 8 , we celebrate international women 's day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who , like farah , fatiya and zainab , continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination , creativity and skill , despite increasingly limited options . aid agencies must match the strength of these women 's resilience . to truly assist them , we must empower them with opportunities and choices . of the 10.5 million refugees registered with unhcr , the un 's refugee agency , less than 1 % are eventually resettled . the rest remain in limbo , forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work . refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years , and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over . humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on `` immediate '' aid -- distribution of cash , food and subsistence items . this is unsustainable . unhcr provides critical cash assistance to refugees in jordan -- but this can be as little as $ 71 a month , 16 times below the country 's poverty line . refugees need to supplement their allowances , yet they can not legally find employment , and working in the informal sector can be dangerous . farah , fatiya and zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy . but their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms , exposing them to heightened abuse and violence . women 's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence . to help this network of women control the income they earn , the near east foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives ' and daughters ' newfound roles . `` in the beginning , these women were tremendously shy -- they did n't talk , '' says hamdan eliemat , who heads the bani hasan islamic society , a community organization supporting the women . he laughs . `` and now they wo n't stop talking . and we men , now we have to listen . '' the international community must advocate for refugees ' right to survive . we must ensure that beyond immediate aid , women have access to skill-building , financial resources , social networks and protection from violence and harassment , so they have the chance to build their own futures .

'' a kent county , delaware , family court commissioner ruled in february that busch must stay away from driscoll for a year . nascar officials decided to lift busch 's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit 's reinstatement program , completed behavioral assessments and got the ok from a behavioral health care expert to race again . he 's not totally out of the woods . in a news release , nascar said busch must `` undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized .

'' the captain said he was unable to stop the aircraft from drifting left , according to the report . the boeing md-88 sustained significant damage to the left wing , flight spoilers , the nose of the plane and the left wing fuel tank , according to the ntsb . delta flight 1086 departed from atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. thursday . laguardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later . the aircraft briefly circled new york because of issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. . the plane slid off the runway with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters . twenty three passengers received minor injuries , and others were transported to the hospital for evaluation . an ntsb meteorologist is examining the weather conditions at the time of the accident , said the report . the cause of the accident has not been determined .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- when i was a child , a pale specter used to call our house most evenings , eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns . we called her the `` white bread lady , '' a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread . she was n't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread . no , she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision . although we all laughed at the time , it was with a bit of shifty-eyed shame . because most of us -lrb- including if not particularly the illustrious ehrlich family -rrb- have lurking within us our very own `` white bread lady , '' ready to convince us that each cough , sniffle and less-than-nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health . and , naturally , that white bread lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information . yup , so quoth google , we all have cancer . according to the pew research center , 80 % of internet users have looked up health information online . while that practice can be beneficial in some respects , the abundance of -lrb- variably valid -rrb- information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs . -lrb- or , worse , can lead us to neglect getting the care we need . -rrb- . read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online . searching blind . your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall , twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair . you type `` eye twitch '' into google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open , revealing to you wonders untold . you are the chosen one . too bad that this trove of `` medical information '' is actually some dude 's fan-fiction site . sure , the above is an extreme example , but , as dr. kevin pho of kevinmd.com pointed out , `` there 's a lot of bad information on the web and information that can be dangerous . '' especially if you 're not considering who put up that information in the first place . pho urges users to favor web addresses ending in . org and . edu when looking for reputable health-care info , and to check who is funding the collection of that information . `` there 's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the web , '' he said . he suggests turning to sites like mayo clinic as well as troves of information curated by doctors -lrb- like pho 's own website -rrb- when trolling the web for info . and , of course , if a site mentions trolls and third eyes , one should definitely press on . flailing in forums . if there 's one thing people like to do online , it 's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies ' various and sundry discharges . that 's all well and good ; sharing experiences with others is enriching ! unless the people you 're sharing with are idiots . `` you can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really is n't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close , '' warned craig monsen , co-founder of symptom-checker app symcat . on the other hand , `` sometimes you 'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem , and their solution does help . '' `` health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms , '' added dr. natasha burgert of kc kids doc . `` i think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community . '' the trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you . and , you know , if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach , maybe click off and see a doc . getting emotional . you know that game `` 6 degrees of kevin bacon '' ? there should seriously be a version of that called `` 6 degrees of cancer '' -- as in , when looking up your symptoms online , how long does it take to deduce that you have a life-threatening disease instead of , say , a simple cold ? according to burgert , the root of this whole `` worst-case scenario '' thing is getting too emotional . `` for most intents and purposes , when you 're looking for online health information , it 's about yourself or a family member , '' she said . `` when you 're looking through that lens , it 's very hard to keep emotional distance . so you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that 's the path you 'll continue down , whether it 's correct or not . '' burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to `` understand possible diagnoses , find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home . '' symcat and mayo clinic 's symptom checker let you type in what you 're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor 's aid . your doctor 's website might also have such a tool . voila , you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees . keeping mum around mds . `` i think , traditionally , many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the internet , '' pho said . `` but i think more and more doctors are accepting it . personally , i think that transparency of information is helpful in a way . '' translation : help your doctor help you . if you 're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what 's ailing you , share that info with your physician . `` i really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online , because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns , '' burgert said . `` people get scared when they get sick and hurt , and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves . the internet adds to that physician 's expertise in order to do that . '' remember , though , knowing how to use the internet does n't make you a doctor . google does n't count as a second opinion . if you 're unhappy with your doc 's diagnosis , go get one the traditional way . putting off the inevitable . if your ailment is n't going away , all the symptom-checking and mayo clinic-ing in the world is n't going to help you . make a doctor 's appointment . like , right now . sites like zocdoc make it super easy -lrb- and free ; doctors pay to be listed -rrb- to set up an appointment asap , so no whining that you 'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then `` it '' will have gone away . unless , of course , `` it '' is that white bread you just ate . in that case , please stop calling my dad .

kuala lumpur -lrb- cnn -rrb- the initial hours after the disappearance of flight mh370 were characterized by confusion and chaos , as air traffic controllers struggled to comprehend the situation and radar operators failed to take notice , according to data contained in an interim report . the report -- released one year after the disappearance of the boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew -- provides a detailed picture of delays and protocol violations before the launch of the search and rescue . an astonishing five hours and 13 minutes passed between the last communication from the flight crew and kuala lumpur 's first distress signal concerning the missing plane . and it was another five hours before the first search flights took off to try to find it . cnn 's aviation correspondent richard quest said he believes the delayed response was the most disturbing thing revealed by the interim report -- `` the lack of somebody pushing the big red button that says crisis and panic . '' a year later after the plane 's disappearance , not a single trace of flight mh370 has been found despite extensive search efforts . investigators believe the wreckage lies somewhere on the bottom of the indian ocean , based on the analysis of satellite communications data . the first sign that something was wrong with flight mh370 came after plane failed to check in with vietnamese air traffic controllers after leaving malaysian airspace . according to protocol , ho chi minh atc should have informed their kuala lumpur counterparts -lrb- kl atcc -rrb- about this within five minutes . instead they waited 20 . when ho chi minh finally did inform kuala lumpur , the confusion was evident , as seen in transcripts of the conversation released sunday . kl atcc asked three times at what point ho chi minh lost contact , then went on to express concern at the delay , asking `` why you did n't tell me first ? within five minutes you should be -lrb- sic -rrb- called me . '' the confusion only got worse after malaysia airlines mistakenly told kuala lumpur air traffic controllers they could see the flight somewhere over cambodia . it took an hour and a half to clear this up , after malaysia airlines admitted to controllers they were only looking at the projected flight track . malaysia airlines ceo ahmad jauhari yahya said the misinformation was a momentary lapse by a company employee . `` our information was only to be as a guide . we are not an atc per se . we do n't have radar , '' he told cnn . the watch supervisor then waited another two hours to activate the rescue coordination center . still another hour went by before before kuala lumpur issued the distress signal . no explanation for the delay is given in the interim report , which is composed of factual data and provides no conclusions or recommendations . after the air traffic controllers lost contact with mh370 , the plane continued to fly within the range of multiple radar systems belonging to four different countries . yet little seems to have been done with the data in the immediate hours after the plane disappeared . the interim report says that `` for unknown reasons '' indonesia 's medan radar did not see the flight . and thailand `` did not pay much attention , '' since mh370 's flight path did not fall within its borders . malaysian military radar tracked the flight for an additional hour , including its turn back across the malay peninsula . despite this information , search and rescue teams did not begin expanding the search area for a full day . though the interim report makes no mention of it , a failure by the malaysian military to alert others to the relevant radar data may be blame . a briefing document prepared by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- said military authorities failed to share the final radar fix of mh370 with their civilian counterparts for 20 hours . cnn approached malaysia 's ministry of defence for comment but is yet to receive a response . another working document notes that mh370 's turn back might have been discovered much earlier , if the military and non-military agencies had coordinated better . `` in essence , a week or more was lost in the initial search because of poor civil/military cooperation , '' reads the icao working document . the interim report released by malaysian investigators on sunday provides no information about when the military radar data was shared with other authorities . it 's impossible to know if a speedier response from air traffic controllers , or more immediate access to radar data , would have changed the course of events for mh370 . but it would have provided authorities with more time , either to track the flight or to search the ocean before the batteries died in the emergency locator beacons . looking back at the series of miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the radar lapses also provides valuable lessons that could help future search and rescue operations . though the mh370 investigation team did not draw lessons in the current report , it plans to provide safety recommendations in the months ahead . journalist chan kok leong contributed to this report .

new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- the north korean ambassador in bangladesh issued an apology after one of the embassy 's diplomats was caught carrying 27 kilograms -lrb- 59 pounds -rrb- of undeclared gold into the country 's main airport in dhaka , according to officials in bangladesh . north korean officials could not be reached for comment . meanwhile , state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident . kazi muhammad ziauddin , a top official in bangladesh 's customs agency , told cnn his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of march 5th , after the diplomat arrived on a singapore airlines flight . ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a north korean diplomat would be carrying `` illegal items . '' `` it was very tough . we have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat , '' ziauddin said , referring to the vienna convention , which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity . he said the suspect , whom he identified as son young nam , the first secretary of north korea 's embassy in dhaka , initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched . `` he said there is no way we can open or scan his bag , '' ziauddin said . `` at first he said ` this is an electric motor . ' after further questioning he changed his mind and told us , ` these are cipher machines and very confidential . ' '' eventually , customs officers opened the diplomat 's bag and found the undeclared goods , that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments . at current market prices , the gold would be valued at around $ 1 million . entering bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country 's customs regulations . an official with bangladesh 's foreign secretary , speaking to cnn on condition of anonymity , said his government lodged a protest with the north korean ambassador . it 's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds . due to international sanctions , north korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems . `` it would be interesting to see if -lsb- the diplomat -rsb- is disciplined when he gets back '' to north korea , said john delury , associate professor at yonsei university 's graduate school of international studies . `` that would be a way of saying whether or not he 's a corrupt diplomat . '' according to the foreign secretary 's office in bangladesh , the north korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country . cnn 's k.j. kwon contributed from seoul .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- with the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager tony robinson in madison , wisconsin , the racist chanting of fraternity members at the university of oklahoma , and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in ferguson , missouri , it 's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point . and the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve . to approach things from a more positive angle , the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative . the best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse . this unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems , which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them . when things are going wrong , responsible people can begin by saying the right things . president obama said on twitter , `` violence against police is unacceptable . our prayers are with the officers in mo. . path to justice is one all of us must travel together . '' the congressional black caucus issued a statement saying , `` the cbc understands the frustrations in ferguson , but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country . '' and attorney general eric holder noted , `` this was not someone trying to bring healing to ferguson . ... this was a damn punk , a punk who was trying to sow discord . '' for the most part , authorities in missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters . surely , not all responses have been as measured , but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people . while we pause for a moment to let passions cool , we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination . the way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community 's real concerns . and it 's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces . this approach would benefit both the community and the police . i 'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations , as noted in the doj report on ferguson . nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent . one of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats . officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass . being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them . the cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies , he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve . another idea is to give cops bicycles , which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community . lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the doj report on ferguson . in areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide , mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together . after all , both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods . both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level . a tech services company in the south bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood . the event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like `` basically they 're like us . '' ultimately , police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike . communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations . new orleans police det. winston harbin became a minor internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during mardi gras . besides just being fun , harbin 's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing . fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism , unequal treatment , bias , subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity . it is times like now , when that anger and resentment are boiling , that we address it . with the right approach , we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from `` handsupdo n'tshoot '' to `` handstogetherintrust . ''

'' using identity theft technology , the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years , although the treasury department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher . camus said they 've recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers , and it 's increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week . authorities believe the thieves are operating out of india , using phishing technology to make it appear they 're irs agents in washington . call 1 : ` the irs is filing a lawsuit against you ' call 2 : ` your address is under state investigation ' the federal trade commission , which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint , and the treasury department , which leads the criminal probe , both have open investigations . the largest loss reported was a staggering $ 500,000 , camus said . most have lost about $ 5,000 . one of those victims was former nfl player frank garcia , who is now a sports radio host in charlotte , north carolina . when he got the call , it sounded so authentic , he left the radio station in a panic , scramming to get the money they wanted . 12 scams to avoid . `` the only thing running through my head is , i 'm going to jail . i 'm gon na be on television , in handcuffs , for tax evasion , '' he recalled . `` i had to follow specific steps not to be arrested . that the authorities had been contacted and in fact , they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes . '' garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around charlotte , depositing $ 500 each time into a paypal account set up by the woman on the phone . he ended up losing about $ 4,000 . he , and other victims , told cnn the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone . `` i have never been arrested in my life and was very scared , '' said kin ko , a new jersey resident who lost about $ 5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison , and the irs was about to confiscate his assets : his car , his house and all the money in his bank account . the person had a badge number , read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction . the thieves are incredibly smart and convincing . they harness stolen identities and use programs such as google earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money . `` it sounded as legitimate as could be , '' said al cadenhead , a pastor in north carolina who also fell victim . `` they knew where i was . he told me where to go -- to the rite aid , up two streets turn left to the rite aid . the names of the streets , it was really just incredible . '' cadenhead told cnn he did n't come to his senses until he 'd signed over $ 16,000 . identity theft tops list of consumer complaints . `` it was like i came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business , '' he said . `` i know other people who 've heard the story say ` how did a guy with a phd fall victim ? ' i was the perfect victim . i 've never been audited , never paid a traffic ticket . i do n't know how to pay fines . how do i know they are n't stern and serious about everything ? '' camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the irs , so they do whatever the caller says . in december , federal authorities found and arrested two u.s.-based `` runners '' who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts . in many cases , victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations . ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money . if you think you have been a victim of an irs impersonation scam , you can report it to tigta 's web site or call 800-366-4484 . for frank garcia , the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $ 8,000 after he thought his debt had been paid . he says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest -- which , of course , never came . how hackers are stealing your tax refund . `` i felt taken advantage of . i felt small . and i was naive , '' he said . `` i was n't aware . i did n't understand the system . and did n't blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things .

naypyidaw , myanmar -lrb- cnn -rrb- twenty-one people are dead and 21 missing after a ferry capsized in the southeast asia nation of myanmar . myanmar 's ministry of information said in a statement that the ship capsized friday night as it sailed , in bad weather conditions , around the city of sittwe . that 's when a large wave crashed into the ferry , causing it capsize near myaybone and myaukkyine islands . authorities have managed to rescue at least 167 people , according to the information ministry for myanmar , which is also known as burma . pictures from the government showed rescue workers helping people off a boat onto the land . sittwe is the capital of rakhine state and sits on the bay of bengal , about 55 miles -lrb- 90 kilometers -rrb- from the bangladesh border . this weekend 's weather forecast for the city calls for some clouds giving way to clear skies , with high daytime temperatures expected to be in the 30s celsius -lrb- 80s to 90s fahrenheit -rrb- . fatal ferry disasters are nothing new to the region . last month , at least 68 people died when a packed double-decker ferry sank while on the padma river north of neighboring bangladesh 's capital , dhaka , officials said . a cargo vessel hit the ferry , causing it to overturn and trapping passengers on its lower deck . forty-five people died in an accident on the same river in august . in may 2013 , several boats carrying as many as 150 people were thought to have capsized near myanmar 's western coast ahead of a storm approaching the area . those boats were carrying rohingya , members of myanmar 's long-suffering muslim minority , thailand-based u.n. official kirsten mildren said at the time . journalist manny muang reported from myanmar , and cnn 's greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a facebook post by actor ashton kutcher lamenting the lack of diaper changing tables in public men 's rooms has parents talking . the new father -- he and partner mila kunis welcomed baby wyatt isabelle in october -- complained to his followers that he had yet to encounter a changing table in the public bathrooms he visits . he offered to give a social media shout-out to the first business where he found a diapering table in the men 's room . the post had logged more than 230,000 comments as of wednesday morning . lots of folks offered up places kutcher should patronize , such as walmart and cracker barrel , where they say changing tables abound . some dads said they did n't have a problem finding changing tables , but it may be because they 're frequenting more down-to-earth establishments than the hollywood star . other posters said `` family restrooms '' would take care of the problem altogether . do modern dads get enough credit ? many praised kutcher for raising the issue : `` thank you for doing this . this is not just an issue for dad 's such as yourself who are awesome , but so many of the families i know who have two daddies have this issue all the time , '' wrote one poster . another mom agreed : `` my boyfriend was taken aback when he had to get a key for the family change room instead of just going into the men 's with our son because they had no change table . it does n't make any sense . gender equality needs to go both ways .

-lrb- wired -rrb- screens are rectangles . even the 3-year-old playing with your ipad could tell you that . but what would the digital world look like through a different sort of frame ? say ... a circular one ? monohm , a startup based in berkeley , california , was founded around this very idea . for the last year , the three-person team has been working a circular , palm-sized device dubbed runcible . they cheekily refer to it as the `` anti-smartphone , '' a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system . the round device is meant to be the antidote to our feed-obsessed , notification-saturated digital existence . it 's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents . that 's a quixotic dream , but an interesting one . display technologies have a long and rectangular history . before smartphones there were movie screens , tvs , and computers , not to mention paintings and pages of print . and then of course there are windows -- in some ways the original glass rectangles . in each case , the rectangle 's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality . whether you 're talking about film or glass or stone , rectangles are easy to make . they do n't leave much wasted material . as frames for shaping the world , however , different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects . 14 of the best architecture photos from the past year . in her book the virtual window , which traces the rectangular frame from renaissance painting up through microsoft windows , media theorist anne friedberg offers an example from the history of architecture , centering on a public feud between french builder august perret and the preeminent modernist architect le corbusier . perret was a strong advocate of the traditional french casement window , which was oriented vertically . its main function , he said , was to let light into a room . le corbusier , making use of new manufacturing techniques , designed his buildings around long , horizontal windows , which were as much about framing the outside world as illuminating the space within . the disagreement influenced architecture for decades to come . the simple act of turning a rectangle on its side gave us entirely new ways to think about space . rectangles are still subtly dictating our behavior today . movie screens , chased by tvs , have gotten bigger and wider , encouraging us to sit back and lose ourselves in the spectacle . -lrb- in 1930 , russian filmmaker sergei eisenstein lamented how the cinema 's `` passive horizontalism . '' he wanted the screen to be square . -rrb- . smartphones , with their slender , touch-controlled displays , have become a distinctly more active rectangle . paired with the never-ending vertical feeds that fill apps like facebook , instagram , and twitter , they 've become an irresistible , inexhaustible diversion . the point is this : frames matter . they suggest certain things about how we should approach them . they shape the type of stuff that 's made for them . and if just turning a rectangle on its side can make such a big difference , imagine all the interesting things that might happen if you left the rectangle behind altogether . runcible is n't meant to be a smartphone replacement so much as an alternative . `` i think we 've become really , really good at getting interrupted and creating conduits for interruption , '' says monohm ceo aubrey anderson , who met his co-founders during a stint at apple . `` it 's time now to use technology to get a little quieter . '' if miniaturizing the computer is what got us the smartphone , runcible asks what a gizmo might look like if you started by souping up a pocket watch . and the shape of the device is central to that thinking . a circular frame , after all , is no good for browsing a twitter feed . 12 most ancient and magnificent trees from around the world . so what is it good for ? that 's the question . at this point , runcible as much a provocation as an actual product . the three-person team , which has been working with the san francisco design studio box clever on the concept for nearly a year , has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system , but they 've still got a long way to go . they 've got a few vague ideas for applications . one is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts . another is a compass-style mapping system that encourages wandering instead of pure a-to-b efficiency . but they 're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all : they want to see applications that distill information and streamline interaction , software that constrains the smartphone experience as it exists today . all this is easier said than done , of course . throwing out centuries of rectangular thinking and starting from scratch ai n't easy . plus , it 's not clear that people really want constraint to begin with . smartphones are distracting , sure , but they 're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff . still , even as a hint of a possible device , runcible is compelling . for one thing , the company 's hardware model feels great in the hand -lrb- the team 's hardware guy , george arriola , came from sony , where he helped design the playstation 4 . -rrb- the model 's curved back brings to mind the very first iphone -- and makes you consider how each successive generation has become a little bit harder to hold . and though unformed , the vision for the software is interesting too . if today 's interactive rectangles and infinite feeds signal that there 's always more stuff just outside the frame , circles could offer something more self-contained , more complete . maybe even something actively inefficient . rectangles are beautiful and functional . circles are zen . a circular device would sever the link to the printed page , the tv and the computer , and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration . pocket watches and compasses . microscopes and telescopes . peep holes , port holes , and wormholes . dials , buttons , and other circular controls . 15 incredible photos that 'll remind you to be awed by planet earth . if nothing else , the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices . maybe thinking about circles could help us make our rectangles better . runcible is just one scrappy , literal attempt to abandon the rectangle . but similar thinking is happening elsewhere . android wear , google 's smartwatch operating system , reconsiders what apps should look like on a tiny circular display . apple watch is in some ways another rectangle , but its real estate is limited enough that it will also encourage new , less rectangular thinking . -lrb- note how its home screen ditches iphone 's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones . also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds -rrb- . we 've seen how sensors can be harnessed to choreograph experiences that happen outside of the frame entirely , as with disney 's magic bands , which usher you through the company 's parks . and then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality , where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely . here , the screen is less of a window , more of a lens . the only frame is your field of vision . rectangles will endure . they 're easy , they 're efficient . but as new components and manufacturing techniques make it easier to experiment with other forms , we 'll likely find people exploring the unique effects they can produce . just recently , in fact , we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way . in a 10 minute video , google proposed a new headquarters that would leaves boxy buildings behind in favor of tent-like structures draped in glass . these buildings do n't have vertical windows or horizontal windows . they 're nothing but windows , or maybe they 're so radical that the concept of `` window '' does n't even really apply . whatever the case , there 's nothing rectangular about them , and google 's convinced they 're the future . read more from wired : . there 's a super-fast method for boarding planes , but airlines are n't using it . 21 awesomely well-designed products we 're dying to own . what cities would look like if lit only by the stars . subscribe to wired magazine for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 wired.com .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the attempts by some in the gop to undermine president barack obama 's iranian policy certainly seem extraordinary . first , the republican leadership invited benjamin netanyahu to speak to congress without consulting the white house , and he duly warned against softening of the west 's line on iran . now , 47 senators have written an open letter to the iranian regime to advise that any deal agreed to with obama could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election . it is an astonishing move . but this is not , strictly speaking , unique . people in both parties have done far more remarkable things in the past . back in 1983 , sen. edward kennedy tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the soviet union -- effectively sidestepping president ronald reagan . working through proxies , he suggested that he visit moscow to meet with the communist leadership and offered to help them make their case to the american people as to why they preferred dialogue over confrontation . as washington post journalist vincent bzdek notes in his book `` the kennedy legacy , '' this occurred close to a u.s. presidential election , and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the logan act , which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy . one might argue that the senator was motivated by high ideals : he had a clear record of campaigning to reduce cold war tensions and thought reagan was mishandling the soviets . on more than one occasion , kennedy politicized foreign policy while in the senate . in my book on the 1980 democratic presidential primaries , i note that kennedy opposed jimmy carter 's hard-line stance on the soviet invasion of afghanistan -- a position that was well-intentioned , prophetic and somewhat advantageous to kennedy 's campaign for the democratic nomination . but it 's not only democrats who have done that . step forward , richard nixon . in 1968 , the presidential election looked close . with the johnson administration edging toward a peace deal in vietnam , nixon 's team rolled the dice . according to an account in politico , anna chennault , a republican activist , was given a message to pass onto the south vietnamese government : if they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn , the democrats would lose the election and nixon as the next president would offer them better terms . the south vietnamese indeed proved intransigent , and the republicans won the white house . no evidence exists directly tying nixon personally to the conspiracy , but we now know for sure that it happened and it 's far hard to imagine that it would have gone ahead without his knowledge . there is a view that it bordered on treason and -- again -- makes the 2015 gop efforts look tame by comparison . the extreme lengths that kennedy and nixon went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority . it 's true that the spirit of the constitution indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the president . but such harmony has n't always been possible . recall that congress and the carter white house tore themselves apart over the panama canal treaties . that the reagan administration 's policy in nicaragua was so controversial that his staffers sent aid to the rebels through back channels , and the then-democratic house speaker , jim wright , was accused of presenting a private peace plan to the left-wing government . that bill clinton 's 1994 nuclear deal with north korea was criticized by both republicans and democrats . or that liberal democrats did their best to defund the iraq war . as damian paletta writes , foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the white house through executive agreements that pass without comment . but the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is naïve , and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate . the particular matter of the iran talks is sensitive for the republicans because it involves the electoral holy trinity of obama , israel and the presidential primaries . they were n't going to walk away from this one , and we can hardly be surprised that they have n't . the democrats would do the same if the situation were reversed , as they have many times in the past . in a republic purposefully designed to have limited executive power , with a competitive two-party system bolted on to keep its politics fluid , this was arguably inevitable .

karachi , pakistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- suicide bombers attacked a christian community in eastern pakistan on sunday , setting off two blasts that killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more , officials said . the pakistani taliban claimed responsibility for the deadly attack and warned of more to come . the explosions , which struck the nishtar colony area in the city of lahore , wounded at least 78 people , said dr. muhammed saeed sohbin , medical superintendent at lahore general hospital . video from the scene aired by cnn affiliate geo news showed twisted metal , shattered glass and panicked residents outside a church compound . ambulance and security personnel were seen moving in . later footage showed water cannons arriving to disperse the crowd . ehsanullah ehsan , a spokesman for the pakistani taliban , said by telephone that his group was responsible for the suicide bombings , declaring that such attacks would continue until sharia law is implemented in pakistan . after a period of disunity , the terrorist group 's three major splinter groups announced last week that they were joining forces again under the name tehrik-i-taliban , or ttp . the pakistani military has been waging a campaign against the militant group in north waziristan , one of the loosely governed tribal areas bordering afghanistan . pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif , whose government held unsuccessful peace talks with the ttp last year , strongly condemned sunday 's attack , according to a statement from his office . sharif asked provincial governments to tighten security and `` take all possible measures '' to protect people and property , the statement said . the last major attack on pakistan 's christian community took place in 2013 , when suicide bombers struck a church in the northwestern city of peshawar , killing more than 80 people . more recently , a christian couple were burned to death in november by mob that accused them of blasphemy . `` the christian community is a soft target for militant outfits in pakistan , '' said rabia mehmood , a researcher at the jinnah institute , a pakistani think tank . `` but generally christians and other religious minorities are under a constant threat by the extremist elements in the society and rampant religious intolerance . '' on sunday , pope francis said he learned of the attacks `` with pain , with much pain . '' he called for peace in pakistan and said that persecution of christians does n't get the attention it deserves . the pope prayed that `` this persecution against christians , which the world tries to hide , might end , and that there be peace . '' other minorities in the predominantly sunni muslim nation have also been targeted this year . last month , an attack on a shiite mosque in peshawar killed at least 19 worshipers and injured dozens of others . the pakistani taliban reportedly claimed responsibility for that attack , too . cnn 's sophia saifi reported from karachi , pakistan , and jethro mullen wrote from hong kong . cnn 's brian walker and journalists saleem mehsud and adeel raja contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- closed for over a decade , a trail that 's been described as `` the world 's most dangerous path '' will no longer be off limits to the public thanks to a massive reconstruction project . due to reopen march 26 , spain 's stunning caminito del rey features a cliff face boardwalk that hangs 100 meters above the guadalhorce river . the trail , which begins in the village of el chorro in southern malaga province , has been around since the early 1900s , originally built to provide access to two waterfalls for hydroelectric workers . over the years , the boardwalk deteriorated and , following a string of fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000 , the government demolished the access points to the walkway . the reopening , which comes over a year since reconstruction efforts kicked off , coincides with spain 's annual holy week celebrations . according to the spanish daily el pais , the provincial government allocated 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- to the project . the entire route is 7.7 kilometers long , with boardwalks covering 2.9 kilometers of the trail . the most famous section includes the balconcillo de los gaitanes bridge , which spans the gaitanes gorge . tourism officials say it takes between four and five hours to walk the entire route , which includes some steep slopes . entry will be free for the first six months after the attraction reopens on march 26 . visiting hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. from april 1 to october 31 , and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. from november 1 to march 31 . those who want to visit need to book a spot on the official website , caminitodelrey.info .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the rev. fred craddock , the pulpit giant who was `` like no other preacher you have ever heard , '' has died , his church announced . craddock , who redefined the art of preaching , died friday in blue ridge , georgia . the cause has not been disclosed . the 86-year-old had been in declining health due to parkinson 's disease in recent years , according to the united methodist reporter . `` fred craddock was a national treasure and a devoted servant of the church and jesus christ . his impact on preaching -- in terms both of scholarship and practice -- is incalculable , '' said the rev. thomas long , a friend and a pastor at emory university 's candler school of theology . craddock faces his toughest convert . preachers studied classic craddock sermons such as `` have you heard john preach ? '' and `` grace and disgrace , '' much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to saxophonist john coltrane and amateur boxers studied tapes of sugar ray robinson -- for clues to greatness and inspiration . craddock elevated preaching to an art . he was often called a preaching genius . rather than deliver a sermon like a lecture -- an intro , three main points and a conclusion -- he developed an `` inductive '' conversational style of preaching . his sermons unfolded like a short story -- there was foreshadowing , plot twists , dialogue ; language of startling beauty and surprise endings . the way he ended his sermons was as memorable as what he said . he would abruptly stop , turn from the pulpit , and quietly sit as the audience sat in silence . people did n't applaud or shout hallelujah after his sermons . they were too busy absorbing what he had just said . the rev. barbara brown taylor , an author and world-renowned preacher , once said of craddock : `` he spoke of kierkegaard as easily as he spoke of the indianapolis 500 . he quoted kafka as helpfully as corinthians ... but he was also someone who noticed a lot about ordinary human life on earth . '' craddock , who taught preaching at the candler school of theology until his retirement , was selected as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the english-speaking world in a poll of 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals in 1996 . i had a chance to meet craddock , as well as hear him . i spent several weeks with him in the autumn of 2011 to write a profile about his relationship with his father . he was just as impressive outside the pulpit . he would ease his rotund little body in a wooden chair and share touching stories about growing up poor in the small town of humboldt , tennessee , during the depression with an alcoholic father . he 'd talk about the infirmities of old age -- i remember saying with a chuckle that `` i should have something '' when referring to his bout with parkinson 's because he was getting old . he was funny , folksy , witty and his eyes danced with glee when he told a story . sitting in craddock 's presence was like listening to a wise uncle or grandmother . he had courtly , southern manners , and he gave the impression that he had all the time in the world for you . i never once heard him criticize anyone . it 's not uncommon to meet great people who , to borrow a phrase that craddock used , have `` domestic wreckage '' at home . but the craddock family was among his biggest fans . he was married to his high school sweetheart , nettie , for more than 50 years , and they had two children , laura and john . laura named her son after her father . and john , who became a ceo instead of a pastor , said his father was the most remarkable man he knew . `` i do n't care if it 's a guy on the street asking for a dollar or the president of the united states , he makes you feel as if you 're the most important person in the world when he 's talking to you , '' said john craddock . `` i won the lottery as far as great fathers go . '' over the years , i kept in contact with him . i 'd go to preaching workshops at his beloved craddock center , a non-profit ministry that served needy children in north georgia , tennessee and north carolina . the center provides books , hot meals , storytelling and music . perhaps craddock saw something of himself in the kids he helped . one thing is certain : he was n't content to preach compassion . he lived that message . craddock 's funeral will be held at 2 p.m. monday at cherry log christian church in blue ridge , georgia . people we 've lost in 2015 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` this is going to be a test for serena williams . we 're going to find out what she 's made of . how mentally tough she really is . '' those were the words of tennis analyst mary joe fernandez in 2001 , early into serena williams ' decider with kim clijsters in the final of one of tennis ' most prestigious tournaments . the match was being televised on one of the biggest sports networks in the world , espn . the then 17-year-old clijsters had just held to love amid vociferous cheers and -- in a breach of tennis etiquette -- a large portion of the fans on center court at the event now known as the bnp paribas open roared approvingly when williams struck a double fault to begin the next game . despite williams growing up about 130 miles away in a suburb of los angeles , while clijsters hailed from belgium , there was clearly no home-court advantage . williams ' father , richard , and older sister , venus , were booed as they made their way to their seats prior to the finale , with richard claiming in usa today he was the victim of racial abuse . venus williams , meanwhile , said in a press conference at her next tournament she `` heard whatever he heard . '' it was richard williams who shaped his daughters into grand slam winners from a humble background , bereft of the type of money used to help manufacture many a champion . `` one guy said , ' i wish it was ' 75 , we 'd skin you alive , ' '' richard williams told usa today . `` i had trouble holding back tears . i think indian wells disgraced america . '' charlie pasarell , then the tournament director , said in the same story that he did n't discount richard williams was racially abused . cnn.com did not hear back from pasarell when it put in an interview request for him and clijsters declined an interview request . the fans ' reaction apparently stemmed from the sisters ' semifinal -- or lack of it . venus williams pulled out a mere minutes prior to the start , citing a knee injury . whispers of richard williams pre-determining the outcome grew , no doubt aided by the comments of elena dementieva . after venus williams beat dementieva in the quarterfinals , the russian said the sisters ' father would `` decide '' who won . serena williams , who was 19 back then , ultimately passed the ` test ' that day against clijsters , judging by the result : a three-set win . serena williams has certainly , too , shown her mental toughness over the years , adding 18 grand slam singles titles to the one she won prior to 2001 . but what transpired tarnished the tournament , the sport and hurt one of tennis ' all-time greats to such an extent that she stayed away from indian wells . until now . serena williams plays her first match in indian wells in 14 years on friday , saying she was `` following her heart '' in deciding to return . in the years that have passed since 2001 , williams went from teen to young adult to veteran , all the while collecting major titles elsewhere . `` it has been difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the indian wells locker room after winning in 2001 , driving back to los angeles feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , '' serena williams told time.com in february . `` emotionally it seemed easier to stay away . `` there are some who say i should never go back . there are others who say i should 've returned years ago . i understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time . `` i 'm just following my heart on this one . '' raymond moore , a former owner of the tournament and now its chief executive , was `` elated '' to have serena williams back in the field . `` in the past , the things that happened , there were no winners , '' moore told cnn.com . `` i think it was a terrible incident . regrettable from all sides . now , serena has been able to change that . we 're grateful , excited and happy and we 're going to welcome her with open arms . `` in terms of her reception , i would like her to be here feeling that her decision was received with the greatest and warmest reception possible . '' but serena williams will be the lone grand slam winner in her family attending . serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at indian wells . even with the best efforts of the tournament -- now owned by billionaire larry ellison -- venus williams is continuing her boycott , as is richard williams , according to moore . the siblings ' mom , oracene price , will be alongside serena williams , though , added moore . serena williams told reporters in indian wells on thursday that her father , mother and venus williams gave her their blessing when she contemplated coming back to indian wells . `` we wanted to get venus , '' said moore . `` in fact we 'd like to welcome the whole family . but venus i think is not quite in the same place as serena is . and so we 've not been successful in enticing her to enter or take a wild card . `` but oracene is coming and so are some other family members . '' serena williams scoffed at suggestions that the sisters ' match in indian wells -- or any other between them -- was fixed . `` throughout my whole career , integrity has been everything to me , '' she told time . `` it is also everything and more to venus . the false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt , cut and ripped into us deeply . `` the under-current of racism was painful , confusing and unfair . in a game i loved with all my heart , at one of my most cherished tournaments , i suddenly felt unwelcome , alone and afraid . '' reflecting on the incident , bart mcguire , the chief executive of the women 's tour in 2001 , said venus williams had been suffering from a genuine injury and that the notion that richard williams dictated the outcome of matches between his daughters was off the mark . but he admitted things could have been handled better . venus williams , for example , might have explained her withdrawal to fans on court and then signed autographs , he said , citing the example of last year 's world tour finals . roger federer withdrew from the final in london -- but not before he addressed fans and signed autographs . what happened in the final between serena williams and clijsters was awful , said mcguire . `` i thought it was horrible , '' he told cnn.com . `` i thought it was very tough on the players . `` by that time i 'd known enough to know that venus had been significantly injured and that it was not a set-up of any kind . i thought it was unfair to serena and kim . '' serena williams is twice a champion at the tournament and winning this year would be `` fantastic , '' said moore . but even if not , he added : `` i think it 's a wonderful ending in closing an ugly chapter . we 're just looking forward , we 're not looking backward . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the news was stunning to hear : a young woman , 18-year-old michelle carter , was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide . how could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased , conrad roy , 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing ? and what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text ? but a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe , life-altering legal consequences . that is why lisa green , author of the informative new book `` on your case : a compassionate -lrb- and only slightly bossy -rrb- legal guide for every stage of a woman 's life , '' believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case . `` to me this is the unrecognized area that parents , particularly parents of teens , miss all the time , '' said green during a recent interview at cnn 's studios . `` so many of our friends have armies of tutors , extracurricular activities , all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law , there 's this black hole . '' mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . green , a journalist , lawyer and television legal analyst , says people often think of the law as scary and intimidating and believe they do n't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble . whether it 's a case as serious as carter 's involuntary manslaughter charge , or a simple allegation of vandalism , parents need to be prepared , green said . `` i can not count the number of kids i know , good kids , who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time , '' said green . `` i have now two young adults , and when they were going through their teenage years , it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong , a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions , bringing something to school they should n't have . `` and in each of those cases , a little bit of knowledge of the law , a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are , the right way to behave , would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief . '' green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone , or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the sat . parents ' house seized after son 's drug bust . `` i am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what 's available to you to help you parent better , '' she said . she gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age . for instance , what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts ? what parents should know , green said , is that a school ca n't open a cell phone for no reason at all . `` they need to have reasonable suspicion that something 's wrong , '' said green , who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what 's appropriate and what 's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials . `` if you 're asked , as a child , for a locker search , to open a phone , to open a laptop , if it 's your property , pause and ask if you could call mom and dad , '' she said . `` we can act whether we 're lawyers or not as that first line of defense . '' green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school 's code of conduct . `` they do n't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say , ` who can i party with ? ' but it 's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance '' for activities such as drinking on campus , she said . and even before teens head off to college , parents should know about social host laws , where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic . scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . more than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books , according to mothers against drunk driving . in some cases , parents can be held liable even if they did n't know the drinking was taking place . `` it does n't have to be you with the shaker , like an episode of ` mad men , ' serving up manhattans to a group of grateful teens , '' said green . `` if you 've made it possible in your home , if you do n't lock your liquor cabinet -- i never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking , that could be a problem as well . '' while green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law , she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home . `` i am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility . if a kid does something wrong , if they broke the law , they ought to be punished appropriately by it . but we also live in a society where we have legal rights , and i want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment . '' so if after reading this , you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer , how on earth do you go about finding one ? green 's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association , since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues . then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers , asking them everything from how much their services would cost -lrb- that can vary -rrb- , to who would handle the work , to what their philosophy is about the law and teens ' rights . `` you may or may not end up being friends afterwards , but that 's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you . '' do you think it 's important for parents of teens to be aware of the law and their children 's legal rights ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace -lrb- @kellywallacetv -rrb- on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- outside of israeli politics , isaac herzog is not a well-known name . that may change on march 17 , when israelis head to the polls for election day . in the final round of polling before the elections , herzog 's zionist union party is in the lead , holding a four-seat edge over prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's likud party . `` i believe in a certain type of leadership that is not always customary in this region . i 'm not a general . i do n't give orders . i know how to work together , '' he says . throughout the campaign , herzog has been seen as an underdog , lacking the charisma and the english fluency of netanyahu . herzog says that does n't bother him at all . `` i have always suffered from a certain underestimation , '' herzog said , `` and i have always surprised . '' he promised , `` i will surprise again , and i will show my leadership and stamina . '' herzog began his political career in 2003 , when he first won a seat in the knesset with the labor party . he held a variety of ministerial positions , including minister of housing and construction , minister of tourism , and minister of welfare and social services , before becoming leader of the labor party in 2013 . in those elections , he also became the leader of the opposition , as benjamin netanyahu won another term as prime minister . but when netanyahu called for early elections in 2014 , herzog pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform . `` what i run for is social justice . i will change the nature of the division of wealth in a fair and more balanced way , close inequality and give a sense of purpose to the people here in the workplace , in the housing , and in the cost of living , '' promised herzog . before the election , the issue of a nuclear iran garnered international headlines as it further aggravated tense relations between the white house and netanyahu . herzog , in a speech almost immediately after netanyahu 's address to congress , promised to work with the united states and european powers , not against , to ensure the safety of israel . he echoed that sentiment in an interview with cnn 's elise labott . `` a nuclear-armed iran is dangerous to world peace , is dangerous to our region , is dangerous to israel . as leader of israel , i will never accept a nuclear-armed iran . never . and all options are on the table . '' in these elections , negotiations with the palestinians have n't been one of the major issues , but herzog promised to restart the stalled peace talks with the palestinian authority . `` i will do my best to ignite a political process with our palestinian neighbors . ... although i can not promise 100 % results , i promise 100 % effort . '' herzog comes from israeli political royalty . his grandfather , rabbi yitzhak halevi herzog , was the first chief rabbi of the state of israel . his father , chaim herzog , was an army general , an ambassador to the united nations and the president of israel . herzog believes it is his destiny to be the next prime minister of israel . `` what i carry with me is a unique legacy , a family legacy , but most important , an experience that brings me to be able to lead our nation .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- thirty years ago , a journey across europe meant a passport full of stamps , a wallet full of different currencies and plenty of time spent waiting in line to be glared at by border officials . that all began to change in june 1985 , when the continent 's countries began signing up to the schengen agreement -- a deal that lifted frontier controls between cooperating neighbors . today , 20 years after it came into force , with more than 26 states now participating , schengen has completely altered the experience of traversing europe . nowhere is this more visible than at the old crossing points -- places that were once hives of activity but are now ghostly , vacated shells of their former selves . not entirely forgotten though . spanish photographer ignacio evangelista spent several years criss-crossing the continent to capture these abandoned checkpoints on camera for a project he calls `` after schengen . '' the result is a fascinating gallery of images that charts the unusual architecture of places whose fate has been intertwined with europe 's ever-evolving political and economic allegiances . `` i do n't know why but from many years ago , i feel very attracted to situations or places where the natural and the artificial come together , sometimes a little bit in conflict , '' evangelista tells cnn , explaining his interest in frontiers . he says he spent his formative years poring over the world atlas , marveling at the straight-line borders carved by colonialists across the map of africa and wondering why europeans could n't iron the kinks out of their own squiggled frontiers . `` when you are a young child in front of a map you feel ... you have the whole world in front of you and you can travel with your mind of course , with your imagination , '' he says . as a young adult in the early 1990s , evangelista experienced many of these borders firsthand when he embarked on an interailing trip -- a country-hopping rite of passage that sees many young europeans take advantage of cheap pan-continental train tickets . `` before , when i was young , if you traveled from spain to germany you had to cross three countries and take three currencies , '' he recalls . `` once i was traveling with my friend , interailing ... from italy to greece , we had to cross the old yugoslavia . `` i think into the night , 2 or 3 a.m. , we cross the border from italy into yugoslavia and the train stopped . we were sleeping , of course . then three or four soldiers come into the train and shouted at everybody , very aggressively , like in a spy movie . `` we waited half an hour , then half an hour later the train went on . it was exciting , even funny as i was 18 years old , but now it 's not so funny . '' as evangelista points out , in a europe cleaved by the cold war , many borders were not just the cultural dividing lines they are today . back then they were fortifications demarcating places of oppression and freedom . the checkpoints themselves were sometimes places of fear , of hostile bureaucracy -- a past evangelista says lingers on in the buildings left behind . `` for me it 's fascinating because you can see the passage of the time , the human footprint . `` these places had a very strong coercive role , people had to stop the car and the policeman had to ask you who you are , you showed your passport , maybe you had to open your bags . the police had the power to not let you go on . `` it 's interesting to me , looking at these places now they are a little bit spooky , because at most of them you can feel this ghostly atmosphere . '' the frontier buildings range in size and style , from giant soviet declarations of authority that loom over major highways to tiny huts in deep , dark forests . europe 's richer countries tend to maintain old posts , while less wealthier states seem content to let them deteriorate , evangelista says . some , he says , are gone completely , marked only on maps and located using gps trackers or by talking to locals . a strong supporter for an open europe at a time when some of the continent 's nations are talking about severing the close economic and political bonds they share with their neighbors , evangelista recalls one encounter that underscored the human side to his project . while setting up his camera at a checkpoint on the austria-hungary frontier , he watched as a man drove in from the austrian side and parked , followed by a woman , two minutes later , from the hungarian side . `` they began to speak and they were kissing very much . after 10 minutes they went back their separate ways , and i thought , before the schengen agreement , this couple had no future .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 'm candida moss and i am professor of new testament and early christianity at the university of notre dame . i was an adviser on the `` true cross '' episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in cnn 's `` finding jesus '' series , which currently airs on sundays . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page during the show . below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them . my apologies to everyone i did n't get to . feel free to tweet your questions to me directly . herb scribner : can anyone explain to me what the bible 's deal is with 40 days/nights ? moss : it 's more an interest in the number 40 . in the hebrew bible the people of israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the holy land . the flood lasts for 40 days and nights ; moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain ; goliath spends 40 days encouraging the israelites to challenge him before david steps up ; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married ; in the book of judges it is always 40 years between judges ; and david and solomon each reigned for 40 years . what we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full , complete period of time . it 's sort of like a narrative stock number , in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three . yalanda m. price : was there any division between the followers of jesus and the followers of john the baptist ? moss : one of the interesting things about the relationship between jesus and john the baptist is that john does n't lay down his tools and follow jesus after he baptizes him . nor , it seems , did john 's disciples . they had separate ministries and , while there may have been contact between the two groups , they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace . there are some hints in the new testament that jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from john by stating that jesus ' baptism was better -lrb- acts 11:6 -rrb- and countering the idea that jesus was actually john raised from the dead -lrb- matthew 14:2 -rrb- some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of jesus and followers of john . mark goodacre answers your questions about the shroud of turin . jeffery graff : can the dna tests on the bones indicate whether he is a jew or even whether he is of the tribe of levi ? moss : i 'm so glad someone brought up dna . the dna tests on the bulgarian bones yielded only mitochondrial dna -lrb- dna passed down by the mother -rrb- , not the more reliable nuclear dna -lrb- the kind of dna referred to in forensic investigations -rrb- . in the original study of the bulgarian relics -lrb- of which i was a part -rrb- the mitochondrial dna revealed that the bulgarian relics were of `` probable semitic origin . '' thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the copenhagen scientists , i recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 % . the episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a middle-eastern man . as for the more specific question about the genetics of jews and members of the tribe of levi : current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start-up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information . cyndi rosenthal : are there any other historical references of john the baptist outside of the bible ? daniel josé camacho : any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of john the baptist ? moss : -lrb- these questions are on a similar topic , so i 've chosen to answer them together . -rrb- actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of john the baptist . this is important because it 's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers . the jewish historian josephus mentions john the baptist in his book , `` the jewish antiquities . '' josephus describes john as a `` good man '' who possessed `` virtue '' and had `` great influence '' over the people . according to josephus , herod put john the baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion . this gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why john was executed and provides further evidence about just how important john was in his own day . watch the latest full episode anytime on cnngo . daniel josé camacho : wait , how did jesus get `` our father '' prayer from johnny b ??? did n't catch that . moss : i 'm also really glad someone brought this up , because i wondered about it too . in the gospel of luke , one of jesus ' disciples says , `` lord , teach us to pray , as john taught his disciples . '' it 's an interesting request that tells us something about john the baptist 's ministry and the demanding characters of jesus ' disciples ! in luke , jesus responds to this request by teaching them the lord 's prayer . we do n't know that the lord 's prayer came from john , and personally i do n't think it did ; i think this is just how luke shaped his version of events . but if you were just reading luke you could come to that conclusion .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- could mobile technology turn the tide in the fight to eliminate racism from football ? anti-racism organization kick it out -lrb- kio -rrb- says there 's been a 35 % rise in fans reporting abusive behavior committed by other fans -- and that 's largely due to a new phone app . `` the app has had a massive impact , '' kio media and communications manager richard bates told cnn , noting that it accounted for 27 % of all complaints . `` self-policing is so important when it comes to stamping out racism in football . people are confident that their complaints will be taken seriously . '' the 184 reported incidents recorded during the last five months of 2014 covered racial and religious discrimination , as well as sexual orientation , gender and disability offenses . the increase was measured against the same period the year before . kio 's mobile phone application , which was released in 2013 , encourages fans to report incidents anonymously by pressing a `` report it ! '' tab and entering the name of the football ground , positioning of the offender , and incident details . although contact details of the person reporting the incident are requested , kio emphasized that the anonymity of the tool is key . every single objection logged by fans , either on the phone , via email , or on the app , triggers an investigation by the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- . these include 73 incidents on social media -lrb- a 24 % increase -rrb- , which have so far led to 21 instances of the offender being identified , and at times having their accounts deleted . the fa , which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013 , encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents . `` reporting abuse , whether witnessed or experienced , is an important part of the game 's overall anti-discrimination work , '' said an fa spokesperson . `` there are clear ways for players and fans to do this , and these improved procedures should result in more reports in the future . '' bates admitted that it takes `` bravery and courage '' for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones , but pointed to the effect british expatriate paul nolan has had after he filmed chelsea fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the paris metro last month . the amateur video obtained by the guardian newspaper , and posted on its website , shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at richelieu-drouot station , only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers . the chelsea fans can then be heard chanting : `` we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' chelsea were in france to play paris saint-germain in a champions league first-leg tie - europe 's premier football tournament -- which finished 1-1 . five people have been identified and suspended by chelsea , who have launched an ongoing investigation . later in february , kio says it contacted the police over social media footage which showed men , thought to be west ham fans , singing anti-semitic songs on a train while traveling to tottenham hotspur 's white hart lane ground ahead of an english premier league game . `` would we know that these paris and london incidents had happened if they were n't on video ? '' bates asks , adding that kio is considering an option to upload video and still images of offenders directly to a complaint log on the app . `` if you have video footage and you can issue that retrospectively , it can make it easier to identify the perpetrators , '' he says . in a report released in 2013 entitled `` english football 's inclusion and anti-discrimination action plan '' , the fa explicitly talks about `` raising confidence in the reporting and disciplinary process at grassroots level . '' kio 's jurisdiction extends to all of english football , including the amateur ranks . it is one of the few independent bodies in world sports which solicits complaints from fans in order to weed out abusive behavior . it also polices the actions of players , which has embroiled the organization in controversy of its own in the past . in 2012 , rio ferdinand refused to wear a kio t-shirt before a match while playing for manchester united . he was protesting a perceived lack of response by the governing bodies against john terry after the chelsea defender was accused of racially abusing his brother , anton ferdinand of queens park rangers . terry was banned for four matches and fined # 220,000 by the fa for his actions .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across brazil this weekend , incensed by serious economic woes and a massive scandal involving the country 's oil company . the demonstrators have called for president dilma rousseff to be impeached . cnn correspondent shasta darlington , who lives in sao paulo , explains who the demonstrators are , why they 're mad and what could be in store for the president and the country . what do the protesters want ? they 're angry about the country 's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged . if it were just one of those things , maybe we would n't be seeing this kind of turnout because brazilians have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in october . but it 's all come to a head . political corruption -- let 's break that down . what 's the scandal about ? petrobras is the national oil company . it 's one of the most powerful , richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world . it was very respected . people invested in it . rousseff , who won election in october by a slim margin , was -- before becoming president -- the chairwoman of petrobras ' board of directors . she was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to petrabras executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from petrobras . in early march , the country 's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians , many of them from the president 's ruling workers ' party and the speakers of the house and senate . but rousseff has n't been accused of anything , right ? right . she 's not being investigated . protesters ' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing , because she 's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely . but , the public perception is that even if she did n't personally profit for this scheme , she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable . has she responded to the protesters ? she has . what she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she 's rooting it out . as proof , she contends , she 's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company . it 's important to know that the petrobras scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during rousseff 's election campaign , she said over and over that she would root out corruption . it 's also interesting that she is n't lashing out at protesters . she is saying she wo n't put up with violence -- and so far the protests have n't gotten violent . but she says that brazil is a democratic country and people have the right to protest . she comes from a left-wing background so that approach is fitting . you brought up that she is from the left-wing workers ' party . how is that significant ? the protests were mostly organized by the right-wing party that opposes rousseff ... organized by people who did n't vote for her . there are n't people out today protesting . the next demonstrations are scheduled for april 12 . i guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that . yes , well , that 's brazil . it 's so the word can get out on social media . if she 's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated , will the protests affect her presidency ? rousseff has four years ahead of her , it could end up being very hard for her govern . she won a little over half the vote in october and the people who did n't vote for her are still making their voices heard . and this petrobras scandal is a problem . why was the election so close ? you have to bring it back to the economy . it had been slowing down , and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like sao paulo have n't voted for rousseff 's party , the workers ' party . the country is at 7.5 % inflation . the april 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road , what might happen ? the senate and house speakers are rousseff 's allies and they are among those implicated in the petrobras scheme . what if she is n't able to get badly needed legislation ? what will she do ? what will be party do ? these questions are hard to answer now . cnn 's ashley fantz in atlanta talked with cnn 's shasta darlington who lives and reports in brazil .
new delhi -lrb- cnn -rrb- thankfully , no one was wounded after crude bombs were hurled at a tamil news station in india on thursday . but the loud explosions injured a vital part of the world 's largest democracy : free speech . last week , when india 's government and a british documentarian faced off over a film featuring a man imprisoned for a 2012 gang rape in south delhi , a little-known channel hundreds of miles away in southern india was waging its own battle . hardline hindu groups were angry with broadcaster puthiya thalaimurai for filming a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace -- called mangalsutra in hindi and thaali in tamil -- worn by married indian women . for them , the contents , as shown in the promos , were offensive to hindu culture . the station planned to release the program sunday , international women 's day . but it canceled the telecast after demonstrations took place outside its office . protesters allegedly attacked one of its cameramen . four days later , the channel came under fire again , when four men on two motorbikes threw bombs into its compound in a predawn attack , authorities say . six people involved in the bombing have been arrested , said s. george , the commissioner of the southern indian city of chennai . their leader turned himself in separately , claiming responsibility for the attack , police said . `` the show wanted to give women a platform . we welcome all opinions and thoughts . but you can not strangle freedom of free expression by violent means and threats , '' said shyam kumar , the ceo of new generation media corp. , which runs puthiya thalaimurai . `` we condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms , '' he told cnn . ` india 's daughter , ' the film banned by india : what did it show ? but india is no stranger to censorship imposed legally or forced by rowdy protesters . the country 's constitution guarantees freedom of expression , but not without restrictions . communities or people claiming their religious sentiments were hurt by anyone else 's opinion can file a lawsuit . authorities can seek restraining orders from local courts -- as they did to ban the recent bbc documentary `` india 's daughter '' -- by citing potential disorder . earlier last year , penguin india withdrew `` the hindus : an alternative history , '' a book by american academic wendy doniger , after a local advocacy group accused the writer of denigrating hinduism . in december , a bollywood movie , `` pk , '' came under attack over similar accusations when mobs tore apart its posters in parts of india . a satire on religious rituals , `` pk '' became a roaring success by being one of the country 's highest-grossing movies . but india , home to one of the world 's largest film industries , has blocked several movies from screening . at least two films were not allowed last year . one of them featured the lives of the sikh assassins of prime minister indira gandhi , and the other centered on the violence in sri lanka in the closing months of its civil war . hounded by protests over his novel , perumal murugan , a tamil author , announced quitting writing in a dramatic post on facebook in january . `` perumal murugan , the writer is dead . as he is no god , he is not going to resurrect himself . he has no faith in rebirth . as an ordinary teacher , he will live as p murugan . leave him alone , '' he said on facebook two months ago . religious and caste-based organizations had slammed his novel `` madhorubhagan , '' which depicted a childless wife taking part in an ancient festival allowing consensual sex between strangers . just last week , india blocked the bbc from airing `` india 's daughter '' because it included comments from one of the men convicted of raping a young student in a moving bus in new delhi in 2012 . the reason : the inmate 's views could create unrest . `` there 's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion . it 's a medieval mindset . what india needs is a concerted effort to move beyond it and embrace free expression in totality , '' said kumar , the new generation media chief executive .
jakarta -lrb- cnn -rrb- turkish officials have detained 16 indonesian citizens who confessed they were planning to cross the border into syria , indonesia 's foreign ministry said . the group comprises a man , four women , three girls and eight boys , said spokesman arrmanatha nasir . the ages of the children have not been released . nasir told reporters on friday that the group was stopped in the southeastern turkish city of gaziantep , just north of the city of aleppo in syria . they admitted to officials they planned to enter syria , nasir said . the indonesian government is sending a security team to turkey to investigate the group 's objectives and plans and to increase cooperation with turkish security officials , nasir said . this group of 16 indonesians is different from another 16 indonesians who reportedly deserted their tour group recently in turkey and are feared to have crossed into syria . nasir confirmed these are two separate groups .

'' ricciardo experienced the full extent of f1 's cruelty at last year 's melbourne race . the australian crossed the line in second place -- seemingly becoming the first aussie to finish on the podium at albert park -- but jubilation soon turned to despair . he was disqualified hours after the race when officials ruled his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate , a rule which states each car is limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per race and was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient . `` it 's frustrating , i mean it 's a part of the sport which will always be frustrating , '' said the 25-year-old , reflecting on what was his red bull debut . `` i 'm sure even lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and nico -lrb- rosberg -rrb- last year were frustrated at the times because you never have the perfect car , '' he added , referring to the two mercedes drivers , who finished first and second last season . `` but it is what it is , i signed up for that a long time ago , and you just learn to accept it . '' it 's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion hamilton was forced to retire from last year 's race at albert park . but technical blunders do n't always end in disaster -- hamilton won the italian grand prix after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race , and finnish driver valterri bottas lost a wheel in 2014 's opener before roaring to a fifth-place finish . despite ricciardo 's previous disappointment , he 's ca n't wait to race on his home turf again next sunday . `` i definitely feel privileged to have a home race ... it just increases all the hype and all the excitement '' said ricciardo , adding that he would use `` all the australian flags and all the cheers to my advantage . '' after last year 's disaster ricciardo is looking to make things right , `` there 's a little bit of redemption , i 'm confident we can get it back . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a striking image : a new baby cradled in the american flag , held by a navy sailor whose face we ca n't see . but is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the american flag ? navy veteran vanessa hicks , a virginia beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents , shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her facebook page . `` i do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an american , '' hicks told cnn affiliate wtkr . `` that flag , the uniform , that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting . '' not everyone agreed with hicks , herself a navy wife whose husband is deployed . a facebook page titled `` you call yourself a photographer ? '' posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture . the u.s. flag code does state that the flag should never be used as `` wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery . it should never be festooned , drawn back , nor up , in folds , but always allowed to fall free , '' according to a congressional research service report -lrb- pdf -rrb- . nor should it be `` used as a receptacle for receiving , holding , carrying , or delivering anything . '' the threatening private messages , which she has reported to facebook , saddened her . but she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag . most people posting to the critical facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture . wrote one poster , `` i am a veteran and find this picture beautiful . clearly the military member loves his country and baby . '' `` the photo is making a point , '' another photo fan posted . `` the flag represents our republic , the republic is supporting our future . there is nothing disrespectful about this use of our flag . it is beautiful .

'' but we 're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time . our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users . but they also have a hidden , darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about . as part of a research project with alberto rizzoli , we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches . one participant , a judge , hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention . the dilemma is familiar to many of us . we spend our days engaged in social interaction . huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues . however when we are in these meetings , our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up . we may want to check these incoming messages , but know it would be rude to glance at our phone . when one of the first smartwatches came to market , the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem . we found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive . it also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone . surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches . they were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count . we also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the `` phantom device effect . '' they would compulsive check their watch not just for the time , but for a wide range of information . in some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist . some would feel a phantom buzz , notifying them of an imaginary incoming email . the phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become . recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up . we also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events . we used to worry that the average american watched television for six hours a day . now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we 're awake . indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep . this raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives . in the work carl cederström and i have done on the hidden dangers of wearables , a big big concern is privacy . the apple watch , like most wearables , is essentially a tracking device , recording heart rate , sleep patterns , movement , whereabouts , and much more depending on the apps installed . all this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis . the result ? a database of personal information of which the stasi could only have dreamed . as well as sucking up personal information , wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness . by pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop , we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms . data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace , making people not just health conscious , but also self-obsessed . instead of checking in with social networks , we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms . as a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world . as we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we 're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past . not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry . as a result , we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves , giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy . if apple 's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches , it 's likely to create a step change in our lives . we already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago . widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails , people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream , planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings . rather than talking about what was on television last night , people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns . when this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived . read : will your apple watch program you ? copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the march toward publication of another book by the reclusive `` to kill a mockingbird '' author continues forward . many people who know her have raised questions about 88-year-old harper lee 's ability to consent to publish another book , while others have said she knows what she 's doing , according to a new york times report . alabama officials have found lee wants to publish the book . since lee wrote `` to kill a mockingbird '' in 1960 , she had steadfastly refused to publish another book . lee now lives in an assisted living facility in monroeville , alabama , and some friends say her forgetfulness makes her unable to knowingly consent to publishing the book , `` go set a watchman . '' after receiving an anonymous complaint of elder abuse about lee , the state of alabama sent investigators from the alabama securities commission to talk to her and others around her . `` it was clear to our investigators that she fully understood the questions that were being asked , that she indicated she certainly wanted her book published , and she had her opinions that were voiced during the interview , '' joseph borg , the agency 's director , told cnn . `` and at that point we decided that she certainly knew what was going on . '' lee wrote `` go set a watchman '' before `` to kill a mockingbird , '' and it features some of the same characters . lee lawyer tonja b. carter found the `` go set a watchman '' draft in the author 's belongings in august and negotiated a publishing deal with harpercollins . for now , `` go set a watchman '' is still scheduled to be released by harpercollins in july . the securities commission investigation is closed . `` should something come up a later date that shows something was wrong , which we have no indication of , we could take another look , '' borg said . `` but since we had no complaint from the person who in the middle of it all , so there was no reason to maintain the case open . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the state department only last month started automatically preserving dozens of high-level officials ' emails , according to a department spokeswoman , a revelation that comes amid the controversy surrounding former secretary of state hillary clinton 's own email use . this is key because clinton , in her news conference on tuesday to answer questions about why she exclusively used a private email address to communicate during her tenure , told reporters she 'd thought her communications to senior department officials were always saved . that 's an important point , given legal requirements for preserving federal records . `` in meeting the record-keeping obligations , it was my practice to email government officials on their state or dot-gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved , '' she said . the news about the state department 's archiving practices -- and the change that started in february -- could refuel the furor of republicans over clinton 's choice to not use her government email account , to have a private server in her family home house her emails , and to decide -lrb- with her staff -rrb- which emails to delete and which to turn over to the state department for review . rep. susan brooks , a member of the select committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attack , said in the republicans ' weekly media address saturday , `` you see , right now there is no way for us to know whether we have all of the state department communications that rightfully belong to the american people . '' `` the only way to truly know is by having access to secretary clinton 's personal server , '' the indiana republican added . `` we are asking secretary clinton to turn her server over to a neutral , third-party arbiter . after a complete inventory , this arbiter can make a determination as to which emails should be public and which should remain private . these decisions would be completely impartial and independent . '' so far , brooks ' committee had gotten just under 300 of clinton 's emails from the state department . last year , as it was trying to update its records , the state department asked former secretaries of state for nonpersonal emails from their personal accounts that could be work-related . that request prompted clinton to turn over 30,490 emails -- about 55,000 pages . clinton has asked for those emails to be made public , and department officials are reviewing them to make sure no sensitive information is released . clinton 's office had said her account contained 62,320 sent and received emails from march 2009 to february 2013 . `` about half were personal that were not in any way related to work . i had no reason to save them , '' clinton said at her press conference . the fact that all emails from senior officials were n't automatically saved until recently does n't mean they are gone , according to the state department . `` i would n't state it 's lost to history , because there are always -- there are technical means of gaining access to past information , '' spokeswoman jen psaki said friday . at the same time , psaki said the state department chose to change its approach -- by automatically saving all emails -- `` because it 's an imperfect system . '' `` this is a more efficient and better way , '' she said of the new system . `` but , obviously , there were ways to preserve -lrb- emails -rrb- , and employees and individuals were expected to do that prior to this new process . '' separately , psaki said that a letter was recently sent to former state department staffers asking for their help in the preservation effort . `` if they should become aware ... of federal record in their possession -- such as an email sent or received on a personal email account while -lrb- they were -rrb- serving in their official capacity at the department -- that ... record -lrb- should -rrb- be made available to the department , '' psaki said the ex-staffers were told . even before last month 's chance , emails of current secretary of state john kerry , who uses a government address , were already being saved automatically . cnn 's adam levine contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- america may be growing less hateful . that 's according to an annual southern poverty law center report that says the number of hate groups in the united states remains on the decline for the second year in a row . in the `` intelligence report '' released tuesday , the splc says the number of hate groups operating in the u.s. declined 17 % between 2013 and 2014 . they are now at their lowest levels since 2005 , the watchdog organization said . `` patriot groups , which are animated by a series of conspiracy theories about the alleged evils of the federal government , fell even faster , to 874 groups from a 2012 peak of 1,360 groups . in just the last year , the number of patriot groups declined by 20 % , from 1,096 groups to 874 , '' the report said . `` but those numbers may be somewhat deceiving . more than half of the decline in hate groups was of ku klux klan chapters , and many of those have apparently gone underground , ending public communications , rather than disbanding . '' the decline may be due to a number of factors , including the rebounding economy , law enforcement action and leadership issues within the groups , the splc said . the `` high social '' cost of being associated publicly with a hate group is also noted as a factor for decline , the group said . `` the atmosphere has changed , '' mark potok , editor-in-chief of the `` intelligence report , '' told reporters on a conference call . `` overall , the groups are less important . '' people publishing messages of hate directly to the internet is also cited as a possible reason for the decline in the organized groups . california and florida have the largest number of hate groups , with more than 50 each . alaska and hawaii are the only states with no hate groups , according to the splc . the report tracks the number of chapters or groups , not individual members , so while the number of groups is on the decline , it 's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership . the ku klux klan experienced the largest decline of all hate groups , according to the report , losing more than 50 % of its chapters . one of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the united states , the kkk took its foothold after the civil war , terrorizing the african-american population with intimidation and violent actions , including lynching . the klan 's growth slowed after the establishment of jim crow laws in the american south , according to the splc . the kkk 's last resurgence came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s . the group was again responsible for large-scale terror against the south 's african-american population . in 1990 , the splc started to keep track of the number of kkk chapters , which reached a high of 221 in 2010 , in response to president barack obama 's election , according to the report . since then , the numbers have been on the decline . the splc now reports 72 chapters , down from 163 a year ago . under obama , 4 in 10 say race relations worsened . the reason for the decline of the ku klux klan is not totally clear , though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground . `` it appears that most of the groups simply faded as their leaders and members got older , but it is also very possible that many simply stopped announcing where their chapters were , '' the report said . the center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 people are klan members in the united states . opinion : america facing anti-muslim bigotry . the splc report also notes that more people may be operating as so-called lone wolves . the overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since . however , the number of registered users to stormfront -- a website claiming to be `` the voice of the new , embattled white minority ! '' -- has doubled since 2008 . it now has nearly 300,000 users . lone wolves are a concern , the report said , because 90 % of all domestic terror attacks since 2009 were carried out by individuals or pairs . lone wolf planned attack on u.s. capitol , fbi says . the report points to neo-nazi frazier glenn miller , who allegedly killed three people in kansas who he thought were jewish , and an incident in las vegas , where an anti-government couple killed two police officers before being killed themselves , as examples of radical criminal elements acting alone . the splc refers to this and other indicators to say that many individuals may be moving from organized groups to the internet , to become more anonymous . looking towards next year , splc is `` expecting a real wave of islamophobia '' because of the proliferation of isis and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group , potok told reporters .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` cinderella , '' the latest live-action retelling of a classic , sparkled like a glass slipper in its opening weekend , with an estimated debut of $ 70.1 million . that 's well above expectations of $ 50 to 60 million , and it tops last year 's $ 69.4 million opening for `` maleficent , '' another take on the classic fairy tale , which featured angelina jolie and a darker tone . this version , however is sweetness and light , thanks to veteran director kenneth branagh . small-screen stars lily james -lrb- `` downton abbey '' -rrb- and richard madden -lrb- `` game of thrones '' -rrb- play ella and her prince , who overcome personal grief and uncertainty with courage and goodness . oscar winner cate blanchett provides venom as the wicked stepmother . reviews for `` cinderella '' have been strong , with a current rotten tomatoes rating of 83 % . disney timed the release well : it 's been more than a month since a family film hit theaters -lrb- if you can call the `` spongebob '' sequel a `` family '' film -rrb- , and some american school districts just began spring break . liam neeson 's latest thriller , `` run all night , '' opened in a very soft second place . neeson has been a solid draw since he reinvented himself as an action star six years ago with `` taken , '' but `` run all night '' debuted even more weakly than last year 's dismal `` a walk among the tombstones . '' this time out , he plays a former hit man whose family is targeted by his old boss , played by ed harris -- but it seems people would rather see neeson attack and fight than run . in limited release , the critically acclaimed horror thriller `` it follows '' made $ 163,000 in just four theaters , far and away the weekend 's best per-theater average . among returning films , colin firth and `` kingsman : the secret service '' shone the brightest , topping the $ 100 million mark in total domestic grosses and actually rising a spot on the chart , while last weekend 's winner , `` chappie , '' and runner-up , `` focus , '' duked it out for fourth place . next weekend , shailene woodley returns in the young adult action sequel `` the divergent series : insurgent , '' while sean penn tries the action genre with idris elba and javier bardem in `` the gunman .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- two more american aid workers who had high-risk exposure to ebola in sierra leone arrived back in the united states on monday for monitoring . neither is sick or known to be infected with the disease . eight of their colleagues have already been flown back to the united states , where health authorities are watching them closely for signs of the disease , according to the centers for disease control and prevention . the returning workers are clinicians for partners in health , a boston-based aid group . they all had contact with a colleague who 's been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the national institutes of health in bethesda , maryland . the heath care worker with ebola was in critical condition monday , the nih said . that changed from the nih saying on friday that the patient was in serious condition . details about the patient 's identity were n't released . while in west africa , the workers `` came to the aid of their ailing colleague , '' according to a partners in health statement . as the cdc investigates who else might have had contact with the ebola patient , more workers might be flown back to the united states , according to tom skinner , a spokesman for the cdc . the workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating ebola patients , and if they show signs of the disease , they 'll be admitted as patients -- as was the case with one worker in nebraska . the person developed symptoms sunday evening and `` out of an abundance of caution '' was taken to the biocontainment unit at the university of nebraska medical center in omaha . `` at this point , this person has not tested positive for the ebola virus , '' phil smith , m.d. , medical director of the unit , said in a statement monday . `` however , because of a change in symptoms , we decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the individual to the biocontainment unit , where we can better monitor symptoms and safely perform testing . however , some of the symptoms which prompted the move to the biocontainment unit have resolved this morning . '' none of the other aid workers are showing symptoms of ebola . nurse who contracted ebola sues hospital company . state health authorities say all 10 of the workers are deemed to have had high-risk exposure to ebola . this includes people who were not wearing protective gear and were exposed to the bodily fluids of someone with ebola while that person was symptomatic , or someone who lived in the same household and provided direct care to a symptomatic ebola patient . the first of these workers arrived friday night in atlanta showing possible signs of ebola , but testing over the weekend came back negative , according to a government official who did not want to be named . the worker is being isolated in housing near emory university hospital for 21 days . `` twice a day , we 'll have visual monitoring , either face to face or we 'll skype with them , or do facetime , '' said nancy nydam , spokeswoman for the georgia department of public health . `` and if it 's skype or facetime , they 'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they 're supposed to be . '' the next set of aid workers returned back to the united states on saturday evening and went into isolation in housing on the campus of the university of nebraska medical center , according to spokesman taylor wilson . as in atlanta , these workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing . `` they will be monitored so they 'll stay there , '' wilson said . another set of three workers arrived sunday morning at housing near the national institutes of health . these workers will have more freedom to move around than the ones in georgia and nebraska . according to christopher garrett , a spokesman for the maryland department of health , his state will follow the cdc 's guidelines , which forbid monitored individuals from getting on public transportation but allow them to go outside as long as they stay at least 3 feet away from other people . ' 1686 : that 's my number ' two more workers arrived monday morning in atlanta and were isolated in housing near emory . a third worker was expected to arrive monday in atlanta , but health authorities deemed this person to be lower risk and allowed for monitoring at home , according to a government official . the patient now at nih is the second with ebola admitted to the nih hospital . safety at ebola funerals . nina pham , a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital dallas , was admitted to nih in october after she contracted the disease while treating liberian national thomas eric duncan . pham recovered and was released free of disease . duncan died . emory , the nih and nebraska are three of only four hospitals in the united states that have biocontainment units to deal with a highly infectious disease such as ebola . more than 10,000 people have died in a west african epidemic of ebola that dates back to december 2013 , according to the world health organization . almost all of the deaths have been in guinea , liberia and sierra leone . ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person . cnn 's carma hassan , joe sutton and eliott c. mclaughlin contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- police raided millionaire heir robert durst 's home in houston , texas , on tuesday , a day after he was charged with first-degree murder . dick deguerin , durst 's attorney , confirmed that investigators were searching the home . it was not immediately clear what they were looking for inside durst 's 14th-floor condo , where he has lived for many years , cnn affiliate ktrk reported . the raid comes days after fbi agents arrested durst in a new orleans hotel . the los angeles county district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against him on monday , accusing durst of shooting and killing his close friend susan berman in december 2000 . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . `` i think it 's ridiculous for them to be making a search 15 years after susan berman was killed , and they 're searching a place in houston , '' deguerin told cnn . durst remains jailed in new orleans , where he 's facing drug and weapons charges stemming from his arrest over the weekend . durst 's alleged connections with berman 's death and two others were the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary , `` the jinx . '' deguerin has claimed it 's no coincidence authorities moved in to arrest durst just as the documentary 's finale was about to air . and on tuesday , he said he was n't surprised about the houston raid either . `` i 'm not surprised they 're acting like a bunch of keystone cops , particularly after being embarrassed by the tv program , '' he said . `` and i 'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever . '' prosecutors accuse durst of `` lying in wait '' and killing berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she was a witness to a crime . she was shot in the head shortly before investigators were coming to speak with her about the disappearance of durst 's first wife in 1982 . durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance , though some have questioned whether comments he made at the end of the documentary -- muttering under his breath in the bathroom that he `` killed them all '' -- could be interpreted as a confession . deguerin told reporters monday that his client did n't kill berman . `` he 's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial , '' deguerin said . but it 's unclear when a trial could take place . durst waived his right to fight extradition to los angeles , but because prosecutors in new orleans are pursuing charges against him , he remains jailed there . durst had a smith & wesson .38 - caliber revolver on him when he was arrested , according to new orleans police department records . investigators found marijuana and a `` substantial '' amount of cash in durst 's hotel room , a source familiar with the investigation told cnn . he was booked in new orleans monday on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm with a controlled substance . he may be moved soon to a different louisiana prison where inmates with `` an acute medical condition '' are sent , deguerin said . court documents filed tuesday say durst will receive medications while imprisoned , `` including but not limited to hydrocodone as needed for pain .

ferguson , missouri -lrb- cnn -rrb- loistine hoskin cared for her old car as a sentimental possession , missing a tire while parked beside her home , until one day the city ticketed her for having a `` derelict vehicle in driveway . '' a tow truck took it away in 2009 . so began an odyssey with ferguson police , municipal court and city hall that left her with $ 1,200 in fines that to this day she still does n't fully understand . she paid the sum because endless court hearings about the car wore her down . `` i do n't have a lawyer . i 'm not a lawyer . it 's me going up against the city of ferguson when the attorneys wo n't help , '' hoskin said this week . she never saw again her 1996 oldsmobile ninety-eight with 168,000 miles . its location is a mystery . she accepts the loss because at least she 's not in jail , where city authorities threatened to put her at one point , she said . while hoskin 's surrender of both car and $ 1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice , the u.s. justice department revealed this week a `` pattern and practice '' of racial discrimination within ferguson that may lend credibility to hoskin 's account of a government run amok . just about every branch of ferguson government -- police , municipal court , city hall -- participated in `` unlawful '' targeting of african-american residents such as hoskin for tickets and fines , the justice department concluded this week . the millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying `` revenue rather than public safety needs , '' the justice department found . to the outside world , the federal findings were staggering , but to hoskin and other longtime residents , the conclusion was nothing new . they 've felt it all along , they say . it 's only now that federal authorities have documented the institutionalized racism , as part of a civil rights investigation after a white police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen , michael brown , 19 , last summer . the officer , darren wilson , was cleared of federal civil rights violations this week and was earlier cleared of criminal wrongdoing . the justice department is expected to pursue a court-supervised consent decree that requires the city of ferguson to make changes to its police and courts . `` it 's definitely a vicious cycle , '' said hoskin , 64 , a retired airline reservation agent . `` unfortunately for most people who are in this cycle , they continue to be in a downward spiral because they ca n't get jobs , they ca n't do anything , they ca n't pay the fines . '' hoskin 's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with ferguson police , the family said . hoskin 's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling , she said . in 2007 , kimberly hoskin got a $ 124 ticket for driving her sister 's car , which was n't insured in missouri , and then had to pay an additional $ 100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency appendectomy . the court , she said , rejected her medical excuse and issued a warrant for her arrest . she paid a total of $ 224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and did n't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job . `` why is it that all the people in court are black ? '' kimberly hoskin said of defendants in municipal court . `` i 've had so many police officers make a u-turn , follow me , run my plates , find out everything is ok , then turn around and go back in the direction they were going . `` there 's nothing we can do . in ferguson , the police do what they want to do . ferguson does what it wants , '' said kimberly hoskin , 35 , who now works the overnight shift on a general motors manufacturing line . city officials and police declined to respond to cnn 's requests this week for comment about the hoskin family 's assertions . last september , the city council repealed administrative fees imposed by police when overseeing the release of a towed vehicle , the mayor said . the city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court , which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs , the mayor said . the justice department 's report details how ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining . ferguson 's budget increases were so sizable that city officials exhorted police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators , who turned out to be largely african-american , the justice department said . the demands for revenue were so intense that the police department had `` little concern with how officers do this , '' even disciplining officers who failed to issue an average of 28 tickets a month , the justice department report said . officers competed `` to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop , '' the justice department said . one apparent winner was an officer who issued 14 tickets at a single encounter , according to the federal investigation report . many police stops of civilians `` have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law , '' the report said . ferguson police chief mum on federal report . indeed , ferguson enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said . when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million in 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : `` awesome ! thanks ! '' according to the federal report . even municipal judges were pressured to boost revenue . `` the city has made clear to the police chief and the municipal judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations , '' the federal investigation found . the city finance director said in a 2011 report that the municipal judge had been successful since 2003 in increasing court collections , and that internal 2011 city report noted a judge 's statement that `` none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the court clerk , the chief of police , and the prosecutor 's office , '' the justice department investigation found . cash filled the city treasury . by 2013 , revenue from enforcing municipal codes reached $ 2.46 million , the federal report said . by 2015 , the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23 % of the budget , or $ 3.09 million of $ 13.26 million in general fund expenses , the justice department found . just five years earlier , court fines and fees made up only 12 % of the budget , or $ 1.38 million of $ 11.07 million in general fund revenues , the justice department found . the fines were among the highest of surrounding municipalities . for example , area parking fines ranged from $ 5 to $ 100 , but ferguson 's parking fine was $ 102 . a fine for `` weeds/tall grass '' was $ 5 in one nearby city , but ferguson 's fine ranged from $ 77 to $ 102 , the justice department found . the federal government made a forceful conclusion : . `` city , police and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process , beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established , '' the federal report said . after the justice department 's announcement this week , ferguson mayor james knowles told reporters that he , police chief tom jackson and city attorney stephanie karr met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives , including reforms to the municipal court . knowles said municipal judges have created a docket for alleged offenders having trouble paying fines . also , a defendant may ask a judge or prosecutor about different payment plans or alternative sentencing , the mayor said . defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once , regardless of ability to pay , the federal report said . the city also passed an ordinance last september to cap municipal court revenues at 15 % of the city 's overall budget , the mayor said . that figure is half missouri 's legal limit , he added . all the reforms are intended to `` move this city , its residents and our entire community forward , '' the mayor said . back at her home , loistine hoskin recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city , which occurred shortly after her husband , calvin , died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier . she had been his caregiver . she appeared in court to appeal the citation , but an officer arrested her and put her in the back of the squad car . her offense ? failing to appear in court , she said . she spent four hours in jail . she insists she made every court date . for now , she lives in fear of the police , even at home . `` we just got to a point where we said we 're just not going to have anyone over -- because they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket , and they did n't even live here , '' hoskin said . cnn 's ed lavandera and tristan smith contributed from ferguson . michael martinez reported and wrote this story from los angeles .
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- russian president vladimir putin appeared in a series of photos released by the kremlin on friday after a week in which canceled engagements led to speculation over his health . the three images showed putin meeting with the head of the supreme court in moscow on friday , the kremlin said . state broadcaster russia 24 also aired video footage of the meeting . cnn can not independently confirm that the meeting took place as stated . presidential spokesman dmitry peskov sought to quell the rumors of ill health on thursday , joking that they were down to `` spring fever , '' russia 's state-run tass news agency reported . `` when the sun comes up in spring , and as soon as spring is in the air , then the fever begins , '' peskov said . `` someone dreams of -lrb- rosneft ceo igor -rrb- sechin resignation , others -- of government resignation , while others have not seen president putin on tv for several days , '' he said , according to tass . `` we are calm on this fever , and respond to the questions with patience , '' peskov said . speaking to russian radio station echo of moscow , peskov also urged people not to worry , saying that putin was `` absolutely '' healthy . asked if the president 's handshake was firm , he replied that putin `` can break a hand . '' last fall , rumors also circulated about the health of north korea 's leader , kim jong un , after he was absent from the public eye for more than a month . he eventually reappeared , with north korean state media releasing photographs of him walking with a cane . the speculation about putin began after a planned meeting in the kazakh capital , astana , between the russian leader and the presidents of kazakhstan and belarus was postponed at short notice . peskov confirmed wednesday that the leaders had agreed to delay it for several days but did not give a new date , tass said . the kremlin press office said friday that putin would meet monday with his kyrgyz counterpart , almazbek atambayev , in the russian city of st. petersburg , tass said . putin 's last public appearance was sunday , on international women 's day . since then , he has had a number of meetings , but no video was released , only stills uploaded to the kremlin 's website . in the course of his many years in power , putin has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader . his exploits , captured on film and released to the media , have included riding horses while shirtless , exploring the seafloor in a submersible , handling a tranquilized tiger and , just last year , earning a karate black belt . the russian president has been in the international spotlight in recent months after moscow 's intervention in ukraine , which has prompted heightened tensions with the west . opinion : why has putin gone missing ? cnn 's alla eshchenko reported from moscow , and laura smith-spark wrote and reported from london .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a crowd of tens of thousands filled yitzhak rabin square in tel aviv on saturday evening , calling for a change in israeli leadership amid growing discontent with the current administration . the rally , called `` israel wants change , '' was put on by one million hands , a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues : a two-state solution and a reduction in the cost of living . on both of these topics , founder dror ben-ami says , prime minister benjamin netanyahu has failed . `` we think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office . to get bibi out of office , '' says ben-ami . organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the march 17 balloting . instead , they are encouraging voters to change the current administration . police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people . headlining the rally was meir dagan , the former head of mossad , israel 's spy agency , and a vocal critic of netanyahu . in recent weeks , dagan criticized netanyahu 's decision to speak before the u.s. congress , and he continued his criticism at the rally , saying that he has never seen such stagnation in israeli politics . netanyahu still has broad support in israel , and his likud party is doing well in the polls . the zionist union is likud 's primary challenger . in the initial round of polling immediately following netanyahu 's speech before congress , the zionist union was expected to win 24 seats in the knesset while likud was expected to win 23 seats . the poll comes from cnn affiliate channel 2 israel . because of the nature of israeli politics , netanyahu 's likud party could lose the election while netanyahu still becomes prime minister . in many ways , this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011 . hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of tel aviv , demanding improvements in the cost of housing , education , and health care . what started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities . this time , the issues are different . but the growing sense of discontent and the calls for change remain .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a u.s. air force veteran who allegedly tried to join isis in syria but was turned back by turkish authorities before he could get to the war-torn country entered a not guilty plea to terror-related charges wednesday in a federal court in new york . tairod nathan webster pugh , accused of making the foiled attempt in january , was indicted by a grand jury on charges of trying to give material support to the terror group and obstruction of justice , the u.s. justice department said in a two-count indictment announced tuesday . among the evidence , prosecutors allege : investigators discovered on his laptop computer a letter saying he wanted to `` use the talents and skills given to me by allah to establish and defend the islamic states , '' and a chart of crossing points between turkey and syria , where isis controls some territory . who has been recruited to isis from the west ? pugh , a 47-year-old convert to islam and a former new jersey resident who served in the air force from 1986 to 1990 , was arrested upon his return to the united states in january , the justice department said . `` pugh , an american citizen and former member of our military , allegedly abandoned his allegiance to the united states and sought to provide material support to isil , '' assistant u.s. attorney general john carlin said , using an alternate acronym for the islamist terror group that controls territory in parts of iraq and syria . at his arraignment wednesday in u.s. district court in brooklyn , pugh appeared in a black t-shirt and khaki pants and stated his name . he pleaded not guilty through his attorney , michael schneider . the defendant , a former avionics instrument system specialist in the air force , flew from egypt to turkey on january 10 , weeks after being fired from a middle east-based job as an airplane mechanic , u.s. authorities allege . why is isis so successful at luring westerners ? but turkey denied him entry . in the indictment , u.s. authorities said turkey was likely suspicious pugh was headed for syria . instead turkish officials sent him on a return flight to egypt , where he was detained . in egypt , he was carrying multiple electronic devices , `` including four usb thumb drives that had been stripped of their plastic casings and an ipod that had been wiped clean of data , '' the justice department said in a statement . pugh had purposefully tampered with the devices to prevent others from getting access to his electronic media , the indictment said . pugh was deported to the united states , where agents with the fbi 's joint terrorism task force obtained a warrant for his devices , including the laptop , the department said . investigators found a letter from january addressed to a misha , whom they believe is his wife , authorities said . in it , the writer says : `` i am a -lrb- mujahedeen -rrb- . i am a sword against the oppressor and a shield for the oppressed . i will use the talents and skills given to me by allah to establish and defend the islamic states . '' in addition to that letter and the turkey/syria border chart , agents also found recent internet searches for information on `` borders controlled by islamic state , '' as well as `` internet searches for ` flames of war , ' an isil propaganda video , '' and `` downloaded videos , including one showing isil members executing prisoners , '' the justice department said . they also found what the government said was another 180 jihadist propaganda videos . pugh was arrested in asbury park , new jersey , on january 16 . while in the air force , pugh was trained in installing and maintaining aircraft engine , navigation and weapons systems , the justice department said . pugh converted to islam after moving to san antonio in 1998 , according to the indictment . the indictment said he took a job as a mechanic with american airlines in or about 2001 . the airline has not responded to a request for comment . in 2001 , an american airlines co-worker alerted the fbi that pugh `` sympathized with osama bin laden , felt that the 1998 bombings of u.s. embassies overseas were justified , and expressed anti-american sentiment , '' the complaint said . one year later , an associate told the fbi that pugh had expressed interest in traveling to chechnya to `` fight jihad . '' from october 2009 to march 2010 , he worked in iraq as an army contractor for dyncorp , according to the complaint . according to pugh 's linkedin page , he listed himself as a maintenance manager for gryphon airlines , a kuwait-based charter airline , since september 2014 . but the airline told cnn that pugh was only under consideration to work for it in 2014 . `` in third quarter 2014 , mr. pugh was under consideration for a future gryphon project , but did not meet the qualifications , '' the airline said in a statement . `` gryphon declined to hire mr. pugh . gryphon personnel are cooperating with the authorities . '' his last known u.s. address was in neptune , new jersey , but he had lived in egypt for about the last year , the indictment said . if convicted , pugh could be sentenced to up to 35 years in prison . cnn 's ray sanchez , john newsome and steve almasy contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- we have no problem taking wall street executives to task for decisions that leave american families financially devastated , yet we give silicon valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing . america needs to realize that instead of creating jobs , silicon valley is erasing them , leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground . silicon valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday 's laptop . the commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education , a young person in america can get a good job . but despite falling unemployment , college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low-paying jobs that do n't even require a college degree . the percentage of young people languishing in low-skill , low-paying jobs is 44 % , a 20-year high . only 36 % of college grads have jobs that pay at least $ 45,000 , a sharp decline from the 1990s , after adjusting for inflation . perhaps most depressingly , the percentage of young people making below $ 25,000 has topped 20 % , worse than in 1990 . in other words , those with a bachelor 's diploma were better off before the digital revolution . if this comes as a surprise , that 's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude . in our collective imagination , millennials are saying , `` no jobs ? that 's ok -- i 'll create my own ! '' and then they solve their own problems by heading to silicon valley with little more than an iphone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires . a fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be mike bean , founder of internet behemoth gryzzl on the show `` parks and recreation . '' played by blake anderson , bean might best be described as `` barefoot and pregnant with ideas . '' the bumbling entrepreneur conquers the world practically by accident , armed only with his digital savvy , a can-do spirit , and a penchant for invading users ' privacy . you get the idea that his success came easily . privacy concerns aside , the mike beans of america are just about as rare as the mark zuckerbergs . in fact , the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24-year low . garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups . but wait -- wo n't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs ? after a period of adjustment , wo n't things get better ? unfortunately that 's not the path we 're on . one of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology , there 's a new , equally good -lrb- or better -rrb- job created by silicon valley . but exactly the opposite is happening . the digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs : minimum wage jobs -lrb- think amazon warehouse employees -rrb- and so-called `` sharing-economy jobs '' -lrb- think uber drivers -rrb- . the sharing-economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers . sharing economy jobs are n't really jobs at all ; they 're freelance gigs . sure , silicon valley does n't owe america jobs . but something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages , decreased worker protection and zero job security . this `` winner-take-all '' digital economy is not sustainable . people on both sides of the political spectrum are worried . liberal luminary robert reich , a professor at the university of california at berkeley and former secretary of labor under bill clinton , calls the sharing economy the `` share-the-scraps '' economy . speaking of tech companies that utilize on-demand labor , such as uber , instacart and taskrabbit , he says , `` the big money goes to the corporations that own the software . the scraps go to the on-demand workers . '' meanwhile , conservative columnist ross douthat fears a dystopian future in which `` a rich , technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents . '' put simply , silicon valley 's utopia is the rest of america 's dystopia . and those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates , whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback . and if you think your own job is safe , think again . new research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades . this is a giant leap backward , but it 's deceptively described as technological `` progress . '' as anyone who 's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest , `` automated '' usually means `` worse . '' what can be done ? how can we fight this slide back toward the middle ages ? if we take no action , we 're headed toward a kind of digital world feudalism where there are a handful of kings , a lot of peasants and no middle class . there 's no easy fix , but we can do three things immediately . first , we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about silicon valley 's questionable tactics and its real job creation record -lrb- i.e. , just follow the numbers -rrb- . second , we can encourage more lawsuits against the abusive practices of `` sharing-economy '' powerhouses . third , we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding silicon valley accountable for their power over the entire american workforce , including white-collar employees . the fictional gryzzl 's tagline borrows some millennial slang : `` would n't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other ? '' indeed it would . and if we want a better future for millennials and the generations after them , we need to challenge the prevailing silicon valley ethos before it 's too late .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the uk 's metropolitan police has summoned five football fans to answer allegations of racism . it relates to an incident captured on camera , prior to chelsea 's european champions league match with paris saint-germain last month . in the french capital before the match an apparent group of chelsea fans are caught on camera , appearing to prevent a black man boarding the paris metro . the video , widely shared on social media , also depicted the group of men chanting : `` we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' the man in the video was blocked several times from boarding the train and shoved off at least twice . he was later identified as souleymane s , a 33-year-old parisian on his way home from work . london 's met police had appealed for help to identify those responsible but in a statement released wednesday , said five men were due in court later this month . it read : `` on 10 march and 11 march , the metropolitan police service served summonses on five men involved in incidents on the paris metro before the paris saint-germain v chelsea champions league fixture on tuesday 17 february . `` they have been summonsed to appear at waltham forest magistrates ' court on wednesday , 25 march regarding a police application for football banning orders . '' the authorities have not identified any of the alleged perpetrators . chelsea were quick to condemn the group , saying in a statement after the incident that the chanting was `` abhorrent '' and something that `` has no place in football or society . '' manager jose mourinho said he was `` ashamed '' by the flashpoint , while the club moved quickly to suspend the five men involved . it said they faced a life ban should they be found guilty . `` i watched the image the next day , i did n't want to watch again , i watched only once , '' mourinho told reporters a few days after the match in paris . `` it is enough for me , it is sad enough for me . it is a humiliation for that gentleman , i imagine myself in that same situation , i want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport . '' a club spokesperson also confirmed that chelsea 's russian owner roman abramovich was `` disgusted '' by the incident whilst french president francois hollande personally spoke to souleymane . chelsea invited him to attend the return fixture at stamford bridge but he declined the offer . `` i wo n't go , '' he was quoted as saying by french radio station rtl . `` they ca n't buy me with a little piece of paper . i 'm not a child . `` i do n't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me . i still hear the voices of those people who pushed me because of the color of my skin . '' football banning orders can last for between three and ten years , and any breach can result in a criminal offense , with a prison sentence of up to six months .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- former manchester united star danny welbeck returned to haunt his old side to send holders arsenal into the semifinals of the fa cup with a 2-1 victory at old trafford monday . the england striker was surplus to requirements at louis van gaal 's united , but was quick to capitalize on a mistake by antonio valencia to grab the winner just after the hour mark . a disappointing night for united was compounded by a late red card for argentina international angel di maria , who was given his marching orders after manhandling referee michael oliver . di maria was initially booked for simulation and took his protests too far by grabbing the official , which led to his instant dismissal . with 10 men , united was never able to exert any real pressure on arsenal and it took two fine saves david de gea to deny further goals from santi cazorla and alexis sanchez for the away side . victory for arsenal booked a return to wembley for a last four clash with either reading or bradford city , who are replaying their quarterfinal tie next monday . liverpool or blackburn rovers will play aston villa in the other semifinal . arsenal had taken a 25th minute lead through nacho monreal , the spanish defender converting after fine move which involved mesut ozil and alex oxlade-chamberlain . but the advantage was short lived with di maria finding wayne rooney to score with a diving header . united looked to press ahead for the winner , but home hopes were dashed when valencia made a hash of a back pass and welbeck was quick to latch on to the loose ball and beat de gea . ' i believe it was justice for him to score he worked extremely hard today , ' arsenal manager arsene wenger said of welbeck . his counterpart van gaal will now , barring a miracle , be left without a trophy in his first season in charge of the english powerhouses , with the pressure now on to seal a top four place in the epl to guarantee champions league football next season .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- thiago silva 's path to redemption took a mere 12 minutes . for that short period of time the brazilian must have been panicking that his needless error had cost his paris saint-germain side a place in the last eight of the european champions league . his handball had gifted english premier league leaders chelsea a 2-1 aggregate advantage in extra time , but this was one tale that would be adorned with a silva lining . seconds after being denied by a world class save from thibaut courtois , silva looped a header into the net to send psg through on away goals . not only did he save himself from a barrage of criticism , he also got colleague zlatan ibrahimovic out of jail too . the maverick swedish striker 's dismissal after 31 minutes made psg 's passage into the quarterfinals all the more remarkable , as it battled the best team in england with 10 men for an energy-sapping 90 minutes . gary cahill looked to have ended psg 's resistance with a 81st minute goal before former chelsea defender david luiz equalized with four minutes left . eden hazard converted from the spot in extra time after silva 's misdemeanor before the 30-year-old popped up at the death to make amends and avenge psg 's defeat at the same stage by chelsea last season . `` we played a great game , '' luiz told sky sports . `` it was amazing tonight , the spirit , the players gave everything . when we lost ibra we said we had to keep it simple and keep the ball . `` it 's amazing for the club and the city . we tried to win the game even with one less man . we have a long way to go to win the champions league and we keep our feet on the floor . '' the first tie ended 1-1 in paris three weeks ago but most of the headlines related to an ugly incident of racism on the city 's metro system . a group of supporters , apparently chelsea fans , were caught on camera appearing to prevent a black man from boarding a train before chanting : `` we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' the uk 's metropolitan police announced on wednesday that it had summoned five men to appear in court later in march , while chelsea has vowed to ban for life any of its fans that are found guilty . the club extended an invitation to the man who was the the subject of the abuse , known as souleymane s , but the 33-year-old refused . the opening stages were tense and feisty , just as they were in the french capital during the first leg , but the match in london ignited after a flashpoint just past the half hour mark . ibrahimovic , so often the hero for psg , turned villain after being dismissed for a forceful tackle on chelsea 's brazilian playmaker oscar . the home side surrounded referee bjorn kuipers who duly produced a red card -- the fourth of the swede 's often controversial career in the champions league . but replays suggested the 33-year-old was perhaps unfortunate to see red , having tried to pull out of the tackle at the last second . despite having a man advantage , chelsea struggled to create clear cut openings as psg defended resolutely . kuipers was in the spotlight again as the half came to a close -- a mazy run from striker diego costa ended when he was felled by psg 's uruguayan forward edinson cavani . the referee took a long look at the incident but decided to wave play on , much to the chagrin of chelsea 's players and manager jose mourinho . mourinho 's travails continued after the break as the blues toiled in its attempts to open up a determined psg rearguard . a half chance for gary cahill came and went before the visitors came to the fore . first cavani played in maxwell , whose ball across the face of goal was begging to be tapped in , before the uruguayan had a chance to tilt the tie firmly in his side 's favor . played in on goal by argentinian javier pastore , cavani rounded chelsea goalkeeper thibaut courtois but could only glance a shot off the near post from a tight angle . pastore then got into the area after neat approach play and , though he got a powerful low shot away , courtois was equal to it and palmed it clear . chelsea began to reassert its dominance as psg tired . substitute ramires weaved into the area and was denied by a fine save at his near post by salvatore sirigu . from the resulting corner a miskick from costa presented the ball at the feet of england defender cahill , who lashed home from 12 yards out . but chelsea were unable to hold out . luiz , who won the champions league with chelsea during a three-year stint at the club , had been booed throughout the game for a running battle with costa . and he rose highest to power a header into the net and make the tie level on aggregate with just four minutes remaining . psg began the extra half hour in sluggish fashion and were punished when silva needlessly handled a looping cross into the area as he went up to challenge substitute kurt zouma for the ball . belgium international eden hazard duly tucked the penalty away , to restore chelsea 's lead and ensure the tie would not go to penalties . still chelsea looked edgy . courtois was forced to make a world class save from silva , as the brazilian desperately tried to make amends for his handball . but despite that warning , silva netted with a fine header from the very next corner , looping a brilliant header over the goalkeeper from 14 yards out . after the game mourinho admitted psg had `` clearly '' been the better side : `` our performance was not good enough , '' he told sky sports . `` we had the game in our hands twice but i think psg were stronger than us and coped better with the pressure of the game . '' german champions bayern munich cemented its place in the last eight with a comprehensive 7-0 dismantling of shakhtar donetsk . after a 0-0 draw in the first leg in ukraine , shakhtar 's task became an uphill one inside four minutes when olexandr kucher was dismissed for bringing down mario götze inside the penalty area . thomas muller tucked home the resulting penalty , and bayern subsequently laid siege to shakhtar 's goal . robert lewandowski nodded rafinha 's cross against the post before pep guardiola 's side doubled its advantage just after the half hour mark . defender jerome boateng had the simple task of tapping home from point blank range after former dortmund striker lewandowski 's effort had been saved . bayern ran riot after the break , france international franck ribery grabbing the third with a fine low finish after a powerful run into the area . muller grabbed a second moments later before holger badstuber made it five with a thumping header . lewandowski finally got on the score sheet before götze completed the rout .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- relief workers reported `` unbelievable destruction '' after tropical cyclone pam smashed the capital of vanuatu , the australian red cross said saturday . the australian red cross said via twitter that `` humanitarian needs will be enormous . many people have lost their homes . shelter , food and water -lrb- are -rrb- urgent priorities '' in port vila . meteorologists said the storm has weakened some , but it was still pounding the islands after hours of fierce winds and torrential rain . '' #cyclonepam still tearing through #vanuatu . ` much bigger than expected , ' says our colleague in port vila . initial reports of devastation , '' the australian branch of unicef said on twitter earlier . pam , one of the strongest storms seen in the south pacific in years , earlier made a direct hit on the capital , raising fears of mass destruction . in its 8 a.m. saturday update , the vanuatu meteorological services warned of `` very destructive hurricane force winds '' of 155 mph -lrb- 250 kilometers per hour -rrb- in shefa and tafea provinces , with several others facing `` very rough to phenomenal seas with heavy swells . '' the joint typhoon warning center in pearl harbor , hawaii , said the cyclone had weakened from the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane to a category 4 . it has dumped more than 9 inches of rain on the capital in a 36-hour period and has wind gusts of up to 190 mph -lrb- 305 kph -rrb- . track the storm . pam is forecast to move southeastward along the western edge of the southern islands of vanuatu . it is n't expected to make any additional landfalls before dissipating . it will continue to weaken as it crosses cooler waters and encounters higher wind shear . pam is expected to pass east of new zealand on sunday and into monday . it could bring heavy rainfall to north island , including auckland . the capital , the biggest city in the vanuatu island chain , sits on the coastline , which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones . tropical cyclone pam is the strongest storm to make landfall since the devastating super typhoon haiyan hit the philippines in 2013 . chloe morrison , an emergency communications director for the humanitarian organization world vision , told cnn that she could see some light between her boarded-up windows but it was still hard to see the totality of the destruction outside the house where she and seven others huddled in a back room during the storm . `` seven hours hunkered down and it 's still not safe to go outside , '' she said . `` the winds are still really howling . we 're really lucky to be in a concrete house . '' part of the tin roof twisted off the house and landed by one of the windows , she said . she also noted that two trees outside did n't get uprooted , but they had not one bit of fruit or any leaves remaining . despite the `` quite terrifying ordeal , '' morrison said , their house did n't have any damage . through the night , the wind and torrential rain made it sound like an angry ocean was just outside their doors , she said . world vision , which says it 's been based in vanuatu for more than 30 years , said its emergency assessment team would head out to view the damage when it is safe . the staff helped prepare communities on the islands for the cyclone by positioning water , food , blankets , tarpaulins , and shelter , hygiene and kitchen kits in key places , it said , as well as advising on disaster preparedness . residents have been advised to seek shelter in places such as churches , universities and schools . `` the strongest thing they 've got is cement churches , '' said inga mepham , program director for care international for the vanuatu program . `` some of them do n't have that . it 's hard to find a structure that you 'd think would be able to withstand a category 5 -lrb- storm -rrb- . '' earlier , photographer michael mclennan -- who said the storm is being called the `` vanuatu monster '' -- told cnn that the `` strength of winds is incredible . '' video footage he shot earlier friday showed palm trees being whipped by wind and rain . evacuation alerts have been issued for several parts of the country . even before the sun rose saturday , vanuatu was already getting hit hard , with most communication and power cut off due to the storm . `` the wind outside is terrifying , '' michael wolfe , world vision 's national director in vanuatu , told that organization . `` i ca n't imagine what it 's like for families out there who were n't able to find safe shelter before the storm . '' the archipelago nation northeast of australia contains 83 small islands , many of which have little infrastructure and lack the strong housing structures that can endure a walloping storm . because of the tropical climate in vanuatu , some of the housing is made of lighter building materials , including straw and corrugated metals . residents prepared for the storm , boarding up windows and chopping down trees that stand close to buildings in case they could become debris or cause further damage or injury . cnn host bill weir , who was recently in vanuatu on assignment , said that while port vila has some modern development in the form of an airport , large hotels and a convention center that 's under construction , life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years . `` for search and rescue , for bringing food and supplies and medicine , it 's extremely challenging , '' he said . pam has triggered watches and warnings in the solomon islands and new zealand . cnn 's greg botelho and derek van dam contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you enjoy laughing at the england football team -- calling all germans and scots -- and you have a spare $ 900,000 , then sotheby 's has the very thing for you . the auction house is offering an untitled work by italian sculptor maurizio cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are english -- every defeat suffered by the england team between 1874 and 1998 . cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large -lrb- and it would have to be , would n't it ? -rrb- piece of black granite , meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings . the artist says of his memorial stone-style work simply : `` i guess it 's a piece which talks about pride , missed opportunities and death . '' known for his humorous and satirical art , cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2-1 loss to scotland in glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2-1 setback against romania at the 1998 world cup . since then , of course , he 'd have had a fair few more to immortalize , including the two to italy and uruguay in brazil last summer that were part of the worst-ever england display at a world cup . the artist , whose other works include la nona ora -lrb- the ninth hour -rrb- , which depicts pope john paul ii being struck down by a meteorite , first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in london in 1999 . it 's not known whether any england managers and players , past or present , came along to have a sneaky look . current england boss roy hodgson is known to be a bit of an italophile , but the former inter milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- cattelan 's work is on public exhibition at sotheby 's new bond street galleries until tuesday 10 march . it will then be offered as part of the single-owner ` bear witness ' sale .
esfahan , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- if you 're looking for the jewish community in the iranian town of esfahan , you wo n't have to search for long . the main synagogue is on palestine square , right in the heart of iran 's third largest city . there are public prayers several times a day -- sometimes with more than a hundred people in attendance . the jewish community in iran does not hide its heritage . at the synagogue , michael malakon leads the prayer service . he says he is proud of his jewish identity . and even in a country that is so hostile towards israel , malakon says he can practice freely and that he has many muslim friends . `` i hang around with all kinds of young people and i have a lot of muslim friends , '' malakon tells cnn after finishing the noon prayer on a monday . about 20 people were in attendance , usually from local businesses around the synagogue . none of them tried to hide the fact that they were jewish -- and inside the synagogue the star of david is proudly displayed in many places , alongside passages from the torah . there have been jews in iran for more than 2,500 years . many left the country after the islamic revolution in 1979 that brought ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to power . khomeini said iran wanted to destroy israel , but he also issued a fatwa , a religious decree , saying that iranian jews were different to those in israel and should be considered an integral part of the islamic republic . sion mahgrefte is the head of the jewish community in esfahan . he declined to comment directly on political matters , especially in the current heated environment , but he did say that the members of his community felt very much at home in iran . `` israel and iran are countries , '' he said . `` and we consider ourselves iranian jews , not israeli jews . so the hostilities between israel and iran do not affect us . '' there is even a jewish representative in iran 's parliament . and aside from the vibrant jewish community in esfahan -- there are 13 synagogues in the city -- there are also several orthodox cathedrals representing a sizable christian community . most of esfahan 's jews are business people . in the center of town there is a shopping mall , known to people here as the `` jewish passage '' because so many businesses are jewish-owned . when our crew arrived there they found muslim and jewish shop owners joking around . one of them is said shemyon , who owns a clothing store . his friends call him `` mordechai , '' and he showed us some hebrew prayer books he always keeps in the store . like most others , shemyon was not keen to talk about israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's recent address to u.s. congress , or the problems between israel and iran . he says those politics have no place here . `` we just want peace , '' he said . `` we really hope that all these problems can be solved one day , god willing . we are just hoping for unity and peace . '' there are about 1,500 jews in esfahan these days . the community 's leaders conduct religious studies for the younger members of the congregation . while sion mahgrefte is adamant that they have no problems with their shia neighbors , he does acknowledge that friends living abroad often worry about them . `` of course sometimes people we know who live in israel or elsewhere are very concerned about us , and they tell us we are crazy to live here , '' he says . `` but then we tell them how things are and they calm down . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- life on a civil war ship in the deep south was no pleasure cruise . heat , humidity , the rigors of military life and bouts of boredom could frustrate a fella . so it may be no surprise that among the first artifacts to be brought up from the wreck of the css georgia in savannah are two sets of leg irons . `` we all know about discipline in the navy , '' said jim jobling , a project manager with texas a&m university 's conservation research laboratory . `` it is for restricting the mobility of a prisoner who wanted to desert or had committed a crime . '' of course , the leg irons could have been used on a federal sailor or soldier taken captive . but that did n't occur with the confederate ironclad . it was scuttled in december 1864 , having never fired a shot in anger while it defended the city . about 400 artifacts have been brought up by divers in the initial stage of the recovery of the css georgia , which must be moved for a deepening of the shipping channel . `` we have scratched the surface as far as the artifacts are concerned . there are a lot more to come up , '' jobling told cnn on thursday . texas a&m is working with the u.s. army corps of engineers in savannah to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display . archaeology is n't just about cool artifacts . it 's about making a connection with the humans that used these items . and while experts have n't gleaned much about the daily life of the crew from the early dives , they have found some items that would have been used by an individual : an ironstone plate commonly used in the south , a musket trigger guard and the butt stock of a gun . visibility at the site is practically nonexistent . divers have to depend on feel to locate and remove smaller items . much of it is is detritus of the wreck : small iron plates , nails and spikes . among the items cataloged since the dives formally began at the end of january are two pieces that helped with the business end of the css georgia : its cannons . four of the artillery pieces are amid the wreckage about 40 feet down on the floor of the savannah river . one iron piece had eyes , or holes , that connected a gun carriage to ropes that the ironclad 's crew manipulated to move the gun forward and backward . another piece , a trunnion cap , helped hold the cannon to the carriage . divers and archaeologists are following a timetable and grid in the recovery , with smaller items being brought up by hand . a previous salvage effort and damage from dredging displaced some of the artifacts . other items remain right where they fell . `` someone undid the engine , moved it and was dropped '' into the depths , said jobling . contract divers are out on the site every day , weather permitting , not more than a couple miles east of the city 's famous river street and waterfront . the $ 15 million removal of the css georgia is necessary for the state and federal harbor deepening project , which will see the channel go from 42 to a uniform 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide . in june or july , u.s. navy divers are expected be on site , to bring up the larger pieces : two engines , the propeller , a steam condenser , the four guns and the casemates that housed them . one of the casemates is large : 68 feet by 24 feet . four artillery shells will be recovered , with the u.s. marine corps to render them safe for museum display . the wooden lower hull no longer exists . the css georgia did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the atlantic ocean . instead , the vessel became a stationary floating battery , bristling with artillery pieces . the yankees refused to take on the css georgia or other nearby defense obstructions . archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the css georgia through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so the remains one day can be displayed . conservation of selected artifacts and parts will be done at texas a&m and will take about two years to complete . state and local officials hope conserved pieces will be exhibited somewhere in the city . much of the css georgia is corroded , and archaeologists are gauging the integrity of each piece for conservation . but many pieces remain in pretty good shape . an x-ray of one of the leg irons shows a fair bit of corrosion . experts will inject epoxy to fill those gaps and remove any concretion on the iron , said jobling . officials need more artifacts and investigation to tell the story of the crew . `` hopefully , there is a section of the wreck that will tell the human side of the css georgia , '' said jobling . while salvage operations soon after the civil war removed a lot of iron from the site , there 's a chance personal items survive , especially if they are below the sediment line and protected from the ravages of oxygen . interestingly , the vessel 's crew had to run the main engine constantly , just to keep it afloat . why ? that 's because the css georgia 's green wood made it susceptible to leaks . so on december 21 , 1864 , just as union maj. gen. william t. sherman 's hordes of soldiers reached savannah , the ironclad 's crew likely opened its water valves . the css georgia silently slipped below the surface . the sailors used small boats to get to shore and began a 20-mile walk from savannah . `` they took what they could carry with them , '' jobling said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- vigilante motorists in new zealand have taken to snatching the car keys of foreign drivers amid rising concern over dangerous driving by tourists . new zealand media have reported five cases this year of locals forcibly taking the keys of foreign motorists after witnessing driving that concerned them . all the incidents -- which have been condemned by authorities -- took place in the south island , which draws tourists from around the world for its rugged scenery , including lakes and mountains featured in director peter jackson 's `` lord of the rings '' films . the incidents occurred amid heightened public concern over tourist driving standards , with eight people killed in crashes involving foreign drivers in the space of a fortnight last month . among the dead were a family of four from hong kong who were killed when their car crossed the center line and collided with a logging truck . the key snatchings have even prompted prime minister john key to weigh in on the issue , advising that `` people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible . '' new zealand police assistant commissioner of road policing dave cliff said the confiscations existed in a legal gray area , as there was no explicit statute dealing with the issue . although there might be exceptional circumstances where taking someone 's keys could be legally justified , such as preventing drunken driving , he said , `` in the vast majority of cases , it wo n't be . '' `` that extends to physically assaulting or abusing someone in response to their driving , which is simply not acceptable , and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences , '' he said . diesel mechanic robert penman of dunedin made headlines last month after he took the keys of a chinese couple who had stopped their car on a narrow single-lane road to take pictures , causing a backlog of vehicles behind them . `` i was coming into town with my wife and son and came around the corner , and there was a car stopped in the middle of the road , '' he told cnn affiliate tvnz . he called police and took their keys as `` a safety thing , you know , timeframe for police to get there , '' he said . the new zealand transport agency later revealed that penman was driving on an expired license himself . penman told local media it was not the first time he had taken a tourist 's car keys . only 6 % of crashes in new zealand involve foreign drivers , according to the latest figures provided by the ministry of transport . but in some remote regions of the south island particularly popular with tourists for their scenery -- such as the mackenzie , southland , queenstown-lakes and kaikoura districts -- foreign drivers are involved in about a quarter of all crashes . in westland district , on the south island 's rugged west coast , foreign drivers are involved in 37 % of road crashes resulting in death or injury . tony kokshoorn , mayor of the neighboring grey district , said tourist driving behavior was a major problem in the region and attributed the issue to tourists from countries that drive on the right . new zealanders drive on the left . `` there 's a huge number of tourists coming through to these destinations because of the scenery , but the scenery is a problem , '' he said . `` there 's so many beautiful sights to see that they 're not concentrating on their driving . once they lose their concentration , they tend to fall into old habits and drive on the right . even for 20 seconds , it can cause damage . '' a ministry of transport spokesperson said that while this was a factor , figures showed that australian and british drivers were involved in the most crashes overall , `` so unfamiliarity with which side of the road to drive on is not the only factor . '' kokshoorn said that he had seen three cases of tourists driving on the wrong side of the road recently but that the vigilante approach -- which had seen a visitor to his town punched in the face as he was stripped of his keys last month -- was `` disgraceful . '' he said the best approach was better education on local driving conditions for foreign drivers , particularly at the rental companies where they picked up their vehicles . anyone with a foreign drivers license or permit is able to drive in new zealand for up to a year . associate transport minister craig foss said the government recognized that `` many people are concerned with poor driving behavior on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations '' and had established a project in response . the measures include improvements to roading , such as `` keep left '' signage and no-passing markings on the extensive stretches of single-lane highway , and educational resources targeted at visiting drivers , including many targeting the growing chinese market . kokshoorn said it was important to `` strike the right balance '' in getting the message to foreign drivers to take care on the unfamiliar roads . `` we value tourism and the dollars it brings to new zealand , especially to our region here . we do n't want to put tourists off , but we want them to be safe in our country , '' he said . `` you cross that center line , and anything 's possible .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- are the upcoming elections in israel crucial ? will the results -- a fourth term for prime minister benjamin netanyahu or a first for opposition leader isaac herzog -- change israel 's policy in a significant way ? as israelis prepare to go to the polls , the answer seems to be negative . many observers in europe and the united states seem to be under the impression that during netanyahu 's time in power , israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that herzog , leader of the zionist union opposition party , is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity . but the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of israel and the middle east -- what to do about the palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible , a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric . while netanyahu 's insistence on israel 's continued ruling over millions of palestinians is expressed in aggressive , often religious and nationalistic language , herzog 's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the western world . but at the end of the day , neither netanyahu nor herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the palestinian territories . netanyahu says it clearly and openly ; herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it . read more : 5 key issues for next israeli leader . this whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here . the main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living , housing prices , government oversight -- but even then , slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having . but the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals , some of them concerning the behavior of netanyahu and his wife sara . there was the `` bottlegate '' affair -- claims that the wife of the prime minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence . the netanyahus say they reimbursed the government . israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward ; one that lacks internationally recognized borders ; one that has not yet decided whether it is a western society or a middle eastern one ; one that can not decide whether it wants to be religious or secular , jewish or bi-national . all of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside , ignored , covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister 's residence . there is a big elephant in the room , but israel is turning its back to it . there is a big elephant in the room , but israel believes that if nobody talks about it , the elephant does not exist . this elephant is absent from the israeli discourse on a day-to-day basis , and it is absent during elections -- a time when public discourse should be only be focused on what really matters . the elephant in the israeli room is the unending occupation of palestinian territories , and nobody is talking about it . most of the parties running in the elections have not even bothered to try to answer questions about what their plans are for the palestinians . but the occupation also continues to be a non-issue for too many ordinary israelis , who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of palestinians who live without civil rights in the west bank and who are kept under siege in gaza . for those who regard herzog and the center-left as the great hope of this campaign , it is important to remember that it was the israeli labor party who established the occupation and settlement projects in palestinian territory . golda meir , moshe dayan , shimon peres , yitzhak rabin : those labor leaders , so beloved by the west , are the founding fathers of the most significant venture of modern israel -- the illegal transfer of a jewish population to stolen land . it was a project whose purpose was to prevent any kind of equal division of the land , or a settlement with the palestinians -- and as such it has been a great success story . labor never had a real plan for the palestinians , except to time and again renew the endless peace process , which may be the longest in history . this is still true now , on the eve of elections that stand a real chance of bringing the zionist union to power . the more than 500,000 settlers in the west bank and east jerusalem have created what may be an irreversible reality , but herzog 's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table . in private circles he mentions five years as the time he needs to conclude the process . there is no better indication that herzog has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon . numerous peace plans have already been worked out in great detail ; all that is needed is for one courageous israeli leader to implement any one of them . herzog , at least at this stage , does not seem to be the one capable of doing this . on tuesday the `` only democracy in the middle east '' will elect a new parliament and a new government , in what is frequently described as a celebration of `` people power . '' but the reality is that here in israel , it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves , but for the millions of palestinians who have for nearly half a century been living under their control , directly in the west bank and indirectly in gaza . and yet , it seems , their fate is not a topic worthy of discussion . to call this a democracy in 2015 is rather problematic .

boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- eight minutes of sheer terror . that 's what police officers from watertown , massachusetts , described in heart-stopping detail monday , revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the boston marathon bombing suspects . one of the suspects , tamerlan tsarnaev , died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle , then run over by his brother , dzhokhar . dzhokhar tsarnaev managed to escape , but was later caught by police . now he 's on trial , facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others . the shootout with police in the early morning hours of april 19 , 2013 , marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the boston metropolitan area for days . it started , patrolman joseph reynolds testified , soon after he locked eyes with tamerlan tsarnaev , who he spotted driving an suv that matched a description of a stolen vehicle . reynolds called for backup . it was n't long before tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev were firing guns , throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen suv , reynolds said . `` tamerlan tsarnaev got out of the driver 's side door and began shooting at my cruiser , '' reynolds said . soon , the officer said he ran out of bullets . sgt. jeffrey pugliese saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene . `` i put my vehicle in park , i took a round through the windshield , i was sprayed with glass and i knew , ok , we were being fired on , '' said sgt. john maclellan . then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives , including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb , the officers testified . `` i noticed one was bigger than the other , and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices , '' maclellan said . `` one was throwing like a baseball . '' maclellan said the pressure cooker bomb `` was incredibly loud . i had to holster my weapon . my eyes were shaking violently in my head . i could n't see . '' pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men , tamerlan tsarnaev , charging toward him . pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer , hitting him in the bicep . pugliese tackled him . and with tamerlan tsarnaev , who was wounded from gunfire , on the ground , the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs . they thought they 'd be able to arrest him . but then something changed . `` we were wrestling with tamerlan , and all of a sudden i could hear an engine revving , '' reynolds said . the suv , reynolds said , was heading straight toward the officers . the dramatic descriptions of the shootout monday sounded like a scene from a hollywood film , said boston globe columnist kevin cullen . but the most extraordinary revelation in court , he said , was that the night could have ended very differently . `` dzhokhar tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over . he actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle . he could have sped off and run away , '' cullen told cnn 's `` the lead with jake tapper . '' he was in a much better position to flee . but apparently he decided to do a u-turn and come back . '' the sight of the stolen suv speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise . `` i reached down and i grabbed tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he would n't be hit , '' pugliese said . `` the black suv , it was right in my face . ... i kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by . '' but they did n't move tamerlan in time . his body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance , pugliese said . the prosecutor asked pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the suv driver to go directly at the officers . `` no , '' he said . `` it was accelerating at a very high rate of speed . '' later that day , tamerlan tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital , with the cause listed as `` traumatic injuries '' to the head and torso . his fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects . officers discovered that richard donohue , a massachusetts bay transportation authority officer , had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout . he survived , but nearly bled to death . dzhokhar tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day , hiding in a boat called the `` slip away '' that was stowed in a backyard in watertown . jurors saw photos of the boat last week . but on monday , they got a chance to see the boat , which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial , in person . before the trial started , prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see . the prosecution sought to remove a panel on which tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes . defense attorney david bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect tsarnaev 's state of mind . in south boston , about a mile from the courthouse , jurors intently looked at the entire boat monday . it had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury . dzhokhar tsarnaev , wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles , watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression . jurors appeared to strain to make out the words tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat . the boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured tsarnaev 's words . aaron cooper reported from boston . catherine e. shoichet and ralph ellis wrote the story in atlanta . cnn 's jake tapper and ann o'neill contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a video purportedly shows three british schoolgirls preparing to cross the turkish border last month into syria , where the teens are believed to have traveled to join isis , a turkish tv network reported friday . if authentic , the video would represent the first publicly released images showing the girls at the turkey-syria border . the video , released by turkish tv network a haber and distributed by reuters , shows three warmly dressed females who resemble the missing teens standing with luggage outside a car and talking to at least one man who is helping them with the bags . the footage purportedly was recorded february 19 in the southeastern turkish city of gaziantep , just north of aleppo , syria , a haber reported . two days before , east london classmates shamima begum , 15 , kadiza sultana , 16 , and amira abase , 15 , boarded a turkish airlines plane from london 's gatwick airport to istanbul without their families ' knowledge , according to british police . `` put your bags . ... hurry , do n't stop here , '' a man says in the video . the girls in the video wear coats , two with fur-lined hoods covering their heads . a third wears a hijab . one appears to be looking at a cell phone . `` he just hung up , '' one of them says . a man takes a bag from the trunk of a yellow vehicle . the vehicle 's license plate has a number that indicates it is registered in the gaziantep area . it was n't immediately clear how a haber obtained the video . cnn could n't immediately verify the footage 's authenticity . the video 's release came a day after turkey 's foreign minister said his country arrested a `` spy '' who allegedly helped the british girls get into syria . the alleged agent was working for a country that is part of an international anti-isis coalition , foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said thursday . separately , a turkish official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the suspect is not turkish , and is not a citizen of the country for which he was working . this month , a turkish broadcaster released images that it said showed the british girls boarding a bus in istanbul after they arrived from london . they are thought to have crossed the turkish border into syria within days . a trip to gaziantep would have been long : the border town is more than 525 miles to the southeast of istanbul . authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in turkey and believe they have crossed into syria , parts of which have been taken over by islamist terror group isis . the girls ' parents have publicly begged for them to come home . days before they left for turkey , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , aqsa mahmood , who left her home in scotland to travel to syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media . she has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to syria to marry jihadis , as she did . her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter , which recommends that those traveling to syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much , since they may need to move often and at short notice , while remaining inconspicuous .
aberdeenshire , scotland -lrb- cnn -rrb- the scottish highlands on a wintry morning in january made for an awe-inspiring interview setting . we traveled along narrow roads winding among snow-capped mountains , eventually arriving at birkhall -- the scottish home to prince charles and his wife , camilla , duchess of cornwall . i had pitched for interviews with the couple several times over the years and finally prince charles accepted . i wanted to speak to them about their 10 years of marriage and their upcoming u.s. tour . the couple 's first tour as newlyweds was also to the united states , so it felt like an appropriate moment to take stock . when you reach the house , it strikes you as an idyllic royal hideaway . it has the sense of a castle but is welcoming like a farmhouse . it has a pinkish hue and green window frames that take in the stunning views . we went in the back entrance and were escorted through the house to the dining room at the front where we set things up . rarely have cameras been allowed in , and never to this part of the house . as we were getting ready , an aide announced someone wanted to say hello . the duchess of cornwall appeared from around the corner , keen to welcome the crew . we spoke about what all brits talk about -- the weather . prince charles opens up about love and life . she is not what you might expect when you meet her . she 's more charismatic , which is something i hope comes across in the cnn special , `` spotlight : charles and camilla . '' unfortunately she had declined our request to be interviewed . she 's never done one and does n't plan to . she wants the limelight to be on her husband . the duchess of cornwall had however allowed our cameras to get close enough to pick up sound during some of her public appearances . that would give viewers a greater sense of her character than they had had before . when prince charles arrived , he also insisted on meeting the crew , which was great but was also eating into our interview time . in the end , we had the full 20 minutes as planned . you can make your own judgements of the tv special , but i think we did manage to give you a good sense of him . he was comfortable enough to be himself . he was the same person on camera as off . afterward , we walked through the house and into the garden for some additional shots . the duchess of cornwall joined us on the way and was worried i would be cold without a coat , but the coat was inaccessible and i did n't want to hold things up . you ca n't tell an awful lot about someone by spending just a morning with them , particularly as a journalist , but my impression was that they are close , connected and have fun . i then left them to take a stroll on their own with the crew , who captured some shots that i think have a small place in royal history -- a glimpse of a couple enjoying each other 's company in their private wilderness , before he ascends to the throne .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- just when you did n't think republicans could top themselves in finding ways to disrespect the president of the united states , on monday , 47 republican senators -- that is , all but seven -- sent a letter to iran that appeared aimed at scuttling president obama 's diplomatic efforts to prevent tehran developing nuclear weapons capacity . the move comes on the heels of house republicans inviting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to address congress -- without even informing the white house of the plan to issue an invitation . but this latest measure went a step further , seeing republicans in congress literally stepping on the constitutional toes of the executive branch and formally intruding on u.s. diplomacy . under the logan act passed by congress way back in 1799 , u.s. citizens are prevented from influencing `` disputes or controversies '' involving the united states and a foreign government , without express authority to do so . now , it appears the iran letter was carefully drafted by sen. tom cotton , a smart constitutional lawyer , to come as close as possible to the line of legality without crossing it , specifically by not explicitly taking a position against the iran negotiations . yet the intent to interfere with the executive branch is clear . it 's one thing for congress to demand it ratify such a deal -lrb- as democrats did in 2002 when president bush negotiated arms reductions with russian president vladimir putin -rrb- . but it 's something else entirely to undermine the authority of the white house by sending a partisan letter to a foreign government -lrb- something democrats did n't do with russia -rrb- . sadly , this is only the most recent and extreme example of dishonor and disrespect . in the washington post , columnist jonathan capehart recently outlines what he sees as the top six instances of disrespect toward president obama . his list includes the example of former new york mayor rudy giuliani saying , `` i do not believe that the president loves america . '' also on capehart 's list are the time a reporter from the conservative daily caller website interrupted the president during remarks at the white house about immigration reform in 2012 , and the time south carolina congressman joe wilson , a republican , heckled the president during his speech to a joint session of congress about health care reform . -lrb- wilson shouted `` you lie ! '' in response to remarks by the president that , it should be noted , were in fact quite true -rrb- . and there are plenty more examples of republican slights against president obama . most famously , there was the widespread questioning of obama 's citizenship and academic credentials that included signs at conservative rallies describing obama as a `` lyin ' african . '' and there was the republican women 's group that created an image of `` food stamp dollars '' with obama 's face on them -lrb- as well as a bucket of kfc and watermelon -rrb- . there was also republican presidential candidate and former speaker of the house newt gingrich decrying obama 's `` kenyan , anti-colonial behavior . '' plus there was then-arizona gov. jan brewer waving her finger at president obama when she greeted air force one on the tarmac . brewer later alleged she `` felt a little bit threatened '' by the president . taken as a whole , this list suggests a troubling pattern of profound disrespect for the president . but more than this , it seems to reflect an anti-obama fever that has gripped the republican party -- one that the letter to iran suggests shows no signs of breaking , and is a sure sign of sickness in the republican party . is the lack of respect being shown toward president obama about race , as some have suggested ? yes and no . certainly , for a segment of the country , it really is about being uncomfortable with a black president . indeed , even former secretary of state colin powell , a republican , noted what he described as a `` dark vein '' of intolerance in the party and parts of the country in general . but beyond that hopefully shrinking share of the population that is explicitly racist , there is a far wider issue of implicit racial bias -- an unconscious , yet nonetheless real tendency , to subject president obama to extra scrutiny because of the color of his skin . none of this is to suggest that all of the criticism aimed at president obama stems from implicit racial bias . but such bias appears to be a factor in the ease and extremity of disrespect aimed at america 's first black president . and this disrespect mirrors the disrespect shown against black americans in general . `` honorable people can disagree over policy , '' vice president joe biden said in a statement tuesday . yes , and they should do so honorably . whatever republicans ' gripes about president obama 's vision and leadership , the party and its followers are too often expressing their critiques in an ugly way . and that rampant pattern of disrespect -- for any fellow human being , let alone the president of the united states of america -- is what truly undermines the principles and values of our nation .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- empathy . confidence . passion . these are the traits the next police chief in ferguson , missouri , will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police . so says cecil smith . and maybe he should know . smith is the police chief in sanford , florida , another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police-community relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of trayvon martin . and if smith 's experience is any guide , it will take `` a lot of prayer and a little goading '' to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by chief thomas jackson . `` that community , as we see , has been hurting and struggling for some time now , '' he says . and how : . -- the community remains deeply scarred by the events last year , after the august shooting death of unarmed african-american teenager michael brown by a white ferguson officer darren wilson , and the november decision by the st. louis county grand jury not to charge wilson , who later resigned . occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust . -- the police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week 's release of a damning department of justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of ferguson officials . -- add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early thursday of two police officers only hours after jackson resigned . the decision for jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city , mayor james knowles told reporters . he 'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to ferguson police lt. col al eickhoff next week . the city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement , knowles said . `` the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity . we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness , '' said knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign . to get there , it might look to sanford for guidance . there , trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the trayvon martin shooting . while no police officers were involved in the shooting , anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager 's killer , george zimmerman , pushed relations in the community to a boiling point , eventually resulting in the firing of chief bill lee . zimmerman eventually was arrested , and a jury acquitted him . smith watched the chaos play out from elgin , illinois , where he was deputy police chief . a former boss in illinois suggested he look at the job , so he traveled to florida on his own time , getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police . he still is n't sure how to explain why he took the job . `` the first year , i was still wondering , was it a smart move ? '' smith joked . but things are better now , he says . after taking the job , smith made it a point of spending time `` walking and talking '' in sanford , building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents . inside the department , stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing . he also stepped up recruitment of african-american officers . `` one of the things that 's going on is we do n't have people who look like us in the community , '' said smith , himself an african-american . he handed out long-delayed promotions . and he even presided over a makeover , enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms . the new chief in ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things , smith says . community leaders and other officials agree . `` we need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind chief jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues , '' patricia bynes , a democratic committeewoman for ferguson township , '' told cnn wednesday . `` we need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run . '' new york police commissioner william bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces . there is the lack of trust on the community 's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership . on the first issue , he said : `` you need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change . '' to police leadership consultant john vanek , whoever takes over the ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines , to think differently , to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight . but that 's easier said than done . `` there 's going to be a lot of hostility in ferguson for a long time , '' he said . so will the new chief need to be african-american to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city ? here 's the politic answer : find the right candidate , regardless of race . `` you want to find the best candidate to be police chief , '' said attorney benjamin crump , who has represented the families of both trayvon martin and michael brown . `` but diversity is very important . it 's very important that the police officers understand the communities , at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving . '' `` there 's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed , '' crump said . `` we do n't want to be policed . we want to be protected and served as any american citizen .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` i will come to tunisia .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- university of virginia student leaders have scheduled a campus forum with police friday to discuss allegations of brutality following the bloody arrest of a 20-year-old student that prompted protests at uva . the incident early wednesday involved uniformed alcohol control agents and martese johnson , an african-american student at uva . it made headlines around the country and prompted gov. terry mcauliffe to order an independent virginia state police investigation into what happened . the on-campus forum is scheduled for 1 p.m. friday . in a facebook post , the university 's student council said representatives from charlottesville , virginia , police , albemarle county police and the state alcohol beverage control were to attend the forum `` to engage in a conversation about their relationship with students , or lack thereof , and about the issue of police brutality . '' johnson 's arrest prompted protests among students demanding `` justice for martese '' after images circulated showing his bloodied face and clothing . while what happened wednesday remains under investigation , video from the incident shows johnson pinned to the ground , screaming : `` i go to uva ! ... you f ****** racists ! what the f *** ? how did this happen ? '' an officer can be heard telling the man to stop fighting . according to the student 's attorney , daniel watkins , `` just before handcuffing him , police took martese to the ground , striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head . '' he needed 10 stitches to close the gash in his head , watkins said . johnson was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice , according to the virginia department of alcoholic beverage control , which acknowledged he suffered injuries during his arrest . the agents were placed on administrative duties during the investigation , the agency said . the black student alliance said the arrest reminds black uva students `` of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice . '' in a news release , the university called the arrest disturbing , and university president teresa sullivan issued a statement saying that `` every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence . '' virginia attorney general mark herring appealed for patience . `` certainly the images that we 've all been looking at in charlottesville are shocking , but it 's really important that we get the facts out and understand exactly what happened , '' johnson said . friday 's forum will be held at a theater on the uva campus . the student council said media would not be allowed to ask questions or bring cameras into the forum but said the event would be live-streamed on the internet . `` this is a student space -- a chance for students to ask the questions they feel are most pressing to virginia 's most senior law enforcement officials , '' the group said on facebook . students leaders asked their contemporaries to tweet questions in advance . as of midmorning friday , only a handful of tweets had crossed using the proposed hashtag '' #policedialogue . '' `` is the problematic influence of implicit bias discussed at all during police training , '' twitter user yaejmeister asked . among other questions , one student asked why alcohol control agents have police powers . a third wondered `` is catering to uva 's hypersensitivity preparing our students for the world outside of ` grounds ' ? '' the incident comes amid a continuing nationwide debate over the use of force by police , particularly involving african-americans , following the deaths last summer of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and eric garner in new york . grand juries in both communities declined to indict white police officers in the deaths , leading to angry protests nationwide and calls for renewed attention to claims of police bullying and brutality .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- all 11 service members aboard an army black hawk helicopter that crashed in waters off the florida panhandle two days ago are believed dead , and the operation has transitioned from rescue to recovery , an air force official said thursday . the military is now focused on recovering the helicopter , which searchers found at the bottom of the santa rosa sound near eglin air force base , and the bodies of all seven marines and four louisiana army national guard members who were aboard , air force col. monte cannon said . also ahead : trying to determine why the aircraft went down in thick fog during a training mission tuesday , cannon said . `` the decision to suspend is always difficult , '' said layne carter , search and rescue mission coordinator of the u.s. coast guard . `` with heavy hearts , we have decided to suspend active search and rescue operations . our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of the members involved in this tragedy . '' the bodies of at least two national guard members were recovered thursday , and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface , the guard said . the troops were with 1-244th assault helicopter battalion from hammond , louisiana , according to a statement from the louisiana national guard . the military had previously said that some remains had washed ashore wednesday . military officials declined to say thursday how many bodies still were missing , and they did not release the names of the service members involved in the crash . two black hawk helicopters were training near eglin in heavy fog when one of them went down in the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. tuesday , the military has said . a couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise , but `` nobody saw anything because of the dense fog , '' said mark giuliano , chief of the eglin air force base 's fire department . `` people said they heard a loud bang , and that was it , '' giuliano said thursday . the second black hawk -- which , like the first , was assigned to the 1-244th assault helicopter battalion based in hammond , louisiana -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of pensacola . `` whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , '' eglin spokesman andy bourland said earlier this week . giuliano said his fire department , which has a unit on santa rosa island near the crash site , was called to help at about 10 p.m. tuesday , roughly 90 minutes after the crash . the military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage , he said . investigators from the army and the marines will try to determine what caused the wreck , cannon said thursday . military officials have said it 's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash . the 11 service members , all men , were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations , said capt. barry morris , a spokesman for the u.s. marines corps special operations command . it involved small boats , and inserting and extracting marines from the water via helicopter . morris would not say which phase of the training the marines were in tuesday night . the seven marines were with a marine special operations regiment out of camp lejeune , north carolina . the initial search was hampered by dense fog , to the point that searchers on boats `` could not see , '' giuliano said . on wednesday morning , after searchers got a sonar hit , a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound , giuliano said . divers then went into the water `` to start retrieving the aircrew , '' giuliano said , without specifying how many bodies were recovered . the helicopter had broken into several pieces in a `` high-impact crash , '' he said . the coast guard has hired a salvage company from mobile , alabama , to take the wreckage from the water , but that company might not arrive until thursday evening , and weather conditions may delay the recovery until friday , giuliano said . gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , expressed his condolences on wednesday . he said the crash was `` a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat . '' `` we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- her murder shocked a nation , but according to the slain woman 's father , it also woke turkey up . ozgecan aslan 's body was found last month , burned and abandoned , just days after her family reported her missing . she allegedly fought off a sexual assault before being killed by the driver of a bus she 'd taken to go home . her death sparked widespread protests . `` a country woke up , '' aslan 's father , mehmet aslan , told cnn in a phone interview . `` there was no way for so many people to come together over a single killing . but , i know that my ozgecan was sent for a reason . and as devastating it is , it was her part , her destiny to wake people up . '' aslan , 20 , was a first-year university student . she studied psychology . `` my ozge lived for peace , '' her father said . `` for peace , love and beauty . she believed in a better tomorrow . '' since her death , hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets and online , demanding turkey do more to protect women . they say the problem is cultural ; it 's also criminal . bianet , a turkish group that tracks violence against women , reports that at least 281 women were killed in turkey in 2014 -- up 31 % from the previous year . according to hulya gulbahar , a turkish activist and women 's rights lawyer , laws are irregularly applied . `` in a majority of turkey 's female abuse cases , the perpetrators receive mitigations in their sentences due to court 's detection of consent granted by the victim , '' gulbahar said . `` in some cases , wearing a miniskirt or some cleavage got the woman 's rapist mitigation in his punishment , while in some cases the consent was attached to her wearing red . '' it 's unclear what will happen in aslan 's case . three suspects have been arrested in her death , turkey 's semiofficial news agency anadolu has reported . the agency identified the main suspect as 26-year-old ahmet suphi altindoken and said that he had confessed . aslan reportedly fought him using pepper spray , which had been given to her by her mother . although he is heartbroken and angry , mehmet aslan is n't out for revenge . in fact , his family has received donations from across the country and is planning to use those to set up a rehabilitation center -- not for women who are abused but for men who abuse . `` we must surrender to love , '' he told cnn . `` otherwise , we all lose . '' aslan 's murder is similar in many ways to well-known case in india . there , a student was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012 . she was raped and later died from her injuries . like aslan 's murder , her death triggered massive outrage and nationwide protests . and like turkey , india has a serious problem when it comes to women 's rights . out of 142 countries , turkey ranks 125th -lrb- india ranks 114th -rrb- on the world economic forum 's 2014 gender gap index . on sunday , some 3,000 women marched in istanbul to mark international women 's day , anadolu reported . the female-only rally was dedicated in aslan 's memory . `` ozgecan 's screams have indeed been heard . maybe not that very instant , but later -- and in millions of hearts , '' said mehmet aslan .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i met kelly gissendaner in january 2010 in a nondescript classroom at metro state prison for women in atlanta . she arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four atlanta seminaries . since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement , kelly was particularly eager to share community with others , if only one morning a week . and she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life . that image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who kelly is -- who she has become : someone full of contagious joy and gratitude , open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry . kelly 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , doug gissendaner . a pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult , yet compassionate , conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection . this same pastor has been visiting kelly for almost 16 years . her commitment to kelly , along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change . so by the time i met kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation . she was , in the words of the apostle paul , a `` new creation '' -lrb- 2 cor . 5:17 -rrb- . in the theology program , kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on christian faith could be a gift to the wider church `` on the outside , '' as well as in prison . by studying historical and contemporary christian thinkers , kelly became part of the conversations that make the christian tradition dynamic . she asked honest questions about her relationship to god , others and the world . she read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions . she discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work . `` from the start of the theology class i felt this hunger , '' she said in her 2011 graduation speech . `` i became so hungry for theology , and what all the classes had to offer ; you could call me a glutton . '' one of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically , not only as thinkers , but also as human beings wrestling with some of life 's most urgent questions . my relationship with kelly had this quality from the start . but it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison . in her graduation speech , kelly described this moment : . `` there came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- i was pulled from the courses . i was taken from my theological community . being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down . `` since i could n't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me . still , this was far from being ideal because now i had to have class and community through a gate . it was hard ... but i pushed on . i pushed on because of that hunger . that gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me . but that gate could n't keep out the knowledge that i was so hungry for , nor friendship and community . and it sure could n't keep out god . '' this change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every friday . we continued to read theological texts together , including a book by then-archbishop of canterbury rowan williams . williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories , `` the ruins of the past , '' and building from them here and now . restoration , williams writes , `` is going back to the memories of the painful , humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to christ -lsb- who -rsb- comes to repair the devastation . '' i sat with kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done . indeed , the power of these moments -- when kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins , when we spoke of god 's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever . kelly embraced what dietrich bonhoeffer , a german pastor-theologian and nazi resister , calls `` costly grace . '' for bonhoeffer , `` cheap grace '' is seeking god 's forgiveness as a `` cover-up for one 's sins , for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free . '' in contrast , costly grace requires rigorously following jesus in a way that leads to continuous , visible transformation , what the new testament calls the fruits of redemption . the fruits of kelly 's redemption are now well-documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others . on the night kelly thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged . most poignant for kelly are the writings of german theologian jürgen moltmann , who is widely known as the `` theologian of hope '' and with whom kelly began corresponding in 2010 . moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave . rather , hope makes manifest the kingdom of god now -- god 's intended social order `` on earth as it is in heaven '' -lrb- matt . 6:10 -rrb- . biblical hope `` revolutionizes and transforms the present . '' it is the hope of the psalmist who `` looks for the goodness of god in this life '' -lrb- ps . 27:13 -rrb- . in the words of kelly 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : `` i shall not die but live , and declare the works of the lord '' -lrb- ps 118:17 -rrb- . in kelly 's own words : . `` the theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , i still possess the ability to prove that i am human . labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things . but no matter the label attached to me , i have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... even prison can not erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me , or anyone . '' many people have asked me in recent days how i have been transformed by my friendship with kelly and by kelly 's journey of hope . while i struggle to find adequate words , what i do know is that kelly 's story pushes the logic of christian faith to its outermost limits . it pushes christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance , forgiveness , redemption and hope . indeed , even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make . today , kelly 's life hangs in the balance . the state of georgia on monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her . the department of corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete . while gov. nathan deal does not have the formal power to commute kelly 's sentence to life in prison , i join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation , including more than 500 from georgia , who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save kelly 's life and to speak out publicly against her execution . i call on all people of good will to reach out to gov. deal and to georgia state legislators to demand a more just , merciful , and accountable system of justice -- for kelly and for all . as theologian richard amesbury wrote , `` if the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected , then none of us is without hope . '' we need to hear kelly gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of god are real .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there can be no march without the madness . when it comes to college basketball , the first month of spring ushers in a frantic slew of games to determine seedings for one of the most fervently watched sporting events in the u.s. , known simply as the ncaa tournament , or more often , march madness . like english soccer 's fa cup , much of the 68-team tournament 's appeal is its egalitarian system of pitting traditional powerhouse programs like duke , ucla and kentucky against relative minnows like saint mary 's , butler and davidson . and both competitions offer the carrot of being able to impress scouts from top pro teams -- a first-round nba pick can expect to earn anywhere from $ 755,000 to $ 5.75 million . not bad for a graduate . last year 's tournament reached 102 million viewers , while almost 740,000 fans attended the 36 sessions . `` when you go to college , maybe your number one goal before you graduate is you want to be able to play in the ncaa tournament , '' says bryce drew , head coach and former player at valparaiso university in indiana -lrb- 28-5 , horizon league champions -rrb- . `` it 's the biggest stage for college basketball , and it 's one of the biggest national events in all of america . '' drew knows just how big an impact that high-profile stage can have on aspiring professionals from beyond the major college ranks . his last-second shot for valparaiso to beat the university of mississippi in the first round of the 1998 tournament is one of the most replayed moments in march madness history . how it works : . selection sunday -lrb- march 15 -rrb- . a 10-member panel determines seedings for the 68 teams that make the knockout tournament . first four -lrb- march 17-18 -rrb- . a format started in 2011 , 8 teams compete to qualify in the main draw . second round -lrb- march 19-20 -rrb- . 64 teams split into 4 regions : midwest , west , south and east . # 1 plays # 16 in each group . third round -lrb- march 21-22 -rrb- . down to 32 teams . regional semifinals -lrb- march 26-27 -rrb- . known as the `` sweet sixteen '' regional finals -lrb- march 28-29 -rrb- . the `` elite eight '' national semifinals -lrb- april 4 -rrb- . the `` final four '' is played at lucas oil stadium in indianapolis ; minimum capacity 70,000 . championship game -lrb- april 6 -rrb- . one of the most-watched events in u.s. sport . `` i had always dreamed of winning the game in the ncaa tournament -lrb- and -rrb- always dreamed of making the last-second shot . for god to bless -lrb- me -rrb- with both of things at one time is something that i 'll always cherish and remember , '' drew says . his father , homer drew , was valparaiso 's coach at the time , and his brother scott -lrb- now men 's basketball coach at baylor university -rrb- was an assistant , completing the hollywood scenario . `` i do n't think any of us realized that they would show that replay the next year , and even the next year , and the next year . we were just so happy in the moment and never thought that we 'd be able to talk about it over a decade later , '' he says . showing the highlight is virtually a prerequisite whenever drew coaches a nationally televised game , and is sure to come up next week when his crusaders play in the `` big dance '' -lrb- one more nickname for the tournament . -rrb- . drew was a senior nearing graduation at the time . although he had heard about professional scouts attending his games , being drafted by an nba team was still considered a longshot . after all , the last time a valparaiso graduate dribbled a basketball in the nba was in 1956 . but that was before `` the shot . '' although drew says private workouts for pro teams solidified his spot as the first valparaiso player to be drafted in the nba 's first round -lrb- as the 16th pick , -rrb- he confesses that tournament attention is likely what got his foot in the door . `` it helped me get my name out there , because they got to see me play against a different type of athlete in the ncaa tournament on a different stage , '' he says . observing athletes during march madness -- when competition is at its highest level -- is the best way to gauge if they will succeed as pros , according to one player representative . `` it definitely helps an agent to learn how a player will perform under a national stage , '' says jared karnes , co-founder of a3 athletics agency in knoxville , tennessee . `` if they want to play in the nba , they are going to be expected to play under a tremendous amount of pressure and attention . '' michael beasley , the second overall selection in the 2008 nba draft , is one of karnes ' clients who has failed to live up to that pressure so far . now 26 , he recently found his way back to the nba with the miami heat after a spell in china . karnes , a former player himself at little-known belmont university who `` had the unfortunate assignment of having to guard bryce drew , '' says he enjoys recruiting clients from smaller programs because they lack the air of entitlement that can weigh on household names . `` a lot of times they 've had to work their way into the spotlight , and so they develop a hard work ethic , '' he says . `` they really have an appreciation about what 's happened to them ; the more you can identify a talent with a level of high character , as an agent you 've just found a terrific prospect . '' among the most successful small-program players in the nba is former davidson standout stephen curry -- the current mvp frontrunner with the golden state warriors . norris cole , who played at cleveland state and won two championships with the miami heat , and gordon hayward , a starting forward for the utah jazz , have also made their mark . cole strikes a particular chord with drew since they both came out of the unheralded horizon league , a division one conference made up of nine midwestern schools . it was the less glamorous side of the game that set cole apart from other prospects . `` his defense is what helped him get drafted from our league , '' says drew , who suited up for four nba teams in six seasons before playing in italy and spain . `` a lot of guys can score and shoot , but when you get to the nba , really being able to defend someone separates you . '' hayward led butler -- a so-called `` mid-major '' program that exited the horizon league two years ago -- all the way to the 2010 national championship game against duke , only to watch his desperation half-court shot narrowly miss at the buzzer . although hayward turned pro after the two-point loss , butler 's exposure to potential recruits allowed the bulldogs to return to the championship game the next year , and to the third round in 2013 . with an enrollment of only 4,500 students , it is the smallest school to play in the final for over 30 years . in 2013 , butler 's 36-year-old brad stevens became the youngest head coach in the nba when he signed a $ 22 million contract with the boston celtics . `` even though they are so wildly successful as a team -lrb- now , -rrb- butler right before that was n't well known , '' says karnes , adding that it was hayward who first put it on the map . `` you can find diamonds in these smaller schools . '' drew hopes to emulate butler 's past success this postseason . he 's already led valparaiso to its highest victory total and winning percentage in school history . led by 6-foot-10-inch jamaican senior vashil fernandez -lrb- five blocked shots against green bay in the horizon league tournament final -rrb- and 6 ' 9 '' sophomore alec peters , the crusaders are hoping for a high seed when a 10-member committee meets this `` selection sunday '' to rank the tournament 's 68 participants . valparaiso 's nightmare scenario would be an early-round pairing with last year 's runner-up kentucky . the wildcats -lrb- 31-0 -rrb- aim to become the first team to go undefeated and win the national championship since the indiana hoosiers in 1976 . drew calls coach john calipari 's team -- powered by a front line of 7-footers willie cauley-stein and dakari johnson , along with 6 ' 11 '' karl-anthony towns -- as the deepest he 's ever seen in college basketball . six of kentucky 's players are considered worthy of june 's nba draft . while karnes remains guarded about which college basketball players he 's scouting , inking deals with kentucky players after the tournament is probably a longshot . `` you talk about these smaller schools that are out there , we 're that way as a boutique agency , '' he says .
ferguson , missouri -lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson 's police chief and other city officials are already out . now some residents have told the missouri city they 'll try to oust the mayor , too . five residents friday filed an affidavit saying they 'll try to force a referendum on whether to remove mayor james knowles -- capping a tumultuous week in a community grappling not only with last year 's fatal shooting of teenager michael brown , but also wednesday 's wounding of two police officers shot during a protest . a group supporting the filing , organization for black struggle , a 35-year-old st. louis-based activist group , said the five would try to collect enough signatures -- 15 % of the city 's registered voters -- in the next 60 days . the five `` initiated recall -lrb- attempt -rrb- due to mayor knowles ' failure to adequately rein in an out-of-control police department during the protests following mike brown 's death , '' the activist group said . the city government acknowledged saturday that it received the affidavit . earlier this week , the police chief and the city manager resigned in the wake of a u.s. justice department report alleging institutionalized racism at just about every level of ferguson 's municipal government , including the police department . residents elect city council members , who in turn appoint the city manager . the city manager directs and supervises all city departments , including police . the top municipal court clerk was fired earlier in connection with racist emails . this month 's justice department report was initiated after one of ferguson 's police officers , darren wilson , shot and killed african-american teen michael brown in august , a shooting that spurred months of protests . wilson , a white officer who said he shot brown in self-defense , will not be charged in the case -- a grand jury declared it would n't indict him in november , and the justice department said this month that it would not bring federal civil rights charges in the case . wilson resigned from the department in november , citing security concerns . knowles indicated friday he wo n't be stepping down . `` i think it 's important to recognize that there 's a lot of people who may be angry at the situation ; there 's a lot of people who are frustrated in this community with the way things have gone down , '' the mayor , who is white , told cnn . `` but there 's a lot of people who still -- and who have expressed this to me -- express confidence in both my willingness , and members of the -lrb- city -rrb- council 's willingness , to listen , to be responsive , and to make changes as necessary , '' he continued . `` people in the community recognize this , now , not everybody . i did n't win every time with 100 % of the vote . but i can tell you there are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people , '' the mayor said . blake ashby , a white resident of ferguson , said friday that he believed knowles has `` consciously tried to reach out to all parts '' of the city of 21,000 people . `` if we lose mayor knowles , we lose a force for change , and it will be harder to make the changes that the doj -lrb- department of justice -rrb- is asking for , '' ashby said . rasheen aldridge , a black member of a commission charged with recommending reforms in ferguson , said that knowles needed to resign in the wake of the doj report . `` he knew what was going on during his watch , '' said aldridge , a member of the ferguson commission , which gov. jay nixon formed last year . investigators still are seeking breaks in the case of two police officers who were shot wednesday night during a protest in ferguson . while the demonstrators ' focus was ferguson , neither of the wounded officers works for that police department . one is from webster groves , a st. louis suburb 13 miles south of ferguson . the officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , police said . the other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back . he is a 41-year-old officer with the st. louis county police who has been in law enforcement for 14 years . both were treated and released . `` i can not tell you an arrest is imminent , and there 's certainly no one in custody , '' st. louis county police chief jon belmar told reporters friday afternoon . `` the detectives are working this investigation around the clock , and they will not rest until we have a conclusion in this investigation , '' the chief said . police have `` several leads , '' he said . `` i think we have a pretty good general idea of where we think the shots came from .

tunis -lrb- cnn -rrb- the bodies of four italian tourists slain in a terror attack on tunisia 's bardo museum three days ago arrived back in italy on saturday , an official with the tunis crisis center told cnn , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue . as tunisia gets back on its feet , the investigation into wednesday 's shooting at the tunis landmark continues . most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated . nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis . french , spanish , italian , british , japanese , russian and colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far . the bodies of the italians were met in rome by italian prime minister matteo renzi , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony . eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in tunisia on saturday , the official at the tunis crisis center said . tunisian prime minister habib essid identified two suspects in the attack , yassine labidi and saber khachnaou , in an interview with french radio station rtl on thursday , though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces . he said yassine was `` known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , '' but not known or being followed for anything special . authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from tunisian president beji caid essebsi . an uncle of yassine labidi , abeld malik labidi , told cnn on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew . but he said yassine labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum . `` it 's true that yassine carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , '' he said . but , he said , he believed yassine and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like syria and libya to train as fighters . he had known his nephew well , he said . `` after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young tunisian . he was n't extreme in any way . '' the only thing that raised questions was that yassine had disappeared for about a month , he said . although his nephew said he 'd gone to the tunisian city of sfax to work , his family now suspected he had been in libya because of the phone numbers he called from . `` when he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious . nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors i spoke to , '' said abeld malik labidi . `` he said hello to everyone , he prayed , he took his coffee , even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work . '' abeld malik labidi said yassine 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack . officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said . a cousin of yassine , who asked not to be named , told cnn that the family was shocked by what had happened . `` we are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may god forgive him . those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm australians or japanese ... our islam does n't mention about killing people , islam has never been this , '' he said . he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was `` a normal tunisian guy ... but not an extremist . '' security minister rafik chelly said on friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in libya . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , he said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . `` they left the country illegally last december for libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster alhiwar ettounsi tv . like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring . but unlike its neighbor to the west , libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by islamist militants . in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and apostates '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators . cnn 's claudia rebaza reported from tunis and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's radina gigova and greg botelho contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- lindsey vonn may have missed out on gold at last month 's world championships , but the american skier has set her sights on end-of-season glory after claiming a record-extending 65th world cup win on sunday . vonn 's victory in the super-g event at garmisch-partenkirchen in germany gave her the outright lead in the speed discipline ahead of this month 's finals in france . having finished seventh in saturday 's downhill , the 30-year-old rebounded by coming home 0.2 seconds ahead of overall world cup leader tina maze , whose coach set up the course . it put vonn eight points ahead of super-g world champion anna fenninger , who placed third to give back the 20 points she 'd earned over maze the day before -- when their positions were reversed . `` i think it was set probably against anna , '' said vonn , who took bronze behind maze at last month 's world championships in colorado . `` that was a wise choice by tina 's coach . but it also really suited me and i liked it . '' `` it 's going to be a close fight in downhill and super-g , so i will really have to ski my best at the finals in meribel . hopefully i can get two titles , '' added vonn , who is 35 points ahead of fenninger in the downhill standings . but vonn is well off the pace in the fight for the overall crown -- which she last won in 2012 , her fourth success -- in third place almost 200 points behind the austrian . maze is another 44 points ahead of fenninger , with just two slalom events in sweden next week before the march 16-22 finale . `` of course it 's a great result but i prefer to win , '' the slovenian said . `` lindsey was simply better today and she deserves this win . `` my whole team stands behind me and supports me and i am really thankful to them . valerio did a great job setting the course . it was a fast and nice course set with not too many turns . '' fenninger , who also won the world giant slalom title at beaver creek , said she will focus on her strengths after claiming a 12th podium this season . `` it was a fast super-g and that 's maybe not what i am the best at , '' said the 25-year-old . `` overall it 's been a good weekend . honestly i thought tina was going to be better than me in the downhill and that i would catch up in the super-g . it turned out to be different . `` i am focusing on my strengths , this is why i am not going to race slalom next week . now i have to train giant slalom in order to show my best skiing and maximize my chances to win the giant slalom globe . '' meanwhile , kjetil jansrud clinched the men 's super-g title with victory on home snow in in kvitfjell on sunday . the norwegian , who missed out on securing the downhill crystal globe when he finished seventh on saturday , opened up an unassailable 123-point lead over italian dominik paris . `` this is the first globe of my career , '' said the 29-year-old . `` it 's good to not have to go into the final weekend feeling like there are two guys pushing me on the cup and i have to fend off both of them . that 's a big thing because i can leave the super-g and focus on the downhill . '' jansrud has a 20-point lead over hannes reichelt in the downhill , but is less confident of overhauling his 52-point deficit on another austrian , three-time defending champion marcel hirscher , in the overall standings . the men next travel to slovenia for slalom events next weekend . `` i think he will gain some extra points in kranjska gora , so i 'm not very concerned about the overall , '' jansrud said of hirscher . `` i think he 'll pull through . but it might get exciting . he has no room for error and anything can happen . ''
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- the primary suspect jailed in connection with the shooting death of boris nemtsov withdrew his confession wednesday , saying he had been under duress during his admission and is n't guilty . zaur dadayev told two members of russia 's human rights council that he pleaded guilty after being detained because he was scared . he told eva merkacheva and andrey babushkin he had been tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened . dadayev was one of two suspects recently charged in the case . three other suspects have not been charged . merkacheva and babushkin were accused of `` interfering '' with the investigation and will be summoned for questioning over their motives , authorities said . russia 's investigative committee stated that the two rights activists violated the law when they visited and questioned dadayev in a moscow jail . amnesty international condemned the russian officials ' decision to go after the activists , saying that a `` threat to bring criminal charges '' against the rights activists `` raises alarming questions over the fairness of the investigation . '' anton tsvetkov , the head of the public chamber 's commission for public security , said dadyev and two other suspects denied being involved in the shooting of the russian opposition leader . he said a doctor found no signs of torture during an examination of the three men . shagit gubashev and anzor gubashev had no bruises or wounds despite the fact they allege they were beaten by police , tsvetkov said . dadayev did have a cracked tooth and handcuff marks on his wrists . nemtsov , one of president vladimir putin 's most outspoken critics , was shot in the back on a moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the kremlin in february 27 . the three suspects visited by tsvetkov deny they are guilty and have appealed their arrests , he said . putin has condemned nemtsov 's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate , the kremlin has said . he also wrote to nemtsov 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice . cnn 's matthew chance and alla eshchenko reported from moscow , and steve almasy wrote from atlanta . cnn 's elwyn lopez and karen smith contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old . her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day . the experience was enough for her to wish she was dead . and this all took place in texas -- right here , in our own country . melissa miraculously escaped her captors but , as is the case with so many other victims , she struggled for years to distance herself from her past , even finding herself in jail on multiple occasions . and while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from america 's history books , thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking . indeed , with the average age of a victim only 13 years old , these horrific crimes are stealing the innocent childhoods of kids across america . and the problem is n't confined to one part of the country . in , minnesota , for example , a 12-year-old girl received a text message that she thought was from a friend . it invited her to go to a party and asked her to go to a fast food restaurant nearby . but she did n't get to a party . instead , she was taken to a hotel and raped by a 34-year-old pimp , forced to take explicit photos of herself that were then posted on craigslist , before being forced to have sex with two more men who saw the post . these heartbreaking stories demonstrate what is broken about our current system , and why we both feel committed to fixing it . instead of treating people like these young girls as the victims they are , they are often thrown into the criminal justice system , labeled prostitutes and left with few options but to return to a nightmare that shockingly still exists in the united states . meanwhile , instead of treating their perpetrators as child rapists and traffickers , they are often simply treated as `` johns '' who , if caught , often pay a fine and go on their way . this is outrageous , and should not be tolerated any longer . that is why we 've joined forces with more than 200 advocacy groups to fight this modern-day slave trade and provide hope and opportunity for its victims . two bills we have introduced to combat this horrific crime recently passed the senate judiciary committee with strong support and will have the opportunity for consideration by the senate . the justice for victims of trafficking act -lrb- jvta -rrb- would support victims by taking fines and criminal assets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward services and treatment to help victims restore their lives . the jvta does n't only help victims , it also arms law enforcement with more tools to go after human traffickers . it ensures these criminals , including `` johns , '' are brought to justice under our laws , because a financial transaction should not mask assault on a child . the second bill is modeled after minnesota 's `` safe harbor '' law , which helps make sure minors sold for sex are n't prosecuted as defendants , but are instead treated as victims . the stop exploitation through trafficking act -lrb- sett -rrb- would give incentives for all states to have a safe harbor provision . when a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state 's criminal statutes . all across the country , from texas to minnesota , young people are being robbed of their innocence and subjected to unthinkable horrors and abuse . we must do everything we can to free them from the shackles of sex trafficking . we must join together and take action to combat this modern-day slavery once and for all .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- to come back or not come back ? that is the question former wimbledon champion marion bartoli posed on twitter , prompting a raft of replies and retweets . the frenchwoman was crowned champion at the all england club in july 2013 , but announced her retirement a mere one month later due to persistent injury problems . but now it appears the former world no. 7 is pondering a return to the court , with eight-time grand slam champion jimmy connors warning bartoli to only consider it if she is fully committed . bartoli would n't be the first women 's star to come out of retirement . veterans martina hingis , jennifer capriati and kimiko date-krumm all chose to reenter the fray after saying their initial farewells . bartoli won eight wta titles during a 13-year professional career , reaching the quarterfinals of the australian and u.s. opens and the last four of her home grand slam in paris .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- if it looks like a treaty , walks like a treaty and talks like a treaty , is it a treaty ? according to the white house , only if the president of the united states says it is . that 's infuriating republicans and even some democrats , who are demanding that the obama administration submit any final nuclear deal with iran to congress for approval . `` this is clearly a treaty , '' arizona sen. john mccain told reporters tuesday . `` they can call it a banana , but it 's a treaty . '' kerry denounces gop letter to iran leaders . the gop position could jeopardize the long-term survival of any iran deal , and it represents the party 's newest clash with president barack obama over the limits of executive authority , as republicans object to a pact they warn could eventually give tehran a nuclear bomb . it 's that skepticism that has largely led the white house to define the deal as a `` nonbinding agreement '' rather than a `` treaty , '' which the constitution requires senate `` advice and consent '' on . the distinction -- and whether it can legitimately be used to shut out congress -- turns on complicated and unresolved questions of constitutional law . while republicans call foul , the administration defends the differentiation as perfectly sound , and no surprise . secretary of state john kerry stressed wednesday that the administration never intended to negotiate a treaty . `` we 've been clear from the beginning . we 're not negotiating a ` legally binding plan . ' we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement , '' he said at a senate hearing . that does n't sit well with republicans , many of whom believe the senate 's constitutional role is being bypassed . idaho sen. james risch dismissed the administration 's argument : `` let there be no mistake , this is a treaty that is being negotiated . it 's a treaty and should be treated as such . '' did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? republicans see criticism of the administration 's maneuver as a way to gum up the works on the current deal , and to push their larger assault on the white house 's exercise of power . at the senate hearing wednesday , kentucky republican rand paul explicitly tied the administration 's bid to keep the deal away from congress to other accusations of white house overreach . `` this is an administration that seeks to legislate when that is not in their purview , whether it be immigration , whether it be health care , '' he charged , noting that he had joined 46 other gop senators in signing a letter to the islamic republic informing them of congress 's role in approving binding agreements . `` i signed the letter to iran . but you know what ? the message i was sending was to you , '' he told kerry . `` i signed it to an administration that does n't listen , to an administration that , every turn , tries to go around congress because you think you ca n't get your way . '' but legal experts say that though a court challenge along the lines of pending gop cases on immigration and health care is possible in theory , it would be a long shot . there is no currently no suit on the issue being discussed on capitol hill , and it 's far from clear that republicans would be standing on firm legal ground with such a challenge . the debate , rumbling for decades , has yet to be definitively resolved in case law . `` it is a very interesting question , '' said nicholas burns , a former senior u.s. diplomat , arguing that it is essentially up to the administration to decide whether it is negotiating an agreement that formally binds the united states to commitments under international law ; i.e. , a treaty , or a less stringent arrangement . senators grill obama officials on iran . jim walsh , a specialist on the iran nuclear program at the massachusetts institute of technology , said the iran deal , which commits the united states to waive or lift sanctions , does not rise to the level of a formal treaty . `` treaties traditionally have involved reductions in armaments , nuclear weapons , conventional forces . they require us to take something away that we have already built or established . '' in this case , the united states would lift sanctions , but would not be changing its military posture . `` we have had all sorts of agreement that were never ratified by congress , '' walsh said . but david rivkin , a constitutional and international law expert who worked for president george h.w. bush , said that any international agreement requiring major undertakings on the part of the united states -- such as the proposed iran deal -- must be sent to the senate for advice and consent . `` the constitution is quite clear , '' he said . republicans point to none less than the vice president of the united states to bolster their case . when vice president joe biden was a senator in 2002 , he wrote a letter to then-secretary of state colin powell charging that a planned strategic arms reductions deal with russia constituted a treaty subject to senate approval since it would require `` significant obligations by the united states . '' but biden 's 2002 letter did n't keep him from unleashing his fury at the gop letter to iran on monday . `` around the world , america 's influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments , '' biden said in a statement . while congress approves some agreements , `` as the authors of this letter must know , the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval . '' indeed , in the letter he penned to iran , arkansas sen. tom cotton acknowledged that the administration could seek a mere `` executive agreement '' free of congressional review . obama , iranian official slam gop letter on deal . presidents claim inherent powers to conclude executive agreements under article ii of the constitution . u.s. law stipulates that an agreement is only viewed as a treaty once it has been made with `` the advice and consent of the senate , '' a study by the nonpartisan congressional research service noted . but administrations often choose to conclude deals with foreign states that do n't satisfy that requirement . such an `` executive agreement '' is still considered a treaty that is binding under international law , but does not reach the same standard under u.s. law , according to the study . examples of `` nonbinding '' documents include a u.s.-russia to remove syria 's stocks of chemical weapons and the proliferation security initiative to stop the global shipment of the weapons of mass destruction components . biden argued monday that this practice is as old as the united states itself . `` under presidents of both parties , such major shifts in american foreign policy as diplomatic recognition of the people 's republic of china , the resolution of the iran hostage crisis , and the conclusion of the vietnam war were all conducted without congressional approval , '' he said in his statement opposing the gop letter . the white house would clearly prefer a binding agreement with iran , which would have a better chance of longevity . but the strength of opposition in congress makes that route impossible . according to republicans such as cotton , the only deal the senate would approve is one that completely bans iranian uranium enrichment . obama has said that goal is simply not realistic . so republicans , dissatisfied with what 's emerging from negotiations , are seizing on the vulnerability of a deal that lacks treaty status . many see that as a more viable path for disruption than the case on administration overreach . `` if congress does n't approve this deal , congress wo n't accept this deal , now or in the future , '' cotton told cnn . in the letter , he informed iranian leaders that many senators will serve terms longer than obama , so they would have to reckon with the senate at some point . lawmakers can refuse to lift sanctions down the road or try to choke off funds for the deal 's implementation . the administration acknowledges that congress will have to get involved at some point . obama currently has the power to lift or waive certain sanctions against iran for the duration of his presidency and encourage u.s. international partners to follow suit . but he does not have the power to lift sanctions imposed by congress , which include some of the most punitive measures against iran . `` part of the agreement is going to involve sanctions relief to the iranian government that is meted out over time , '' deputy national security adviser ben rhodes told cnn . `` at some time in the duration of this agreement , congress will have to be heard on sanctions relief . '' senior u.s. officials have acknowledged that the clamor among lawmakers for a role , as well as their public criticisms , also implicitly highlights the vulnerability of their case and an ultimate agreement . tim kaine , a democratic senator from virginia who has signed onto a bill calling for the white house to put any deal up for a vote in congress , said that obama is within his rights to do what he is doing -- up to a point . `` it is not a treaty . if it were a treaty , there is a clear process . it would require a two-thirds vote in the senate . '' but kaine told cnn on wednesday that lawmakers did have a role to play at the point when sanctions mandated by congress are bargained away to ensure iran sticks to limits on its nuclear program . `` congress has got to weigh in at some point , '' kaine said .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- top gear presenter jeremy clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer , the bbc reported on wednesday . the bbc said clarkson , one of the corporation 's highest earners , had `` a fracas with a bbc producer '' in a statement released yesterday . `` jeremy clarkson has been suspended pending an investigation , '' they said . `` no one else has been suspended . top gear will not be broadcast this sunday . '' the bbc reported that the next two episodes , and possibly the third and final show of the series , will not be aired . fans of the presenter expressed dismay at the decision . at the time of writing , more than 300,000 people have signed a petition seeking his reinstatement . using the hashtag #bringbackclarkson , which is trending worldwide , some twitter users lamented that the show would not be the same without him . clarkson himself also took to twitter , posting an apology -lrb- of sorts -rrb- to labour leader ed miliband -- for knocking him down the news agenda . `` save clarkson ? '' his co-host james may tweeted . `` save empty cardboard boxes and off-cuts of string . they 're far more useful . '' but a `` sack jeremy clarkson '' petition is also doing the rounds , gathering 2,814 signatures so far . some will be glad to see the back of him . former cnn host piers morgan , who has had a series of run-ins with the presenter , also waded in with a cheeky jibe . this is not the first time that clarkson has been at the center of controversy . in may last year , the television presenter asked forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show . clarkson had mumbled the n-word while reciting a children 's nursery rhyme , but that version of the take was never aired . last year , the bbc show hit the headlines when argentina complained about a `` top gear '' special filmed in the country in which the number plate h982 fkl was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 falklands war . forced to stop filming and leave the country , clarkson said on the bbc newsbeat website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental . top gear was named as the world 's most widely watched factual program in the guinness world record 2013 edition book , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide . in a previous article on their website , the bbc said `` jeremy clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion . '' in their statement , the corporation declined to comment any further .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- this week , google cfo patrick pichette made headlines when his resignation memo announcing his retirement surfaced in the media . but the uproar was n't that pichette was quitting so much as why . `` after nearly seven years as cfo , '' he began , `` i will be retiring from google to spend more time with my family . '' what he wanted now was to enjoy life at home and abroad with his wife , to `` grab our backpacks and hit the road -- celebrate our last 25 years together by turning the page and enjoy a perfectly fine midlife crisis full of bliss and beauty . '' the letter , which he said he wrote in part because , `` so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life , '' has been held up as a manifesto for the `` work/life balance '' ideal that 's become something of the new american dream . the media has described it as `` powerful '' and `` unusually reflective . '' google co-founder and ceo larry page said , `` well worth reading , it will warm your heart . '' but if pichette 's work/life balance was achieved by quitting his job to go see the world , what message does it send to the rest of us seeking work/life balance ? what message does it send to those workers -- and in particular women -- who are constantly told they can `` have it all , '' or who can be at the top of their field and have a family ? what does it say to all those women to whom we say that , with a little `` leaning in '' or `` playing big '' they do n't have to choose between work and life ? successful women from sheryl sandberg to pepsico ceo indra nooyi have spoken out about the pressure to `` have it all , '' and how , perhaps , there 's really no such thing . research backs them up . a november 2014 study published in the journal of health and social behavior found that women show more signs of depression as they move up the career ladder . similarly , a survey of harvard business school grads found that the pressure women put on themselves to balance work and family is causing them significant stress . the survey also found that the majority of men expected their partners to take primary responsibility for childcare -- and indeed that happened in more than 70 % of cases . and yet in recent years , `` work/life balance '' has been held up as a legitimately attainable ideal , one that you can achieve if only you give your personal life as much attention as your professional one . but if you look at those we tend to hold up as models of that ideal -- those who leave work earlier , silence their cellphones more , retire , as in the case of pichette , at 52 -- are they really striking a balance ? which is why talking about work/life balance at all is a perilous business , an invitation to fail . having it all is very difficult , if not downright impossible . pichette , after all , did not practice work/life balance . he wrote , `` i was always on -- even when i was not supposed to be . '' like many successful men -lrb- and women -rrb- , he was likely able to work as hard as he did while still having a family because he had the support of someone at home . `` when our kids are asked by their friends about the success of the longevity of our marriage , they simply joke that tamar and i have spent so little time together that ` it 's really too early to tell ' if our marriage will in fact succeed . '' it 's in jest , of course , and yet likely rooted in some serious reality . this is a man who did n't achieve work/life balance as an executive . of course , one could argue that the idea of balancing work with life may be harder for men than for women , who are the traditional breadwinners and the ones more likely to find self-worth through their work . this is one reason we see many wealthy , powerful men working well into their 80s . at the same time , it 's undeniably easier for these men to make a decision to leave the whole thing early . pichette retires as google 's highest paid executive , with millions in stock incentives . he can afford to retire and not even have to work for the remainder of his life . the rest of us are nowhere close to having that luxury of choice . corporate america , it should be noted , shoulders much of the blame for keeping balance at arm 's length , with increasingly long days and ever-tightening limits on vacations , paid leave and other `` benefits . '' we should n't have to leave our jobs to achieve balance , and the fact that some do , means that companies need to make real changes . that includes staffing workplaces reasonably , putting workers ' well-being on par with profits , showing workers you do n't expect them to be `` on '' all the time . only then will real work / life balance start to take shape . until then : `` google cfo patrick pichette 's goodbye note will make you dream of quitting your job , '' so reads a headline at abc news . indeed , that 's the kicker . pichette can `` carpe diem '' and `` find balance , '' if that 's what he 's doing , at 52 , because he truly does have choices . but for most of the workers in america , finding that sort of balance -- or choosing life over work -- will remain an impossible dream .
jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- either benjamin netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in israeli history and beyond , or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election . polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger , isaac herzog of the zionist union party . only four days before the election , polls showed herzog taking a four-seat lead into the final weekend before the election . exit polls on the night of the election showed netanyahu had closed the gap . the polls suggested he was in a dead heat , with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties . then came the results . not more polls or surveys , but actual counts from the ballot boxes . netanyahu was n't in a fight for his political life after all . he was the clear winner , running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government . although the results are unofficial , it seems almost certain that netanyahu will remain the israeli prime minister . avi degani , a pollster , professor at tel aviv university and president of the geocartography knowledge group , saw very different results from his own polls . he never anticipated a zionist union victory . instead , he says , he always saw likud holding a lead . the mistake that others made , according to degani , was in the methodology . `` the internet does not represent the state of israel and the people of israel , '' he said , referring to modern statistical methods . `` it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- tel aviv , better-educated , more participants in this kind of conversation . and people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote likud , i think , are poorly represented . '' `` i have tested sometimes at the same night , doing by telephone as i do always -- and very specifically geographically , and very well-weighted and very well , having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time i did on the internet . and i got results which are very , very different . '' but mina tzemach , the polling expert for cnn affiliate channel 2 israel , suggests netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap `` like a magician , '' using the election polls as his final trick . `` the polls showed that they are going to lose . it gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians . netanyahu used it , '' said tzemach . `` many voted what we call strategic voting . they did not vote to the party that is their first preference , but they voted for the likud . '' likud voters did not participate in exit polls , according to tzemach , and that skewed the results , leading many to believe that herzog had tied netanyahu . `` we had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former soviet union , '' explained tzemach . `` in these ballots , more than 30 % did not participate in our polls , and they are likud supporters . '' another factor that may have worked in netanyahu 's favor was his likud party cannibalizing votes from other right-wing parties . in the days before the election , netanyahu moved to the political right , making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties , such as naftali bennett 's jewish home party and avigdor lieberman 's yisrael beiteinu party . during the weekend before the election , netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in tel aviv 's central rabin square . he continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election . his most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution . `` anyone who is going to establish a palestinian state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israel , '' he said in a television interview . `` this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years . '' in 2009 , in a speech known as the bar ilan speech , netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution , saying , `` let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions . israel is committed to international agreements , and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations . i say to the palestinians : we want to live with you in peace , quiet , and good neighborly relations . '' tzemach estimates that likud took four seats from jewish home and two more seats from yachad , a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the knesset , israel 's parliament . exit polls in israel have been wrong before . in the most recent elections in 2013 , exit polls showed yair lapid 's centrist yesh atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the knesset . but when the final results were tallied , lapid won 19 seats , becoming a major player in the government . this time , the unexpected surprise worked in netanyahu 's favor , turning the campaign race into an election night rout . likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats , but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee based on 99 % of the vote . netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before . in the 1996 elections , early results showed the labor party 's shimon peres as the winner , but as more results came in , netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1 % of the votes . degani said this election reveals the truth behind israeli politics . `` this last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left . we have only right and extreme right , which is not nice sometimes . and in the right , you have the likud mostly , and in the likud , you have mostly netanyahu .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- new zealand police have revealed a threat to contaminate infant formula and other dairy formula with poison , in an apparent attempt to blackmail the government over its pest control policies . police appealed for public help to find the alleged blackmailer , at a press conference in wellington tuesday . they revealed an investigation had been underway since november , when anonymous letters were sent to giant dairy cooperative fonterra and a farmers ' lobby group . the letters were accompanied by small packages of milk powder containing a concentrated form of 1080 -lrb- sodium fluoroacetate -rrb- , a poison used by new zealand 's department of conservation to control introduced pest species such as possums and rats . the letters threatened to contaminate infant and other formula with 1080 unless new zealand stopped using the poison for pest control by the end of march , police said in a statement . the letters said the threat would be made public if the demand was not met . new zealand 's heavy use of 1080 -- it uses about 80 % of the world 's manufactured stocks , according the country 's environmental protection agency -- has been a controversial issue , with conservationists and farmers generally supporting the measure , and some hunters and animal rights activists opposed . primary industries minister nathan guy said the threat amounted to `` eco-terrorism . '' prime minister john key said at a press conference that police had advised that there was a low likelihood of the threat being carried out . meanwhile , government officials said supplies of formula had not been contaminated , and urged consumers to continue using the products . `` we are confident that new zealand infant and other formula is just as safe today as it was before this threat was made , '' said scott gallacher , deputy director-general of the ministry for primary industries . `` people should keep using it as they always have . '' he said more than 40,000 samples had been taken without finding a trace of 1080 , and food security measures had also been boosted in response . these included a strengthened security measures in retail stores and a boosted presence at manufacturing sites , and enhanced milk and product testing , including the introduction of a test for 1080 . `` this criminal threat is designed to cause fear in order to generate a political outcome . it is using food as a vehicle but should not undermine confidence in our world-class food safety system or in any manufacturer , '' he said . he urged consumers to check formula packaging for any signs of tampering as a result of the threat . police said an auckland-based investigation team was pursuing a number of lines of inquiry in locating the source of the threat , but the time was right to appeal to the public . `` whilst there is a possibility that this threat is a hoax , we must treat the threat seriously and a priority investigation is underway , '' said deputy commissioner mike clement . `` you might be aware of someone who has strong views on the 1080 issue and made threats , or has discussed how to access supplies of 1080 . '' he also called on the alleged blackmailer to come forward . `` the letter writer may not have really considered the implications of their actions when this communication was drafted . now is the time to put this right by picking up the phone and calling us . '' blackmail carries a maximum sentence of 14 years jail in new zealand . new zealand is the world 's leading dairy exporter , and dairy cooperative fonterra is the country 's biggest company , with revenue of $ 16.3 billion last year . ceo theo spierings described the threat in a press conference as `` a despicable crime . '' the global diary giant has been beset by problems before , most recently in 2013 , when it ordered a global recall of products -- including infant formula -- after fears they might contain bacteria that could cause botulism . the fears proved unfounded , as the bacteria detected was not a botulism-causing strain . new zealand infant formula exporters association chairman michael barnett said eyes were now on the response to the threat in key markets such as china , the biggest consumer of new zealand dairy exports . `` this could be extremely damaging for new zealand 's exports offshore , '' he told cnn affiliate tvnz . `` our whole reputation as an exporter of food is at risk because of this nutter . '' trading in all new zealand-listed dairy companies was halted tuesday with the announcement of the threat . cnn 's charles riley contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world of mexican wrestling wrestling has been deeply shaken by the death of star fighter hijo del perro aguayo , who collapsed after being kicked during a bout . the lucha libre fighter , whose real name is pedro aguayo ramirez , was left slumped against the ropes after a flying kick from one of his opponents , rey mysterio , during the match friday night . the other wrestlers continued with the fight as aguayo 's limp body slid down onto the mat , according to video footage of the bout posted on social media . the video showed ringside personnel repeatedly shaking aguayo and talking to him without any response . he eventually received medical attention and was rushed out of the arena in the city of tijuana . but doctors were unable to revive him . aaa , the wrestling promotion company for which aguayo worked , said it was informed of his death around 1 a.m. saturday . he was 35 years old . `` mexican lucha libre is in mourning over the death of one of its star talents , '' the aaa said in a statement . questions remained over what exactly caused aguayo 's death and why it took so long for him to receive medical treatment . ernesto franco , the duty doctor at the fight , told mexico 's state news agency notimex that at the time of aguayo 's collapse , he was attending to other injured wrestlers , according to cnn mexico . franco said aguayo 's injury was the result of a blow to the neck region , adding that he spent about an hour trying to revive him using `` all possible resuscitation measures . '' the associated press reported that the state prosecutor 's office has opened an investigation into possible manslaughter . the aaa said friday 's fight was organized by another promotion company named the crash . aguayo 's death prompted an outpouring of grief on social media from fans and members of the wrestling industry . `` i will miss you and carry you with me for the rest of my life , '' tweeted rey mysterio , who landed the flying kick on aguayo . `` rest in peace , hijo del perro . '' he posted two images on instagram that appeared to show him and aguayo at a young age and again later in life . `` i had the privilege to share a ring for the first time with hijo del perro aguayo in his debut as a professional wrestler and an honor to be in the ring with this great legend for the last time ! '' he wrote . `` you will be missed , perro . '' wwe wrestler mark henry tweeted , `` respect to fallen brother in arms ! '' `` i and the wwe universe pray for your peace and comfort to your family ! '' henry wrote . aguayo is the son of one of the giants of mexican wrestling , pedro `` perro '' aguayo . the younger aguayo began his career in 1995 at the age 15 , according to the aaa . but he emerged from his father 's shadow to become a big name in his own right . `` el hijo del perro aguayo was among the most decorated aaa stars in recent memory as a three-time mexican national tag team champion as well as a former mexican national light heavyweight champion and mexican national atomicos champion , '' wrote bleacher report columnist mike chiari . `` there is no question that el hijo del perro aguayo was among the most popular and successful luchadores in mexico , '' chiari said .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- sigma alpha epsilon is under fire for a video showing party-bound fraternity members singing a racist chant . sae 's national chapter suspended the students , but university of oklahoma president david boren took it a step further , saying the university 's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done . the news is shocking , but it 's not the first time sae has faced controversy . sae was founded march 9 , 1856 , at the university of alabama , five years before the american civil war , according to the fraternity website . when the war began , the group had fewer than 400 members , of which `` 369 went to war for the confederate states and seven for the union army , '' the website says . the fraternity now boasts more than 200,000 living alumni , along with about 15,000 undergraduates populating 219 chapters and 20 `` colonies '' seeking full membership at universities . sae has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths , many blamed on the hazing of new recruits , sae national president bradley cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity 's website . the fraternity 's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for `` health and safety incidents '' since 2010 . at least 30 of the incidents involved hazing , and dozens more involved alcohol . however , the list is missing numerous incidents from recent months . among them , according to various media outlets : yale university banned the saes from campus activities last month after members allegedly tried to interfere with a sexual misconduct investigation connected to an initiation rite . stanford university in december suspended sae housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content . and johns hopkins university in november suspended the fraternity for underage drinking . `` the media has labeled us as the ` nation 's deadliest fraternity , ' '' cohen said . in 2011 , for example , a student died while being coerced into excessive alcohol consumption , according to a lawsuit . sae 's previous insurer dumped the fraternity . `` as a result , we are paying lloyd 's of london the highest insurance rates in the greek-letter world , '' cohen said . universities have turned down sae 's attempts to open new chapters , and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson is crumbling . the cowardly and reprehensible shooting wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the missouri town , which had already seen ferguson police chief thomas jackson announce his resignation after a damning justice department report on its police department . the report , which was ordered in the wake of the killing of michael brown last year , highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased , prejudiced and that has regularly targeted , arrested and fined african-americans . residents understandably want justice . but what 's worse in all this is that ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities . it 's a combustible mix . in three-quarters of all u.s. cities with populations 50,000 or more , the police presence is `` disproportionately white relative to the local population , '' according to the washington post . and tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons , and stipulations that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition . all this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across america . indeed , a wholesale review of policies and approaches to law enforcement is needed , something that will likely necessitate drastic reforms in some departments so they can better represent , integrate , problem solve and liaise with the communities they are serving . first and foremost , our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation , whether it be race , creed , sexual orientation and more . america is changing fast , but police departments are n't keeping up . training and recruitment of minorities is critical , yet far more needs to be taking place . with this in mind , amplifying community policing models that work and scaling them up immediately is essential if we are to stem the growing and sometimes overwhelming tide of frustration , anger and cynicism welling up among young african , asian and hispanic americans . second , we must radically rethink the trend toward the indiscriminate procurement and use of surplus military grade weaponry , which under the department of defense 's 1033 program is flowing from battlefields to our local police forces . when the weapons of war come home from iraq and afghanistan to help police america 's cities and towns , then you know something has gone terribly wrong with this country . mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles , tanks , drones , grenades and assault weapons should not replace the community policing of our main streets . ferguson is an excellent example of how the deployment of heavy weaponry inflames rather than de-escalates a crisis situation . having military equipment on our streets does not make citizens feel safer , which is why the stop militarizing law enforcement act was recently reintroduced in congress . we do not need our officers looking like `` robocop '' when they patrol our streets . it 's that simple . yet until such a bill is passed , war weapons will continue to flood our streets ; congress must act to stem this tide . we understand that times have changed and that new security threats require new solutions and procedures . but it does n't justify the 150 raids per day by special weapons and tactics units for incidents that can be as benign as a department of education warrant . this kind of aggressive approach does n't engender the kind of engagement necessary for identifying real risks lurking in a community . in fact , the opposite happens . intelligence opportunities are dead on arrival , and potential allies who would otherwise be ready to help shut down immediately . aggressive military-type action is quickly turning americans against fellow citizens who they are ostensibly there to serve and protect . we therefore trust that president barack obama and attorney general eric holder will take decisive action , working hand in hand with police departments all across this country . yes , the white house 's task force on police militarization was a start , but more concrete measures are needed if we want to reverse the rising anger in ferguson and elsewhere . the time for a change is now . if we do n't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities , then towns like ferguson will unravel further .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- an israeli arab man who is shown being shot by a child in a recent isis video has no connections to israeli intelligence , the country 's defense minister said wednesday . in the video released tuesday , isis claims the man , 19-year-old mohamed said ismail musallam , is an israeli spy . but israeli defense minister moshe ya'alon denied the allegation on israeli radio . the isis video shows musallam 's israeli passport and claims he 's an agent sent to infiltrate the group . musallam 's family on tuesday told cnn that he had no ties with the mossad , israel 's spy agency , and had , in fact , been recruited by isis . musallam is an israeli citizen of palestinian descent . `` mohamed told me and his brother that isis took him , '' according to said musallam , his father . `` they sent him money through the western union . they said you will have girls , money , cars , villas , paradise , but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing . '' it was n't long before musallam 's family members did n't recognize him when they talked to him on skype . the man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle . his father tried to help him get home , sending him money and even enlisting the red cross . but his son never made it back to israel . about a month ago , said musallam said , he was told his son was taken by isis when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border . a video posted tuesday on isis-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be musallam on his knees , wearing an orange jumpsuit . an adult isis fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him . the adult , speaking french , gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing . the child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots musallam in the forehead . the man immediately falls forward to the ground . the child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body . an issue last month of isis ' english-language propaganda magazine , dabiq , included a purported interview with musallam and described his alleged work for the israeli spy agency . in the isis video , musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession , saying he is an israeli intelligence agent working for mossad , sent to infiltrate isis . musallam 's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video , forced to lie about ties to israeli intelligence . `` mohamed is not an agent . mohamed does n't have a shekel . if he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life , '' his mother , hind musallam , said . `` we could have been living a different life and i would not be working cleaning houses so we can live . '' this is n't the first time isis has used children to drive home its message . an isis propaganda video released in january -- one that cnn could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head . the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high . last august , a photo posted to twitter from an isis stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , `` that 's my boy . '' isis has featured children as fighters before , calling them the `` cubs of the caliphate '' -lrb- the adult jihadis call each other `` lions '' -rrb- and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families . it has taken over schools to indoctrinate children . human rights watch says isis and other extremist groups `` have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- u.s. secretary of state john kerry said saturday that `` we need to close ... gaps '' with iran in talks about its nuclear program , adding that those negotiating with iranian officials `` are deeply committed to ensuring that iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon . '' iran faces a march 24 deadline to reach a deal about its nuclear program . several interim agreements have been made in recent months , though a long-term pact so far has been elusive . speaking in paris alongside french foreign minister laurent fabius , kerry said progress has been made `` but there remain gaps , divergences . '' he acknowledged `` the days are ticking by , '' but that does n't mean there 's an urgent rush to reach an agreement . `` we have to get the right deal , '' the top u.s. diplomat said . kerry said one thing all members of the p5 +1 group -- which consists of the united states , russia , china , the united kingdom and france , plus germany -- agree on is that it 's imperative iran does n't develop nuclear arms . iranian minister : some consider peace an ` existential threat ' officials in tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes , not to create atomic weaponry . `` we will find out whether or not ... iran 's prepared to take the steps to answer the questions that the world has a right to get answers to , '' kerry said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- by the time cynthia falardeau read about alex pring , a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer , she had made peace with her son wyatt 's limb difference . her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands . at a week old , doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand . they were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die . falardeau mourned her boy 's missing arm for years but , in time , embraced her son as he was . wyatt also learned to adapt . they tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months . `` his main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store , '' falardeau wrote on cnn ireport . in truth , she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary . so when a friend shared a story from the `` today show '' with wyatt in mind , about a team of university of central florida -lrb- ucf -rrb- students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus , falardeau was defensive . `` he does n't need this , '' she thought . her fifth-grader had a different reaction : `` i want one of these robot arms ! '' falardeau remembers wyatt telling her and her husband . `` i could ride a bike ! i might even be able to paddle a kayak ! '' there were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands . a proper somersault . clap with two hands . dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading . stuff she had n't really thought about but he clearly had . falardeau got in touch with the orlando students through e-nable , an online volunteer organization started by rochester institute of technology research scientist jon schull to match people who have 3-d printers with children in need of hands and arms . the organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at enablingthefuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $ 20 to $ 50 . middle and high school student groups and girl and boy scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free . the ucf team , which operates a nonprofit called limbitless solutions , is special because it 's the only group in the 3-d volunteer network making electronic arms . most 3-d arms are mechanical , which presents a challenge for children without elbows . with mechanical arms , the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow . the students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep . `` it 's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems . the first problem we solved was : how do we make the hand move electronically ? and then : how do we attach this arm to a child ? '' said sophomore tyler petresky . `` it 's just one problem after another we keep solving . that 's what engineering is all about . '' the centers for disease control and prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the united states are born with upper limb deformities each year . comprehensive statistics are n't available for the number of children with amputations , such as wyatt . the ucf project started when albert manero , an engineering doctoral student , heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-d printed hand . he got involved with e-nable and met alex , a local boy teased because of his missing arm , and set about designing a robotic replacement . they gave it to alex for free . `` my mother taught us that we 're supposed to help change the world , '' manero said at the time . `` we 're supposed to help make it better . '' the students were blown away by what happened after that . the `` today show '' and other national news outlets featured stories about alex and manero , and then they got international attention . families in more than 25 countries have asked the ucf students to help their children . in february , microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world . each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble . the students use the printer in the school 's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $ 350 -- through donations . petresky got involved with the design of pring 's hand because manero knew he was good with electronics . `` he bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches . i went over to his house and helped him out with electronics , '' he said . `` i found out he was working on an arm , and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world . '' eventually manero moved to germany for a fulbright scholarship and left petresky in charge of running the operations in orlando . petresky says they ask every family about the child 's favorite color , superhero and interests , so the new limb can `` not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them . '' as they 've designed the bionics , they 've learned that kids do n't necessarily want to blend in . children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes , disney 's `` frozen , '' and in wyatt 's case , the blue-skinned men from `` blue man group . '' for christmas , the group upgraded alex 's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling optimus prime from `` transformers . '' `` we quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal , and much more about expressing yourself , '' petresky said . `` there 's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative . '' the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including wyatt . he traveled with his mom to ucf last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close . he expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month . his mom , cynthia , was most excited about seeing wyatt being celebrated for who he is . `` the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money ca n't buy . he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself , '' she wrote in her ireport . `` wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children . '' as they got ready to leave the campus , her son told her he ca n't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm . and someday , he said , he wants to go to ucf and help other kids like him .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as a controversy over a racist video continues , the university of oklahoma is announcing a plan to hire a vice president who will oversee diversity programs . a video of a racist chant by the university 's now-disbanded sigma alpha epsilon fraternity made headlines nationwide this week . it shows students on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , `` there will never be a ni **** sae . you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . there will never be a ni **** sae . '' in announcing the new position wednesday night , university president david boren said he decided to make the hire two months ago -- before the video came to light -- and is in talks with an african-american candidate . the school newspaper and a student organization publicized the nine-second video clip after receiving it via anonymous messages . shortly after it surfaced , the university cut ties with sigma alpha epsilon , as did the national fraternity . two students spotted in the video , parker rice and levi pettit , have been expelled for their alleged leadership role in the chant . `` i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night . it was wrong and reckless , '' rice said tuesday in a statement to the dallas morning news . `` i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same . '' a statement from pettit 's parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to african-americans , students and university faculty . `` he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting . while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist , '' brody and susan pettit said . cnn has reached out to both students . a spokesman for the pettit family confirmed that levi pettit was in the video but declined cnn 's request for an interview . boren has ordered a shutdown of the fraternity house in norman , and said it was no longer affiliated with the university . `` livid , just extremely heartbroken , '' jay vinekar , a founder of the university 's sae chapter , told cnn affiliate ktrk . `` i do n't want it in my house , and i do n't want those people to wear my letters , claiming to represent me . the problem is not just a couple of guys on that bus , the problem is that house , it 's a cancer that needs to be cut out . '' local sae alumni apologized on behalf of other members , saying the fraternity has had problems for years . `` the ou sae board of trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the ou chapter of sae three to four years ago , and was not immediately and totally stopped , '' the organization said in a statement wednesday . `` it should have been . '' the fraternity said it is investigating other incidents involving other chapters that were brought to the attention of its national office . it 's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video . boren has said the fraternity wo n't return during his tenure if he can help it . cnn 's alina machado , tristan smith and steve almasy contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new , more inspiring politics , this past week has been deeply discouraging . in two key moments , leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the bourbons of france , who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past . the first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by republican senators to the iranian regime . the second , and perhaps more important politically telling moment , was hillary clinton 's handling of her emails . the two cases are oddly related . in both instances , the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse . in both cases , the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency . both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today 's ugly politics . republicans in congress have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with iran enter the home stretch . they , like many others -- including a sizable number of democrats , the current israeli government , and friendly arab nations -- fear the obama administration will cut a weak , leaky deal that will allow iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons . just as importantly , republicans believe , with cause , that as he negotiates , president barack obama has tried to sideline congress in general and them in particular . who can blame them for arguing that if the president insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by congress -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions ? their basic concerns were not unreasonable . thus , if they had sent exactly the same letter to the president , they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and statecraft . instead , they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of iran , leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the president . we have had renegade members of congress try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember sen. jesse helms ? -- but never 47 members of the united states senate tossing a hand grenade into delicate , life-or-death negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the united states . ayatollah khamenei made clear this week that he may use the republican letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal . where do we go then ? will talks collapse ? will an iranian rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race , starting in saudi arabia , which is already taking preliminary steps ? will the united states then be compelled to use military force against iran ? who knows for sure ? what we do know is that iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the republican nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard , unyielding line . one can just imagine a number of gop candidates pledging that if elected , they will abolish obamacare on day 1 and an iranian agreement on day 2 . this is hardly a way to restore steady , bipartisan foreign policies , as we so badly need . and why have republicans forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last gop president was too hard line and reckless ? on the other side of the aisle , hillary clinton had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state . as one who spent a year and a half at the clinton white house and state department , i could see first hand how they -- more than any president since nixon -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize . it is small wonder that both clintons still have scar tissue . hillary clinton 's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system . no , they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the state department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt , air-tight basis . that did not break laws . but it did run afoul of government procedures and , when revealed , naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding . in her press conference , she did accomplish her obvious mission : she began cutting legs off the story . in essence , she said one half of her emails -lrb- the official ones -rrb- are now safely with the state department and , at her request , will gradually be made public . the other half -lrb- who knows what 's in there ? -rrb- have been deleted and she is keeping the server . in effect , she says , they are gone ... and gone forever , beyond congressional subpoena , foia requests , and even hackers . what fresh revelations can the press now pursue ? not many . and how can republicans browbeat her in hearings without looking like bullies ? hard to do . in short , the story may soon die . you just have to trust me , she says . clever . but the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral , trusted party like lee hamilton to review all the emails , she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price : she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules . loyal democrats will continue to invest their faith in her , but for many others , the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease . and polarization deepens . she was always going to face a rough campaign , but now she will begin with clouds already gathering . more to the point , they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader . around the world , many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment . and she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation : 22.9 million were created in the eight clinton years , more than in any other presidency since world war ii -lrb- reagan was second at 16.1 million ; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six obama years . -rrb- . in short , she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are american politics . bill clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right . but candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday . after this last week , they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian barbara tuchman published some 30 years ago : `` the march of folly : from troy to vietnam . '' there she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path , stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck . tuchman calls their refusal to learn from experience `` wooden-headedness '' . we have seen too much wooden-headedness these past days .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i grew up watching `` leave it to beaver . '' most episodes , ward cleaver would come home from work in his suit and tie and there would be his wife june , always in the kitchen , her apron as white as the picket fence outside . june made dinner , of course , and ward and wally and the beav sat at the table and ate . as i recall , june usually cleaned up . maybe once or twice the boys helped with dishes . maybe . i would watch the black and white show during dinner , sitting on the couch with a plate of food on my lap that had not been prepared by my own mother . my mother was in her generation 's first cohort of `` working moms . '' she had a successful career as an executive at at&t and then lucent technologies . she left for work early each morning , but was always home by five or six -- in time to spend time with me , not to cook . my dad also had a full-time job , and across the entirety of my life , i do n't recall him so much as opening a can of soup . he 's only recently learned to use the microwave . both my parents worked equally hard , but there was no doubt when i was growing up that cooking was my mom 's responsibility -- even if that meant buying prepared meals from the allentown farmer 's market , spooning it onto plates , pressing `` power '' then `` start . '' in other words , as i ate my dinner in the 1980s while watching a tv show based on life in the 1950s , it was easy to see that some things had changed and some had not . life inside the house -- food , dishes , cleaning , tidying , clothing , hygiene -- was my mom 's responsibility , just as it was june cleaver 's . outside the house -- the lawn , the cars , anything made or stored in the garage , sports , bike riding -- that was my dad 's domain . and to be clear , when the car would break down , it was a big deal , but one that came up far less frequently than our need for meals and laundry . this daily labor weighed more on my mother . sociologist arlie russell hochschild coined this the `` second shift '' : how even though more and more women started working outside the home , they were still expected to do the same amount of domestic work at the end of the day . studies say that when it comes to fair division of household labor , gay couples , like my partner and i , generally do a better job . unfettered by the ready expectations of traditional gender roles , same-sex couples `` are more likely than members of heterosexual couples to negotiate a balance between achieving a fair distribution of household labor and accommodating the different interests , skills , and work schedules of particular partners , '' wrote social scientist lawrence k. kurdek . in fact , after a no-doubt bumpy period of adjustment -lrb- editorializing from personal experience here -rrb- , kurdek wrote , `` this pattern of negotiation holds true even when couples have children living with them . '' in my own family , my partner does most of the laundry , though to be fair that 's partly because she 's picky about what 's washed on what cycle and what gets hung to dry , versus tossed in the dryer . on weekends , she does most of the cooking -- because , she 's a better cook and enjoys it more . but i 'm faster , so i end up cooking breakfast and dinner most of the weekdays . about 99 % of the time , if our bed is made it 's because sarah did it . and 99 % of the time , if the dishes are washed , it 's because i washed them . sarah likes to buy groceries because i have a bad habit of buying massive quantities of things we do n't need . and she buys our daughter 's clothing -lrb- same reason -rrb- . i pay the bills and do our taxes . on weekends and after school we take turns ferrying our 6-year-old to and from activities and play dates . what , you 're wondering , about other traditional `` male '' gender roles in our male-less family ? admittedly , i more often wear pants more than my partner and i more often take on these tasks . when our car breaks , i take it to the mechanic . i load the car up for trips . i put crap in the basement . i smush millipedes . i fix the leaky sink . but i also sew my daughter 's halloween costume every year and sew on buttons when they fall off . our same-sex family has not so much created new gender role arrangements , but deconstructed such arrangements altogether . i get to smush millipedes and sew costumes , not because of my chromosomes or some pre-determined gender role , but because i enjoy doing so . while i now pay most of our bills online , i find it unbelievably gratifying to put a check in the actual mail . i have a giant , eclectic pile of postage stamps for this reason . it should be noted that the experience of gender roles is highly defined by class . what my partner and i have in common with my parents is the financial ability to have additional help , including , in our case , regular babysitters and a weekly house cleaner . what 's more , any conversation about household gender roles would be incomplete without noting that some upper-middle class americans pay their domestic workers so painfully little that these workers -- predominantly immigrant women of color -- ca n't afford to put healthy food on their own families ' tables , if they even have time to cook between cobbling jobs together to make ends meet . meanwhile studies show that in working-class straight couples , even where the women work outside the home and the men do n't , women still do a disproportionate amount of housework . it seems that in too many situations , no matter the configuration , women are getting screwed . this is partly why leanin.org today launched #leanintogether , a public service campaign in partnership with the national basketball association and the women 's national basketball association emphasizing how men benefit from equality and providing practical tips for men to do their part at home and at work . the campaign encourages men to `` show the world they 're for equality '' and women to `` celebrate men leaning in for equality '' by posting with the hashtag #leanintogether . patriarchy is not the fault of all men , but it is the responsibility of all men to do something about it . after all , whether you want to blame biology or early economic incentives or the cultural indoctrination of `` leave it to beaver , '' men have consistently failed to do their fair share of household labor in america . the solution ? more gay households or even sister-wife-type scenarios alone wo n't transform household gender roles . we have to value household work as work , which means everything from paying domestic workers livable wages to more men cleaning and cooking and teaching their sons that doing so is honorable and equitable , not demeaning . while fairness in gender roles has improved since the era of june and ward , the subtle and not-so-subtle inequities are still a mess . men need to shift from expecting or enforcing traditional gender roles to becoming role models for more equitable relationships . in other words , clean it up , fellas -- literally and figuratively .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- this weekend marked the official opening of `` fish in the dark , '' the broadway debut of larry david of `` seinfeld '' and `` curb your enthusiasm '' fame . of course , the odd conventions of live theater mean that `` fish '' was n't quite fresh-to-table at its premiere : it 's been playing for several weeks now to sold-out preview crowds , to build buzz and iron out production kinks . and sold out really means sold out : the show has destroyed box office records for the vintage cort theatre and might yet set new ones for a nonmusical despite its limited run . that 's because david has a huge built-in audience for his unique brand of humor , which `` curb '' fans know to be as abrasive as sea salt and as astringent as lemon , unyielding in the face of social niceties , epic humiliation or even common human decency . it 's polarizing , and the poles are pretty clearly drawn : by and large , fans of david 's work tend to loudly proclaim that as long as abuse is sprayed pari passu -- e.g. , proportionately in all directions -- no one should take offense . the nonfans tend to respond that this kind of comedy rests on an assumption defined by another common latin phrase , ceteris paribus -- e.g. , `` all other things being equal . '' and all other things are never equal in our world , by definition . when a group of affluent white protagonists in an almost exclusively white `` new york '' behave badly toward a handful of cartoonish parodies of working-class ethnic nobodies -lrb- a pretty fair synopsis of many `` seinfeld '' episodes -rrb- , it 's hilarious if you belong to the former category . it 's much less so when you belong to the latter . so it 's not entirely surprising that some of the whispered early concerns with `` fish '' related to the character of fabiana , the puerto rican maid of the late patriarch of david 's fictional family , the drexels . fabiana , played by rosie perez , and her son diego play a pivotal part in the show , which takes place in the immediate wake -lrb- er , shiva ? -rrb- of the passing of the elder drexel ; without spoiling the plot , suffice it to say that it hinges on upstairs-downstairs romantic antics and their inevitable consequences . and yes , some reviewers are using the `` r '' - word in calling out the depiction of fabiana , eye-rolling over yashdasm -lrb- yet another stereotypical hispanic domestic and single mom -rrb- whose comic function is largely to mispronounce words and make cultural stumbles like bringing cuchifritos to a jewish memorial service . but the conversation about race and representation is n't , and should n't be , absolutist based on content ; context is just as important -- perhaps more so . what 's the threeway balance of power between the author , the actors and the intended audience ? are a performance 's questionable aspects racially exceptionalized ? does the role pivot on the ethnic identity of the characters and performers in a way that prevents them from being seen as more than just the color of their skin and the accent of their speech ? and finally , is the vehicle in which it 's taking place innovative , eye-opening , horizon-expanding , or does it reduce , repress and restrict ? as `` fish '' was finishing its preview run , a theater-world drama of another color was erupting nearby . the national asian artists project , a nonprofit theater company that produces works from the traditional broadway canon featuring all-asian casts , had announced its next production would be a big-budget , asian american adaptation of jerome kern and oscar hammerstein ii 's `` show boat , '' to be developed and directed by broadway wunderkind tommy tune . the problem , as asian american actor and blogger erin quill immediately called out , is that unlike naap 's prior projects , which have included shows such as `` oliver ! '' and `` carousel , '' `` show boat '' is set in the deep south , among the laborers and performers working on and about the cotton blossom , a paddleboat theater offering entertainment to audiences up and down the mississippi . `` this show ... is about the great racial divides within the deep south -- divides that are , without question , black and white , '' wrote quill . '' -lsb- asians -rsb- were not ` toting that barge ' or ` lifting that bale ' . asian americans were not recovering from being ripped from their homeland and bound in chains due to the color of their skin . it is not ` our ' story to tell . '' the fundamental mission of naap and other theatrical companies that cast productions against type is twofold : they seek to showcase overlooked talent and to challenge the racial conventions of the aptly dubbed `` great white way , '' disrupting the notion that phenotypic reference points are necessary for a performer to believably portray a role . in that latter context , they 're exercises designed to highlight the fundamental magic of live theater : its power to get audiences to suspend disbelief . naap 's all-asian `` show boat '' would seem to be not very different from the public theater 's present production of `` hamilton , '' featuring a multiracial set of american founding fathers -- including puerto rican author and composer lin-manuel miranda as the titular hamilton and african american actor leslie odom jr. as his rival , aaron burr . and yet , there is a fundamental difference . having actors of color play characters written for white actors , who are cast in 79 % of all broadway roles -lrb- by contrast , asian americans and hispanics are cast in just 3 % each and african americans in 14 % -rrb- , is an act of disruptive defiance . having actors of color play characters written for other actors of color is shuffling deck chairs on the titanic at best and at worst , a categorically ill-conceived recipe for insensitivity . could naap have weathered the spectacle of asian performers speaking in southern black dialect , performing a plot that 's entirely dependent on black history ? could an asian steve have cut an asian julie 's hand , sucking her blood , then declared defiantly to an asian sheriff that if julie was a `` mulatto , '' so was he , because he now had `` black blood '' in him ? after a contentious town hall , in which numerous other performers of varied race and background expressed their vehement doubts , the asian american theatrical community , and ultimately naap as well , decided it could n't . the context of the show , and the charged climate it would be arriving in , would make its content impossible to swallow . naap canceled the production . the costs of the cancellation are n't known , but they clearly are n't insignificant . but what , by contrast , of `` fish '' ? the reality is that fabiana -lrb- performed by rosie perez more or less as rosie perez -rrb- does n't stand out as offensive when compared with the rest of the play 's characters ; for that matter , there 's nothing inherently hispanic about the role , which , if the show had an unlimited run , could easily be recast as asian , black or white , losing very little in the process . by contrast , nearly all of the rest of the cast fit familiar comedic portrayals of jewish family members -- most intensely so , the neurotic protagonist , norman -lrb- performed by larry david himself more or less as larry david -rrb- . the truth is , if non-jews were to put on a production of `` fish in the dark , '' it would be difficult not to experience it as anti-semitic . these are the new and fascinating challenges presented by pop culture in our era of surging diversity , and they 're coming fast and furious from every direction . interesting times and sure to get more interesting still .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a video appears online . in it , fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful , racist song about lynching african-americans . the video goes viral . you 're president of the university . imagine being in that situation . what would you do ? there are two ways to answer the question . the first is in the moment of crisis . the second is about the long term . as most everyone knows by now , david boren , president of the university of oklahoma , faced just this situation monday . and i 've been thinking about it intensely , not only because i care about race and civic leadership in america , but also because boren was my first boss , when he was a u.s. senator . i 'm not from oklahoma but ended up working for boren through a college internship . he was a mentor to me during my years in washington , and a model for me when he left the beltway to be of greater use and service as an educator . though we have n't talked since the crisis broke , i see familiar patterns of leadership . boren responded to the crisis swiftly , with a statement that went viral . boren told the students from sigma alpha epsilon -lrb- sae -rrb- he had a message for them : `` you are disgraceful . you have violated all that we stand for . you should not have the privilege of calling yourselves sooners '' -lrb- the ou nickname -rrb- . boren went on to sever all ties between ou and sae . the national fraternity closed the local chapter . later , boren said he 'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because `` we do n't provide student services for bigots . '' the next day he expelled two of them . his actions have resonated across the country . on social media , people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by boren 's response . why ? because he did something rare in public life today . he expressed a decisive , judgmental view with moral clarity . then he followed through . his statements have been free of mushy lawyer-talk or euphemism . he 's led authentically , from the heart . of course , people have carped . some question whether boren has the legal authority , as head of a public institution , to expel students on the basis of their free speech , even racist hate speech . some lament that what he should have branded as disgraceful was the students ' actions , not the students themselves . legitimate concerns , perhaps . the first amendment question , certainly , is being debated by legal scholars . but these concerns are eclipsed by the bigger picture . boren was n't just condemning wrongdoers ; he was shifting social norms for all . a cynic might consider laughable a refrain from boren 's statement about `` real sooners . '' boren said that real sooners are not racists or bigots ; they believe in equal opportunity , treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family . a cynic might say oklahoma is a state both very white and very red , not known for flying the banner of anti-racism . indeed , the original sooners were the white settlers who raced in to claim land that had been wrested from native americans . but the point of boren 's `` real sooners '' riff is not to describe or sanitize today 's reality ; it is to issue a challenge . it is to bind people to a creed , a standard of being and belief that is easy to assert but hard to achieve . not unlike being a true patriot . so now begins the longer term . here , another opportunity arises to lead by example . david boren can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen . he can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism . he can now ask his community to face the inequities of history and race . we can all do that . howard schultz , ceo of starbucks , is doing this at his company . he was moved after the incidents of ferguson and staten island to hold truly open forums with employees about the pain and anguish of racial division . but you do n't have to be a college president or a ceo . you do n't have to be a white man in charge to start a tough reckoning with racism -lrb- though it 'd help if more did -rrb- . whoever you are , you can start a new kind of conversation in your neighborhood . on your campus . at your house of worship . ask what the history is . ask why there are such imbalances of power and voice . ask what it would take to be truly inclusive . then , in word and deed , start answering your own questions . we can all do that . the sooner , the better .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a federal judge has ordered the defense department to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in iraq and afghanistan during the bush administration . the photos wo n't be made public right away . in an order issued friday , u.s. district judge alvin k. hellerstein of the southern district of new york granted the government 60 days to appeal . the aclu sued the defense department in 2003 to have the photos made public . it 's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken , but in an august opinion hellerstein said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in afghanistan and iraq and may have hundreds or thousands more . some of the photos may have come from the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq . in 2004 , photos became public that showed american soldiers abusing abu ghraib detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions . people in the mideast and americans were outraged and shocked by the photos , which added to the national debate on the use of torture in the war on terror . hellerstein said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger american soldiers or civilians overseas . in july 2011 , the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because u.s. troops were still fighting in iraq . by december 2011 , most u.s. ground troops had withdrawn from iraq , the judge wrote , and he did n't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations . `` three years is a long time in war , the news cycle and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism , '' he wrote . the judge also said the government failed to convince him a collective review of the photos met the requirements of the protected national security documents act . the aclu argued the defense department must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put americans in danger . jameel jaffer , aclu deputy legal director , said in a statement that the photos are `` the best evidence of what took place in the military 's detention centers , and their disclosure would help the public better understand the implications of some of the bush administration 's policies . '' a response by the pentagon to the judge 's decision was not immediately available . the pentagon has refused to release the photos requested by the aclu , saying publication could endanger american soldiers and civilians overseas . several u.s. military leaders who saw some of the pictures made that argument in a december 19 filing in the lawsuit . they pointed to public demonstrations in mideast countries that followed reports of quran burnings , the release of the video `` innocence of the muslims '' and the 2012 release of a video that showed americans soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants . navy rear adm. sinclair harris of the joint chiefs of staff said islamist extremist groups like isis use `` imagery associated with united states detention practices '' as part of their recruiting efforts . the aclu responded by saying the military leaders did n't see all the photos , just a sampling selected by an army lawyer . the aclu also said the leaders did n't explain how the photos were `` similarly inflammatory . '' their prediction of anti-american violence was only speculation , the aclu said . `` to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , '' jaffer of the aclu said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- everyone 's favorite male models made a surprise appearance at tuesday 's valentino show at paris fashion week . and , no surprise , they were really , really ridiculously good-looking . ben stiller and owen wilson reprised their roles as the vacuous models from the popular 2001 film `` zoolander '' at tuesday 's women 's couture show . there was no mistaking stiller for anyone other than the fierce zoolander as he sashayed down the runway in a valentino trench , casting blue steel in every direction . he was followed by nemesis hansel mcdonald , played by wilson , showing off another valentino coat over a pair of `` lovely '' pajamas , wall street journalist fashion columnist christina binkley said . the duo is gearing up for `` zoolander 2 , '' which is slated for release in february 2016 . `` apparently derek and hansel have come to terms on #zoolander2 , '' ben stiller joked in a selfie posted on his instagram account . publicity stunt , perhaps , but we 're not complaining about an opportunity to bring back the phrase , `` he 's so hot right now .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a well-heeled employer goes back to his hotel after a hard -lrb- ish -rrb- day 's work and finds no hot dinner on the table . he snaps , lashing out -lrb- allegedly -rrb- at the nearest underling who could be held responsible . within days , almost 1 million people sign a petition for him not to lose his job , while the suspension of the tv program he presents loses the bbc 4 million viewers . why is this man so popular that he can be accused of abusing his staff -lrb- not to mention members of other ethnic groups and nationalities -rrb- and seemingly get away with it ? a serial offender , jeremy clarkson seems to enjoy a charmed life . but , with the bbc now deliberating over his future , has his luck finally run out ? not a chance . clarkson , like so many celebrities , sees his stock grow with every controversy . every indiscretion seems calculated to raise his profile and boost his esteem among his fervent followers that little bit further . the `` eeny , meeny , miny , moe '' incident , which saw the n-word slip out -- whoops , did i really hear what i think i heard ? -- was designed to achieve just the right effect : offensive enough to generate howls of protest , but trivial enough for his fans to spring to his defense , crying `` over-reaction '' and `` storm in a teacup . '' the presenter later apologized , saying his efforts to obscure the offending word `` were n't quite good enough . '' on this latest occasion , was it the beleaguered producer lodging a complaint , or , like any normal person who 's been punched in the face by a thug , pressing charges with the local constabulary ? no , it was none other than clarkson who willingly gave himself up to the corporation . go on , sack me , he seemed to be saying , when he told a reporter that his dismissal `` is coming , is n't it ? '' see how my adoring public likes that . former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and chelsea manager jose mourinho are , like clarkson , seasoned experts in rebranding themselves -lrb- or their team -rrb- as the victims , even when they seem to have everything going for them bar the position of the stars . they have all perfected the glum , hangdog expression that invites sympathy , begging forgiveness for each misdemeanour . it makes their success all the sweeter if they can convince us that they achieved it in the face of hostility . while waiting for the bbc to deliver its verdict , clarkson penned an article for the sun in which he likened himself to a `` dinosaur '' whose time is about to run out , knowing full well that his followers will protest : no , of course you 're not washed up and irrelevant , jeremy . britain needs you to stand up to johnny foreigner ! it is almost tempting to wonder whether there might be a political role ahead of him should the beeb decide to give him the push for once and for all -lrb- i use the word `` political '' advisedly here -rrb- . the romans had a goddess , fama , who fanfared both good and bad deeds for all eternity . badly behaved celebrities have their trumpets blown by the massed forces of the media , which are of course only too pleased to have such good copy . clarkson is already assured of immortality , if only through youtube or its futuristic equivalent , but while waiting to shuffle off this mortal coil he -- like all celebrities -- acts as a conduit of divinity . he is the chain that binds the earthly audience to the goddess fama , and this is why we allow him to act in such a beastly way , without complaining -lrb- too much -rrb- . in the east of india , holy intermediaries called kalasis beat devotees with canes . the devotees flinch with the mortal pain , but they receive it as a blessing . contestants on the x factor queue all night for the opportunity to be verbally abused by simon cowell . bruises , actual and emotional , are worn with pride , whether delivered by the kalasis cane , cowell 's tongue , or clarkson 's fist -lrb- allegedly -rrb- . they are blessed that are touched by celebrity . so how about oisin tymon , clarkson 's hapless producer , who , according to the daily telegraph , had to seek hospital treatment for a cut lip following the `` fracas ? '' had he presented poor , weary jeremy with a nice succulent steak on his arrival that evening , he would still be languishing in the realms of the unknown . and do n't feel sorry for the hotel owner either : just watch bookings at simonstone hall , the yorkshire hotel where the alleged incident took place , go through the roof . they may as well start engraving that blue plaque now .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- last november , the american people placed a great amount of trust in republicans when they gave them complete control of congress . voters bought the illusion that a republican congress would govern effectively , help the middle class and focus on important issues like jobs and the economy . now , after two months , that illusion has been shattered . over the last two weeks , we have seen the republican congress manufacture , then escalate , a political crisis by threatening to shut down the department of homeland security . there is no government task more basic than keeping citizens safe . and yet republicans are recklessly putting our national security at risk to protect their own political security . by failing to do a full extension of dhs funding -- holding it hostage with demands that the legislation roll back the president 's immigration actions -- republicans are leaving uncertain the livelihoods of more than 240,000 men and women who proudly serve as employees of the border patrol , transportation security administration and other dhs agencies . local law enforcement will continue to be denied access to the grants that help them keep our streets safe . the federal emergency management agency and other agencies that respond to natural disasters , like major winter storms , would have their operations disrupted . all so republicans can try to score a few cheap political points with their base . but while this shutdown crisis is scary , what is even scarier is that this dysfunctional governing style is becoming a pattern with the republican party . the republican congress seems more intent on bickering with itself , pushing an agenda to help special interests and catering to the most extreme wing of the party , than working for the middle class . these last two months have been a disgrace , a disservice to our country , and the american people wo n't soon forget what a reckless disaster republicans in congress have turned out to be .

'' robb said it has not yet been determined if any crime occurred . in a statement , college administrators said the fraternity 's local chapter had been suspended for one year by the penn state interfraternity council and that police and university officials were investigating . the statement said the fraternity used the private facebook page to post `` highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at penn state . '' the images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose , others appeared incapacitated . `` the evidence offered by the facebook postings is appalling , offensive and inconsistent with the university community 's values and expectations , '' the statement said . penn state university president eric barron said in a separate statement wednesday that the university will work with kappa delta rho 's national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated . the university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at penn state , barron said . `` it ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a re-evaluation of the fraternity system is required , '' he said . `` some members of the university senior leadership believe it is , and we are considering our options . '' david clohessy , director of the st. louis-based survivors network of those abused by priests , or snap , said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university 's handling of sex crime reports . `` for years now , penn state enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who 'd listen that the university 's problematic culture about sex crimes had been ` reformed , '' clohessy said . `` the latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on facebook , some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims . '' in 2012 , former penn state assistant football coach jerry sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a 30 - to 60-year prison term . sandusky , who has maintained his innocence , is appealing . `` the kappa delta rho is a wake-up call , '' clohessy said . `` but the sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too . '' a former member of kappa delta rho alerted police to the page , telling them in january that it had been used by members to share photos of `` unsuspecting victims , drug sales and hazing , '' according to a copy of a police affidavit . the drugs allegedly included `` marijuana and edibles , concentrates , add medication , and some cocaine , '' the affidavit said . the former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second facebook page called `` 2.0 '' allegedly had been created around april 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it , the affidavit said . the earlier version of the page was titled `` covert business transactions . '' rape , nude photos , racist behavior : do fraternities make men behave badly ? the ex-frat member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his facebook page logged in , the affidavit said . the affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges , including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used . in the sandusky case , the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by sandusky -- either groped in a car , soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed . the scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and penn state 's vaunted football program , including the dismissal of the late legendary coach joe paterno and one of america 's highest-paid university presidents , graham spanier . it also tarnished penn state 's celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics . `` we hope that penn state officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students , '' said clohessy , whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations . attempts to reach the university and interfraternity council were unsuccessful . cnn 's laura ly and sara ganim contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- chinese relic experts claim that a 1,000-year-old mummified monk encased in a buddha statue was stolen from a village temple in eastern china in 1995 , state media reported . the mummy made international headlines last year when it first showcased at drents museum in the netherlands . the cultural relic bureau in fujian province launched an investigation and found photos and historical records suggesting the statue belonged to a village temple where it was worshiped as an ancestor . the bureau will continue the investigation and report to national cultural authorities to seek repatriation in compliance with normal procedures , a spokesperson told the state-run xinhua news agency on sunday . the statue , currently in possession of a dutch private collector , was being housed at the hungarian natural history museum as a part of a european tour . the museum announced on their website that the mummy , originally scheduled to be on display until may , has been pulled from the exhibition at `` the request of the loaning partner '' -- the drents museum . it 's unclear exactly when or how the statue made its way to a market in the netherlands where a private buyer bought it in 1996 . drents museum said the owner , who prefers to remain anonymous , had bought it legally . the mummy was discovered when the owner brought it to an expert for restoration . but it was n't until a team of researchers and scientists did a ct scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year , did they discover the mummy 's organs were missing . `` we thought it would be lung tissue , but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with chinese characters , '' said vincent van vilsteren , an archaeology curator from drents museum . the mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in chinese inscriptions , revealing its identity as a buddhist monk called liuquan who may have practiced `` self-mummification '' to prepare for life after death . the process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like japan , china and thailand , and was practiced more than a thousand years ago . the elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots . the few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered . `` we suspect that for the first 200 years , the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a buddhist temple in china ... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue , '' said van vilsteren . researchers are still waiting on dna analysis results to help trace the mummy back to its exact location in china .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- the discovery of the remains of richard iii beneath a car parking lot in the english city of leicester in 2012 sparked excitement around the world . now those bones are to be reburied following a series of commemorations full of the pomp and circumstance befitting of a royal farewell . in the years since it was exhumed , the king 's skeleton has given up plenty of secrets -- and research continues to find out more . say the name richard iii to most people , and the image that will spring to mind is of shakespeare 's villain , a cruel , conniving figure whose nasty character is reflected in his physical abnormalities , a `` poisonous bunch-backed toad . '' history , they say , is written by the victors , and according to the tudors and their most famous playwright , richard was hunchbacked , with a withered hand and limping gait , `` deformed , unfinished ... and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them . '' for the archaeologists searching for richard 's remains , the sight of the freshly-uncovered skeleton 's twisted spine was the moment the hairs began to stand up on the back of their necks ; tests later revealed the king suffered from idiopathic adolescent-onset scoliosis . but while the skeleton 's curved vertebrae are striking , experts say the resulting disability would not have been obvious in richard iii when he was alive . it would have meant his right shoulder was slightly higher than the other , but this was likely disguised by clothing , and so only apparent to the king 's closest family and confidantes . read more : richard iii 's spine twisted , not hunched . the most famous portraits of richard iii depict him as dark-haired and steely eyed , but they were painted some 25 to 30 years after his death , and dna tests on the remains suggest they are far from accurate . genetic specialist turi king , from the university of leicester , said analysis of various genetic markers offered clues to the king 's appearance , suggesting he was actually fair haired and had blue eyes . '' -lsb- there are -rsb- genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color , '' she told cnn in december 2014 . `` the genetic evidence shows he had a 96 % probability of having blue eyes , and a 77 % probability of having blond hair , though this can darken with age . '' this would mean that the painting of richard iii held by the society of antiquaries of london is the closest approximation we have to his real appearance : it shows him with grey-blue eyes and lighter brown hair than other portraits . read more : dna clue to richard iii 's appearanceread more : is this the face of richard iii ? it is perhaps not surprising that a monarch would have a taste for the finer things in life , but heron -- really ? well yes -- in the medieval period wildfowl such as heron , egret and even swan would have featured heavily on the high-protein menus of the aristocracy . scientists at the british geological survey measured the levels of isotopes including oxygen , strontium , nitrogen and carbon in richard iii 's remains , revealing clues to what he ate and drank . they spotted a dramatic change in the last few years of his life -- suggesting his dietary habits became markedly richer once he became king . `` obviously , richard was a nobleman beforehand , and so his diet would be reasonably rich already , '' explained isotope geochemist angela lamb , who led the study . `` but once he became king we would expect him to be wining and dining more , banqueting more . `` we have the menu from his coronation banquet and it was very elaborate -- lots of wildfowl , including real ` delicacies ' such as peacock and swan , and fish -- carp , pike and so on . '' read more : king 's bones reveal luxury lifestyle . something in that rich diet made richard iii sick : scientists from the university of cambridge and the university of leicester found evidence the king was suffering from a roundworm infection when he died . researchers examining soil samples from the pelvis and skull of the skeleton spotted roundworm eggs in the area where the dead monarch 's intestines would have been . roundworm eggs -- in this case ascaris lumbricoides -- are ingested via contaminated food , water or soil ; once hatched and matured , the worms can grow up to a foot long . `` despite richard 's noble background , it appears that his lifestyle did not completely protect him from intestinal parasite infection , which would have been very common at the time , '' said dr jo appleby , from the university of leicester , who exhumed the king 's remains . `` we would expect nobles of this period to have eaten meats such as beef , pork and fish regularly , but there was no evidence for the eggs of the beef , pork or fish tapeworm , '' said dr piers mitchell of the university of cambridge , adding that the lack of tapeworms suggested the food richard iii ate was thoroughly cooked . read more : richard iii had roundworm infection . richard iii was the last english king to die in battle , at bosworth on august 22 , 1485 . in his `` anglica historia , '' the italian polydore vergil , recorded that : `` king richard alone was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies . '' when archaeologists studied the remains unearthed in leicester , they found evidence of 11 of wounds inflicted at or around the time of his death : nine to his skull and two to other parts of his body . the position of the injuries suggest that richard had lost both his horse and his helmet when he was set upon by opposition troops . `` the most likely injuries to have caused the king 's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon , such as a halberd or bill , and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon , '' said professor guy rutty , who said the wounds were consistent with accounts of what happened to him at bosworth . tests also found an injury to the inside of richard iii 's pelvis which supports contemporary reports that his body was subjected to acts of ritual humiliation after his death . read more : richard iii 's fatal wounds revealed .

'' cybercrime has come a long way in the past decade -- from the cliched nigerian prince scam to credit card theft , and suspected government surveillance over emails . tabriz 's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in google 's software , and sell the information to governments or criminals . to combat this , the company has set up a vulnerability rewards program , paying anywhere from $ 100 to $ 20,000 for reported glitches . `` what we 've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications , '' said tabriz . `` in one case , there were iranian-region gmail users whose connection was being intercepted .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama shared jokes about pot and hillary clinton 's email controversy at the annual gridiron club dinner in washington on saturday . the club 's dinner brings together washington 's media elite , with noteworthy politicians typically attending , as well . despite being held by a media organization that raises scholarship funds for journalism students , the dinners are generally closed to cameras . organizers only allowed a select few pool reporters to enter while the president spoke . the lack of media glare allows guests to let some of their guard down , perhaps unleashing a few more jokes than they might if the cameras were rolling . at one point obama , clad in a white tie , predicted he would get more laughs this year than in the past . `` i 'm not saying i 'm any funnier . i 'm saying weed is now legal in d.c. , '' he said . voters in the district of columbia legalized small amounts of marijuana last year , much to the chagrin of some in congress . the president also touched on the controversy over the archiving of clinton 's emails while she was secretary of state . obama lamented that while he was once a tech-savvy candidate , clinton now seemed more up to speed . `` now i 'm yesterday 's news , and hillary has got a server in her house . i did n't even know you could have one of those in your house . i am so far behind . did you know that ? i would have gotten one , '' he joked . the domain name for clinton 's private email address was @clintonemail . com . obama was n't the only politician attending this year 's dinner . wisconsin gov. scott walker also dropped in . he 's of course rumored to be in contention to run for president in 2016 . walker , a republican , acknowledged some headlines of his own , like when rudy giuliani said at a walker event last month that he does n't think obama loves america . to date , walker had n't said whether he agreed with giuliani or not . `` i want to get this out of the way once and for all . i believe president obama loves america and every single american in it . except for rudy giuliani , '' walker said , according to a transcript provided by his staff . `` if i did not love america , i would n't have moved here from kenya , '' obama later countered in a joking reference to unsubstantiated theories that he was n't born in the united states . every president since 1885 except for grover cleveland has attended the 130-year-old organization 's dinner . obama has attended three times as president and last attended back in 2013 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a quick descent . no distress call . the pilot 's actions . it will be months , or longer , before the causes behind tuesday 's crash of germanwings flight 4u 9525 are known , but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators . speculation comes in the wake of any tragedy such as this , but experts say certain facts can be significant for those who want to know what happened . the most useful clues so far : . one of the plane 's `` black boxes '' has been recovered , the french interior minister said . the data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash . its contents are still unknown , but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash . france 's aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately , the interior minister said . real-time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story . according to online flight trackers , the germanwings plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when , about 30 minutes into the trip , it started descending . six minutes later , it was recorded at 24,000 feet -- a drop of 14,000 feet . it continued to descend after that -- it 's last recorded altitude was 11,400 feet . the rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said . if the engines had stalled , the plane would have crashed in less time , she said . departure : barcelona , spain , at 10:01 a.m. -lrb- 26 minutes late -rrb- . destination : scheduled to land in dusseldorf , germany , at 11:39 a.m. passengers : 150 -lrb- 144 passengers , six crew members -rrb- . airplane : airbus a320 -lrb- twin-jet -rrb- . airline : germanwings -lrb- budget airline owned by lufthansa -rrb- . flight distance : 726 miles . last known tracking data : 10:38 a.m. . last known speed : 480 mph . last known altitude : 11,400 feet . last known location : near digne-les-bains , france , in the alps . sources : cnn and flightaware.com . the initial data about the plane 's descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , schiavo said . a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said . another aviation analyst , david soucie , said the quickness of the descent shows something went wrong , but also that the plane was not out of control . the plane was descending `` faster than an elevator at that point . you 're feeling it down . it 's pulling you down , and you can sense that , '' soucie said . a telling piece of data is that the plane maintained speed as it descended , he said . it could show that the pilot was aware that something was wrong and was controlling the speed as the plane went down . `` it was a controlled descent , and there was something that had gone wrong that he had no control over or he would have controlled it , '' soucie said . the data on air traffic accidents are clear : a majority of accidents happen upon takeoff or landing . according to the federal aviation administration , even though 83 % of a plane 's flight time is taken up with the climb , cruise and descent phases , less than 16 % of accidents happen during this period . soucie described the timing of the crash as an `` anomalous thing that happened . '' it is `` incredibly rare to happen in the middle of the flight , '' he said , meaning the pilot would have to act fast . contrary to some early reports , the french civil aviation authority told cnn that the crew of the germanwings plane did not issue a distress call . it was air traffic controllers who sent out a distress call after radio contact with the plane was lost . the lack of an emergency call can raise a red flag to a nonpilot . why would a pilot not alert someone that there is an emergency ? does it hint to an incursion in the cockpit or a pilot 's motives ? it might sound counterintuitive , but calling for help is not the first thing on a pilot 's checklist when things go wrong . soucie said the principle that a pilot follows during an emergency is this : aviate , navigate and communicate . in other words , before turning on a distress call or transponder , the pilot 's first concern is to fly the plane , and secondly , to find the safest option for a crash landing , if it comes to that . the germanwings pilot `` was definitely aviating and navigating from what we can tell , '' soucie said . the pilot was conceivably looking for a place to try to land , he said . a distress call -- had it happened -- could have signaled a different story . schiavo explained that there are codes that pilots have -- certain words that if uttered by the pilot indicate to air traffic controllers that there is a hijacking . the initial reports are that there was no hijack code transmitted from the plane . a big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not . `` i do n't think you 'd rule anything out at this point , '' cnn aviation analyst miles o'brien said . `` it 's not like it appears as if it was an in-flight breakup . so what was going on in the cockpit is what we 're going to be talking about in the coming days . '' o'brien pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent , no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a `` typical emergency scenario . '' there were no reported weather issues during the plane 's flight , but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause , pilot and cnn aviation analyst les abend said . one thing abend was looking at was a cold front progressing in the area where the plane was . it indicated some precipitation at lower altitudes . so there may not have been bad weather at the cruising altitude , but `` at lower altitudes , as they were beginning the descent , their visibility may have been obscured , '' abend said . reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue , but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash , he said .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- two years after she underwent a double mastectomy to cut her cancer risk , actress and u.n. envoy angelina jolie has had surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes for the same reason , she wrote in the new york times on tuesday . jolie , 39 , carries a mutation of the brca1 gene , which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer . her mother was diagnosed with the latter at age 49 and died seven years later . in her new york times op-ed tuesday , jolie said she had been planning the latest preventive surgery for some time . doctors : angelina jolie did the right thing . but a blood test that revealed worrying markers accelerated the process , the hollywood star said . her doctor told her he wanted her to see a surgeon immediately to check her ovaries . `` i went through what i imagine thousands of other women have felt , '' she wrote . `` i told myself to stay calm , to be strong , and that i had no reason to think i would n't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren . '' her husband , oscar-winning actor brad pitt , was on a plane back from france within hours , she wrote . `` the beautiful thing about such moments in life is that there is so much clarity . you know what you live for and what matters . it is polarizing , and it is peaceful , '' she wrote . further tests came back negative for tumors , jolie wrote . `` there was still a chance of early stage cancer , but that was minor compared with a full-blown tumor . to my relief , i still had the option of removing my ovaries and fallopian tubes and i chose to do it . '' jolie stresses that not all women with the same brca1 gene mutation should feel they must automatically leap to surgery , but she urges them to explore their options and take control . her family history -- she lost her grandmother and aunt to cancer , as well as her mother -- combined with the gene mutation meant that in her case , the removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes seemed the best course . while not as complex as the mastectomy surgery , its effects are more severe , jolie said , since it puts a woman into forced menopause . she must now take estrogen and progesterone in order to keep a hormonal balance . she will not be able to have more children and foresees physical changes , she said . but jolie acknowledged she was lucky because she already has a family , unlike some women who face this difficult decision . `` it is not possible to remove all risk , and the fact is i remain prone to cancer , '' she said . `` i will look for natural ways to strengthen my immune system . i feel feminine , and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family . i know my children will never have to say , ` mom died of ovarian cancer . ' '' opinion : i know how jolie feels . the actress has been in a relationship with pitt since the mid-2000s . they have three biological and three adopted children . she wrote two years ago that her preventive double mastectomy had cut her risk of developing breast cancer from 87 % to 5 % . jolie serves as a special envoy for the united nations high commissioner for refugees and has visited refugee camps around the world . she is also a vocal global campaigner on the issue of sexual violence against women .

'' neither serena nor venus has played in the tennis tournament since . that will end friday when serena williams , the world no. 1 , faces monica niculescu , the 68th-ranked player in a second-round match . the end of the boycott took a lot of conversations with a lot of people , williams told reporters thursday . two of the most important were with her parents . `` it was a really emotional time for me , '' she said , saying the prospect of the talks made her a little nervous . she told them she would n't go back if they did n't want her to go . but they both said to play . her dad said it would be a big mistake not to come back , she said . williams said her mother said , `` i will be there for you . '' venus williams , the no. 11 singles player , is n't playing in the tournament , but serena williams said her older sister was 100 % behind her . she is `` very happy that i am here . and even encouraged me to come , '' serena williams said . serena williams announced her return to the event in a time magazine first-person piece in february , writing she would ended her boycott in the spirit of forgiveness . she said thursday that she did n't just have to forgive the fans at indian wells . `` in order to forgive , you have to be able to really let go of everything . i kind of let go a long time ago , and i kind of forgave , but i was n't at point where i was ready to come back , '' she said . the timing seemed right this year , she said . she added that she will be a little nervous in her first match at the bnp paribas open . still she was `` looking forward actually to kind of stepping out on center court and letting the whole world know that it does n't matter what you face -- whether it 's something that was n't right , something that hurt you , hurt your family . you can just come out and be strong .

'' the figures were presented friday in a nearly six-minute video on the creflo dollar ministries website and total more than $ 60 million needed to buy the gulfstream g650 , which goes for a reported $ 65 million . the page featuring the video and information on the fundraiser has been taken down , but those wishing to donate are still able to do so on the church 's gift page . the project is n't limited to member donations , as the site states that `` we are asking members , partners and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a gulfstream g650 . '' the request goes on to detail that the luxury jet will transport pastors creflo and taffi dollar and member of the dollars ' church around the globe to help them spread the gospel . prosperity gospel is a theology that promises wealth and health to those who tithe 10 % of their income to the church . the video includes parishioners , a pilot , a project manager and even the president of liberia , ellen johnson sirleaf , advocating on behalf of the pastor . on the video , the pastor chronicles incidents involving his current jet , which has been in service for more than three decades : the right engine went out en route to australia , but the plane was able to safely land at its destination thanks to the experience of the pilot and crew . during another trip , mechanical failure caused the jet to skid off a runway in london while taffi dollar and their three daughters were aboard . dollar attributed his family 's safe arrival to `` a grace working on that airplane , that brought my girls back home to me , you understand what i am saying ? '' he said from the pulpit to thunderous applause . dollar said that after those incidents , he `` knew that it was time to begin to believe god for a new airplane . '' the gulfstream g650 would comfortably allow the ministry make its way around the world . it seats up to 14 passengers with berthing for six , according to gulfstream.com . the jet comes with two rolls-royce engines , high-speed internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four-and-a-half-hour commute from new york to los angeles . `` the g650 is the biggest , fastest , most luxurious , longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far , '' according to the site . in soliciting the donations , dollar 's site states , `` we need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord jesus christ . your love gift of any amount will be greatly appreciated .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- last summer , amid startling news reports of manipulation , mismanagement and possibly death caused by failures at the department of veterans affairs , congress came together and passed legislation to overhaul veterans ' access to health care . i was proud to sponsor the veterans access , choice and accountability act of 2014 -lrb- the choice act -rrb- , and deliver good news to veterans : they would have a choice when it comes to accessing health care they deserve , and many would have the option of seeing their local physician . now , the va is trying to take the choice away . a mere six months after the choice act was signed into law , and only three months after veterans began to receive their choice cards , the president 's budget attempts to reallocate the law 's emergency funds that are solely meant to pay for veterans ' health care in their communities . the va says these funds are n't being used quickly enough because veterans are n't interested in getting care from their local physicians . that could not be further from the truth . thousands of veterans are struggling to access the care they were promised through the choice act because of the va 's flawed implementation of the law and foolish interpretation of the 40-mile rule in the distance criteria . when congress passed the choice act , the intent was that veterans be allowed to access local health care if they can not receive the va care they need within 40 miles of their home , or their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days . unfortunately , the va decided to narrow the interpretation of the 40-mile rule , choosing to take into account only the distance of a va medical facility from a veteran 's home and not whether the va facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs . veterans are being told they can not use their choice cards because they live within 40 miles of a va facility , even though that facility does not offer the care they require . the va is denying the access the law was intended to provide and forcing veterans to choose between traveling hours to a va medical facility , paying out of pocket or going without care altogether . veterans simply want what they were promised in the choice act : the choice to access the care they deserve in their community . in my hometown of hays , kansas , a veteran is forced to drive 200 miles several times a month for routine cortisone shots because the va outpatient clinic just 25 miles from his home does not offer the shots he needs . one would think this veteran could use his choice card to visit a local physician or local hospital to get the shots he needs -- but the va is denying access to this care . thousands of veterans across the country are facing this same frustration . why is common sense not prevailing at the va ? why is the va not bending over backward to take care of veterans ? as a member of the senate veterans ' affairs committee , i have questioned va secretary bob mcdonald and other va officials for months in hearings , personal meetings , phone calls and correspondence about the va 's flawed interpretation of the 40-mile rule and what can be done to fix the problem . congress specifically included language in the choice act that gives the va the authority and flexibility it needs to provide veterans with access to care outside the va when the care needed by a veteran is `` either unavailable or not cost-effective to provide at a va facility . '' but for some reason , the va refuses to use the authority congress gave it and put the best interest of veterans first . enough is enough . in the absence of va action , i authored legislation that would make certain veterans are not dismissed or forgotten just because of where they live . the veterans access to community care act of 2015 -lrb- s. 207 -rrb- would require the va to utilize its authorities , including the choice act , to offer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the health care services they need from a va medical facility within 40 miles of where they live . this legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in congress and has been endorsed by numerous veterans ' organizations , including the american legion , veterans of foreign wars , amvets , vietnam veterans of america and the national guard association of the united states . when congress passed the choice act , we called on the va to live up to its commitment to care for those who have sacrificed for our country -- and we will not back down . we ought to always err on the side of what is best for the veteran , not what is best for the department of veterans affairs .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it turns out that jupiter may be more than just an enormous ball of gas spinning a few hundred million miles farther out in the solar system . we earthlings might have the giant planet to thank for our very existence . two scientists are suggesting that the inner solar system once played host to a bunch of `` super-earths '' -- planets that were larger than our own but smaller than neptune . jupiter , however , put an end to those early occupiers of the inner orbits , bulldozing in and sweeping them into the sun , according to a paper published this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . jupiter 's epic , planet-shattering journey toward the sun and back out again laid the foundations for the creation of earth and the other smaller planets nearby -- mercury , venus and mars . `` our work suggests that jupiter 's inward-outward migration could have destroyed a first generation of planets and set the stage for the formation of the mass-depleted terrestrial planets that our solar system has today , '' said konstantin batygin of caltech , one of the authors of the paper . the theory attempts to explain why our solar system is a bit of an oddball in our galactic neighborhood . most other systems that have planets orbiting around a star similar to our sun look very different . they generally have at least one planet significantly larger than earth that 's in a closer orbit than mercury 's . but they do n't have many objects farther out . maybe that 's because of jupiter 's destructive romp in the early history of the solar system . `` there is no reason to think that the dominant mode of planet formation throughout the galaxy should not have occurred here , '' batygin said . `` it is more likely that subsequent changes have altered its original makeup . '' he and his co-author -- gregory laughlin of university of california , santa cruz -- are building on a scenario of jupiter 's migration that was previously put forward by other scientists . known as the grand tack scenario , it describes jupiter getting drawn toward the sun in the early era of the solar system thanks to its huge mass . what stops it from being sucked right into the sun is saturn . the two gas giants start to exert gravitational influence on one another , entering a planetary dance that eventually sends them back farther out into the solar system . batygin and laughlin suggest that during its inward journey , jupiter dragged a load of planetary building blocks , known as planetesimals , along with it . that sent the planetesimals smashing into debris in the inner solar system , causing them to break apart and fall into the sun at a faster rate . the scientists say they ran a simulation of what would happen if there were also a number of super-earths in the vicinity as well . they found that a wave of decaying planetesimals would steer the super-earths into the sun over the course of 20,000 years . `` it 's a very effective physical process , '' batygin said . `` you only need a few earth masses worth of material to drive tens of earth masses worth of planets into the sun . '' on its way back out , jupiter left some remaining planetesimals in its wake -- the building blocks that over millions of years would come to form earth , mercury , venus and mars .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , which is the largest sponsor of boy scout troops in the united states , says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts , as claims have been made it has n't done enough . in the first interview about allegations of abuse in mormon church-sponsored scouting troops , church elder l. whitney clayton told cnn that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse . `` we feel like there is really no other organization that we know of -- a church or something like a church -- that does as much as we do , '' clayton said . `` we have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse , and we train our people , we teach our people , we work with leaders , we provide materials online and in hard copy . '' over several months , cnn examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts . but clayton said the church today is proactive , even constructing its buildings `` in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur . '' `` for instance , if you walk down the hallway in an lds chapel , a mormon church , and look at the sunday school classes , you 're going to see windows in the doorways into those sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by , '' he said . the interview with clayton followed a cnn investigation into the case of melvin novak , who was sexually abused by his scoutmaster , a member of the mormon church , beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998 , according to the lawsuit novak filed against the church and the boy scouts of america . the scoutmaster , vance hein , had been forced in resign from scouting in the early 1990s after reports surfaced that he failed to report a fellow scoutmaster who was engaged in homosexual activities . that scoutmaster ended up going to prison for sexual assaults on minors . hein 's name was added to the boy scouts of america 's ineligible volunteer files , which are widely known as the `` perversion files . '' the documents , which were made public in 2012 , are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity . however , three years after being kicked out of scouting , hein was allowed to rejoin the scouts after getting letters of recommendation attesting to his character . one of those letters was from hein 's influential mormon bishop jack moyer , who wrote that hein was `` highly respected and liked . '' moyer , who is now retired , declined to speak to cnn . but in a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit last year , he acknowledged that he would not have written the letter knowing what he later found out about hein . the lawsuit charged that hein `` actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation . '' hein eventually was convicted of molesting novak . he is now in prison for violating probation in the novak case . ken rothweiler , who is novak 's lawyer , said what happened in the case is outrageous . `` this case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the lds church , and the reason i say that is because the lds church knew that vance hein , this pedophile , was already kicked out of scouting by the boy scouts of america , '' rothweiler said . however , church attorney david pittinsky said it was the boy scouts organization that should have done something . `` if the boy scouts had disclosed to bishop moyer the information they had in their files , there is no way that vance hein would have ever become a scoutmaster , and he would have been subject to excommunication by the church , '' pittinsky said . in a statement to cnn , the boy scouts of america said hein was removed from scouting `` for reasons unrelated to child abuse . '' the group added , `` our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient , inappropriate or wrong . we extend our deepest apologies to victims and their families . '' read the full response from the boy scouts . the case ended last year with a confidential settlement paid to novak , who is now 31 . all but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and boy scouts of america have been settled . hein was sentenced to probation in 2000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting novak . while on probation , he was arrested for possession of child pornography and was sentenced in 2012 to 15 to 30 years in prison . `` any case is alarming to me . it 's a tragedy , '' clayton said . `` i 'm a father . i have seven children , four boys and three girls . i have 19 grandchildren . the thought of one of them as a child or youth being abused is absolutely horrific to me . '' asked what he would say to novak , clayton said , `` i say to him and anyone else who has been abused in the church or other churches -- i 'm sorry that you 've gone through what you 've gone through . it 's a horrible thing for anyone to be abused . no child , no youth should ever have to go through that .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- one is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball . the other is a football fan who also played competitive golf . the two university of oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common . they 're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks . in it , students at the now-disbanded sigma alpha epsilon fraternity clap , pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching . school officials have expelled parker rice and levi pettit because of their alleged `` leadership role '' in the racist chant . here 's what we know about the two students : . rice , 19 , was raised in dallas , where he recently graduated from jesuit college preparatory school . in high school , he was an avid sportsman , and he played cornerback on the football team , in addition to baseball , the dallas morning news reported . his father , bob rice , is a real estate agent in dallas , where he volunteers for various organizations , including a baseball league and the local ymca , according to the newspaper . earlier this year , a sibling of the younger rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper . in the article , the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together . rice has apologized for the video , calling his actions wrong and reckless . `` i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same , '' he said in a statement tuesday . his family has fled their home , where protesters gathered wednesday . they 've also wiped out their social media accounts . as the university tries to heal after days of controversy , some are rallying to rice 's defense . matthew lopez , a friend and fellow student at the university , said the video is not a reflection of who he is . `` that video does not represent his core personality , '' lopez said . `` unfortunately though , as things are , that might define him for a while . but it does not define him personally , i feel . '' lopez described him as a `` charismatic , good person , with a good soul and a good spirit '' who experienced a lapse in judgment . `` his behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times , when the fraternity was made , which obviously were n't the most tolerant times , '' lopez said . the second student expelled , pettit does not have much of a digital footprint . what appears to be his now deleted twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football . pettit played golf at his alma mater , highland park high school , the dallas morning news reported . in a statement , his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to african-americans , students and university faculty . `` he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting , '' brody and susan pettit said . `` while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist . '' cnn has reached out to both students but has not heard back from rice . a spokesman for the pettit family declined cnn 's request for an interview .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the bbc has suspended jeremy clarkson , the host of car show `` top gear , '' following `` a fracas with a bbc producer , '' the broadcaster said in a statement . `` jeremy clarkson has been suspended pending an investigation , '' they said . `` no one else has been suspended . top gear will not be broadcast this sunday . '' fans of the presenter expressed dismay at the decision . at the time of writing , more than 147,000 people had signed a petition seeking his reinstatement . using the hashtag #bringbackclarkson , some twitter users lamented that the show would not be the same without him . clarkson himself also took to twitter , posting an apology -lrb- of sorts -rrb- to labour leader ed miliband -- for knocking him down the news agenda . `` save clarkson ? '' his co-host james may tweeted . `` save empty cardboard boxes and off-cuts of string . they 're far more useful . '' this is not the first time that clarkson has been at the center of controversy . in may this year , the television presenter asked forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show . clarkson had mumbled the n-word while reciting a children 's nursery rhyme , but that version of the take was never aired . last year , the bbc show hit the headlines when argentina complained about a `` top gear '' special filmed in the country in which the number plate h982 fkl was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 falklands war . forced to stop filming and leave the country , clarkson said on the bbc newsbeat website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental . in a previous article on their website , the bbc said `` jeremy clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion . '' in their statement , the corporation declined to comment any further . jeremy clarkson : hated by liberals , loved by the elite .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- at the time it probably seemed like fun : jeremy clarkson and a crew from the top-rated bbc tv show top gear driving a porsche in argentina . the only problem was that the car 's registration plate , h982 flk , appeared to refer to the 1982 falklands war between the uk and argentina , fought over a remote british colony off the coast of patagonia , which both countries claim . the conflict , which claimed the lives of 655 argentinian servicemen and 255 britons , ended with a british victory . clarkson and the rest of the production team were in the country filming a tv special on a remote highway that passes through chile and argentina , and the number plate sparked anger among locals over the perennially touchy subject of the war . as the crew attempted to flee by road to chile , they were attacked by an angry crowd who hurled rocks and bricks at the porsche and other cars in the convoy . clarkson , who fronts top gear , later said an angry mob tried to attack them with pickax handles and shouted `` burn their cars . '' `` this was not some jolly jape that went awry . for once , we did nothing wrong , '' he told the sun . top gear producers said the numbers and letters on the registration plates had not been chosen deliberately . the motoring show , fronted by clarkson , james may and richard hammond , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often treads the line and regularly steps over it . clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct among the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns . favored topics include environmentalism , traffic laws and liberals . the latest `` fracas '' has seen clarkson suspended by the bbc , which broadcasts top gear , for allegedly hitting a producer . the presenter , who is one of the bbc 's highest earners , has previously caused offense during shoots in foreign countries and regularly court controversy at home . in july 2014 , clarkson came under fire for a racist comment made during a top gear special in myanmar . the slur came during a show segment which showed hosts clarkson , hammond and may looking at a bridge they had built over the river kwai as a local man walked over it . `` that is a proud moment . but there 's a slope on it , '' clarkson said . `` you 're right , '' co-star hammond replied . `` it 's definitely higher on that side . '' following complaints , the uk 's media watchdog , ofcom , said the use of the word `` slope , '' which is a derogatory term , was offensive and that the episode broke broadcasting rules . the show 's executive producer andy wilman said in a statement , that they '' -lsb- regretted -rsb- any offense caused , '' adding , `` when we used the word ` slope ' ... it was a light-hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local asian man who was crossing it . '' over the years , clarkson has been in trouble for an apparent series of racist comments including characterizing mexicans as `` lazy and feckless '' and saying that everyone who traveled to india got `` the trots . '' he was also accused of using the `` n-word '' while filming the motoring show by uk newspaper the mirror . `` eeny , meeny , miny moe ... , '' he sang in video footage published by the mirror , `` catch a nigger by his toe . '' initially , clarkson vehemently denied the accusation on twitter but following public condemnation and calls for the bbc to fire him , he begged viewers for forgiveness in a video statement posted online . `` i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure . i was mortified by this , horrified . it is a word i loathe , '' clarkson said . among the condemnations was a sternly worded statement from 10 downing street , the office uk prime minister david cameron -- a friend of clarkson 's -- saying he would `` certainly not '' use the n-word . according to the bbc , the pm 's spokesperson added that he felt it was `` absolutely right that there has been an apology . '' both clarkson and the uk prime minister have homes in an affluent , rural part of central england known as the cotswolds . they are part of a wealthy group of media , politics and showbiz acquaintances who live in and around cameron 's oxfordshire constituency . they have been dubbed `` the chipping norton set . '' among them is former news international ceo and editor of the sun and the news of the world , rebekah brooks , who came to prominence during the news international phone hacking scandal , for which she was acquitted . they also include former blur musician alex james and elisabeth murdoch , daughter of news corp ceo rupert murdoch . in an article for the daily telegraph , former chief political commentator peter oborne described `` the chipping norton set '' as `` an incestuous collection of louche , affluent , power-hungry and amoral londoners . '' clarkson 's popularity also comes from regular columns in venerated newspaper , the sunday times and tabloid the sun . a recent sunday times column with the headline `` phrasebook , tick . local currency , tick . tracksuit , tick . i 'm off to the north '' attracted the ire of people from the northern english city of liverpool . he wrote : `` people up there -lrb- north -rrb- earn less , die more quickly , have fewer jobs and live in houses that are worth the square root of sod all . '' local newspaper , the liverpool echo , which pointed out that clarkson is a northerner himself , published a series of responses to the piece from local people who described him as `` stuck in the past '' and `` a fake southerner '' whose comments were `` as dated as his double denims .

moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- russian president vladimir putin appeared in public monday for the first time in about 10 days as he met with kyrgyz president almazbek atambayev in the russian city of st. petersburg . putin is n't generally one to shy away from the limelight -- posing with a -lrb- tranquilized -rrb- tiger , riding a horse while shirtless , earning a karate black belt . so his unexplained absence fueled speculation about his health , grip on power and even his love life . although the kremlin and the russian state media released photos and video footage of putin last week , they did not quell the rumors about his whereabouts , because it was unclear when they were taken . so all eyes were turned to st. petersburg on monday for putin 's scheduled meeting with atambayev of kyrgyzstan . his appearance before the press , looking healthy and relaxed , should help put some of the rumors at least to rest . and he made light of his absence , saying : `` it would be boring without gossip . '' in another sign putin has a firm hand on the tiller , defense minister sergey shoigu said the president had ordered russia 's northern fleet to be placed on full combat alert from monday morning for snap checks , russia 's state-run tass news agency reported . the checks are intended to test the fleet 's capacity to ensure russia 's military security in the arctic , tass said . also on alert are russia 's western military district and certain airborne units , with some 38,000 military personnel involved in total . here 's what gave some doubters grist for the rumor mill : on friday -- three days before the scheduled meeting -- a russian state media broadcaster prematurely aired a report that putin had a meeting with atambayev -- although the event had not yet occurred . the station acknowledged the error , but it only heightened the speculation over putin and his whereabouts . social media has been swirling with questions , with hashtags such as #putindead and #putinmissing . was he ill ? was he holed away somewhere with his girlfriend and a new baby , as some in the european media speculated ? there were even dark rumors of a palace coup in which various kremlin factions vying for power might have ousted him . the kremlin vigorously denied that anything was amiss , with putin 's spokesman saying the president was healthy and that his handshake `` can break a hand . '' but his absence came at an uneasy time as the country deals with economic turmoil and strained international relations over the war in ukraine . `` does putin ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the kremlin does n't want to allow putin 's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans , '' cnn analyst frida ghitis wrote . `` putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult . the system requires propaganda and image control . it needs putin to be larger than life . '' last week , presidential spokesman dmitry peskov sought to allay questions , telling russian radio station echo of moscow that people should not worry and that putin was `` absolutely '' healthy . `` no need to worry , everything is all right . he has working meetings all the time , only not all of these meetings are public , '' peskov said thursday . he also dismissed european media reports that putin had a love child . `` i am going to ask people who have money to organize a contest on the best media rumor , '' the kremlin spokesman said . rumblings about putin began last week after a meeting in the kazakh capital , astana , between the russian leader and the presidents of kazakhstan and belarus was postponed at short notice . a kazakh official told reuters that putin had fallen ill . on thursday , he missed his meeting with the federal security service , russia 's counterintelligence agency . putin 's last public appearance was supposedly on march 8 , international women 's day . but some keeping track say he had n't been seen since even earlier -- march 5 . in the course of his many years in power , putin has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader . his exploits , captured on film and released to the media , have been many . and he enjoys a whopping 86 % approval rating , although some critics question the validity of polling they say is carried out in a climate where people are afraid to voice opposition to putin 's government . `` moscow always has been a center for rumors and speculation , '' said jill dougherty , an expert on russia at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars and a former cnn correspondent . `` as soon as the president does not show up , which is really kind of rare for him , people begin to question . `` you have to look at this in terms of , why all of this insanity ? and one of the problems is , people are very nervous , legitimately . where is putin ? is he in charge ? '' cnn 's matthew chance contributed to this report .
port vila , vanuatu -lrb- cnn -rrb- tropical cyclone pam had already been battering vanuatu 's capital for hours when the river prima suddenly flooded its banks . a wall of water and mud surged through sam upan 's house , toppling the walls of the neighboring church where he serves as a deacon . it was midnight on friday , and he had no choice but to wade out into the gale force wind and darkness . `` the water was up to my waist ! '' he says . upan eventually made it to higher ground , taking shelter on a parked van . fortunately , he had sent his family away before the storm to a shelter in the center of the capital , port vila . but on monday , three days after the storm struck , upan and his daughters sit in the debris strewn rubble of their home . on sunday , he built a temporary shack for them to sleep under . a bundle of bananas donated by a friend lies nearby in the mud . it 's the only food the family has to eat . nearby , upan 's daughter elsie slowly scrubs mud out of a shirt . other families all across this tropical town are facing similar difficulties in the aftermath of the storm . to many westerners , vanuatu is a holiday destination boasting crystal blue waters and luxury yachts . but it 's also one of the poorest nations in the pacific , and many of its 260,000 inhabitants live in flimsy houses built of thatch or metal sheets . those vulnerable homes were dealt a fearsome blow over the weekend by cyclone pam , one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall . the aid group oxfam is warning that the cyclone may have caused `` one of the worst disasters ever seen in the pacific .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- when walter isaacson 's biography of steve jobs came out in october 2011 -- less than three weeks after jobs ' death -- it crystallized many popularly held perceptions of the apple co-founder . yes , jobs was brilliant . and yes , jobs also could be a bastard . isaacson 's book contained numerous examples of jobs ' cruel behavior , such as verbally abusing employees whose work did n't meet his exacting standards . now a new book is presenting a kinder , gentler portrait of the mercurial tech exec . `` becoming steve jobs , '' by brent schlender and rick tetzeli , seeks to humanize jobs through interviews with those who knew him in the latter , wildly successful phases of his career , when some of his rough edges had softened . the book , which went on sale tuesday , has created a strange irony . unlike isaacson 's book , it 's an unauthorized bio , one that was not given jobs ' blessing before he died . and yet apple , mindful of jobs ' legacy , has clearly endorsed this new vision of their former ceo over the isaacson version . `` i thought the isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice . it was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written , and focused on small parts of his personality , '' says current apple ceo tim cook in the new book . `` you get the feeling that -lrb- steve 's -rrb- a greedy , selfish egomaniac . it did n't capture the person . the person i read about there is somebody i would never have wanted to work with over all this time . life is too short . '' other apple execs also have heaped praise on `` becoming steve jobs '' while criticizing isaacson 's bestseller . `` best portrayal is about to be released - becoming steve jobs -lrb- book -rrb- . well done and first to get it right , '' tweeted eddy cue , apple 's chief of software , last week . and jony ive , apple 's head of design , said in a new yorker profile last month , `` my regard -lrb- for isaacson 's book -rrb- could n't be any lower . '' isaacson , for his part , told the new york times recently that he tried to present a balanced view of jobs : `` my book is very favorable and honest , with no anonymous slings , '' he said . although jobs ' life and career have been well chronicled , the new book contains some fresh tidbits : . -- in 2009 , when jobs was dying of cancer , cook offered his boss a piece of his liver but jobs refused , saying , `` no , i 'll never let you do that . '' -- what was likely the last movie jobs watched before his death was an odd choice : `` remember the titans , '' the sentimental disney drama about a racially integrated high school football team in 1971 . `` i was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie , '' cook recalled . `` i was like , ` are you sure ? ' steve was not interested in sports at all . '' -- and jobs ' famous commencement speech at stanford university in 2005 almost got derailed before it started . a police officer turned him and his family away from the campus , saying the parking lot was full , and expressed skepticism that the scruffy jobs , wearing his usual jeans and black t-shirt , was really the event 's keynote speaker . raves from apple aside , early reviews of `` becoming steve jobs '' have been mixed . '' ` becoming steve jobs ' offers a more rounded portrait of the man not only because it does n't lean as heavily on its interviews or stretch for historical weight like isaacson 's book , but because it brings in schlender 's personal interactions with the apple co-founder , '' wrote mic wright for the next web . `` but the closeness of schlender 's connection with jobs is also problematic , '' added wright , saying '' ... there 's a sense of seeking to explain away bad behavior . '' `` while the book never attempts to portray jobs as a saint , it provides ample evidence to suggest that the brash , perpetually impatient young millionaire learned how to control his worst tendencies , eventually becoming a loving father and respected mentor , '' wrote jeremy horwitz in 9 to 5 mac . `` like other good books that have been written about jobs , it does n't provide the definitive story of his life , but instead adds some new and interesting details that are worth considering alongside what was previously known . ''
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- a british mother is standing by her decision to let her son , 11 , wear a `` fifty shades of grey '' costume to his school 's world book day celebration . `` fifty shades of grey '' tells the tale of a naive college graduate 's energetic trysts with a billionaire -- christian grey -- who has a penchant for bondage . the manchester evening news reported that liam scholes arrived at sale high school in northwest england dressed as grey , complete with cable ties and an eyemask on thursday . the school contacted liam 's mother and told her the costume was inappropriate . nicola scholes told the newspaper she and her son had thought the idea was funny . `` we were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as christian grey , '' she said . `` at first we laughed it off but then we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea . '' the school called her to say the costume was not appropriate and that liam would not take part in the book day event or appear in any photographs , scholes told the paper . a teacher from the school had dressed as the fictional serial killer dexter , scholes said : `` i do n't see why sex is more offensive than murder . '' scholes told bbc news that her son had not read the book or watched the movie spin-off but had been aware of the media around the tale . `` he understood what the cable ties were supposed to represent , as did other children of his age . '' scholes told the bbc the costume was light-hearted : `` it was a laugh , it was tongue in cheek and there was no offense . '' on friday scholes tweeted an image of liam with the caption : `` liam 's offensive book day costume , it was that inappropriate that they told him to change his character and would n't include him on any photos . it also required a phone call home regarding the matter . `` yet it was appropriate for a teacher to dress up as a serial killer and other students to come in with ` guns . ' i thought christian grey was the most talked about book character for the past few years . #nosenseofhumour . '' sale high school issued a statement saying its actions reflected its `` high standards in terms of student behavior , welfare and safeguarding . '' `` the student was not excluded from taking part in any of the activities as has been wrongly reported , his costume was modified and he was then able to fully participate and enjoy the day with his peers , '' headteacher lynn nicholls said . `` the aim of our world book day events was to celebrate and encourage reading and we are disappointed that what was a fantastic day for our students , has been marred by this issue , '' the statement concluded .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the next time someone accuses you of acting like a neanderthal , do n't be offended . just say `` thank you . '' a new study published this month suggests neanderthals were more `` cognitively advanced than we give them credit , '' kansas university 's david frayer said in a release . frayer , a professor emeritus of anthropology , was a part of the study published in the journal plos one that looks at eagle talons found in present-day croatia . the talons are among the thousands of human remains , animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by croatian scientist dragutin gorjanovic-kramberger . only recently , however , did frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000-year-old bones as ones modified by humans . `` i was stunned , '' frayer said of the discovery . `` it 's so obvious that these are cut . '' the markings , including polishes and areas where the bones were `` rubbed together , '' show that the talons were `` manipulated into a piece of jewelry , '' frayer said . frayer co-wrote `` evidence for neanderthal jewelry : modified white-tailed eagle claws at krapina '' with three other croatian scientists . their research indicates neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in geico commercials , but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an `` advanced level of prowess '' in catching birds , according to frayer . `` we ca n't prove it , but we suspect that they were catching these birds , '' he said . even with modern technology , catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do . frayer believes neanderthals must have had excellent `` planning skills and ritual '' they would 've used in catching the bird . `` neanderthals are often thought of to be simple-minded mumbling , bumbling , stumbling fools , '' frayer said . `` but the more we know about them the more sophisticated they 've become .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- cleanup crews on thursday started assessing the damage caused by storms that slashed across oklahoma on wednesday , killing one person and injuring about two dozen others across the state . a reported tornado ravaged a mobile home park , destroying dozens of trailers just west of tulsa in the suburb of sand springs . authorities said the man who died at the river oaks mobile home park had been trying to help his father , who was injured , according to cnn affiliate kjrh . one woman at the mobile home park told kjrh that she was cooking when the storm hit . `` within 5 minutes it was dark and the sirens were going off and you could n't hear yourself think , '' brandy richards said . `` and you just grab the kids and we ran across the street . my best friend has the only house that 's back there , and we barely got into the house and it took the garage . it was so fast . '' `` it looks like there 's been a little war zone around here , '' tammi hart told cnn affiliate ktul . the storm flattened a sand springs gymnastics studio , where 60 kids and adults were huddled underground . `` we were just in the middle of practice and the sirens started going off and we just had to get all the kids to the basement , '' according instructor kelsey haggard , who said she heard a `` big boom '' when the building was hit . `` just really happy everyone got out safe , '' said haggard . `` it was really scary ... it just seems so surreal . '' in addition to the death at the mobile home park , ktul reported two other people were taken to the hospital in critical condition . the oklahoma state department of health said two dozen people were injured across the state , according to cnn affiliate koki . storm damage was reported across the tulsa metro area . gov. mary fallin toured the damage in sand springs on thursday and declared a state of emergency for 25 counties . `` our hearts and prayers go out to the family that lost a loved one and certainly to those who were injured or lost their home or business , '' she said . severe weather also tore through the oklahoma city area , including moore , which has seen more than its share of devastating storms . a massive tornado hit moore nearly two years ago , killing 24 people and injuring hundreds of others . the moore police department said a 2-mile square area had significant damage , mainly roofs off homes and downed trees . trees had to be cleared so law enforcement and emergency vehicles could get through . `` you know , this is n't the first time we 've done this so ... unfortunately , we 've gotten pretty good at getting people back into their residences as quick as we can , '' said sgt. jeremy lewis with the city 's police . until wednesday , there had n't been a single report of a tornado in the united states during march . cnn meteorologist judson jones said there were preliminary reports of seven tornadoes on wednesday . an average year would produce 80 twisters in march , he said . march is typically a transitional month , where warm moist air from the gulf of mexico collides with cold arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes . this year , however , the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the east had remained stuck in more of a winter mode . but that changed this week as an arctic cold front began crashing to the south , bringing together the stormy mix . cnn 's sean morris , anneclaire stapleton , jeremy grisham and dave alsup contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- with majorities in both chambers of congress , it is time for republicans to begin rolling back six years of failed obama administration policies . our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the obama administration . regrettably , military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military adventurism . a strong , robust defense is seen not to deter aggression , but to provoke it . for years , we have systematically underfunded our military , marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt : our entitlement programs . as expected , almost four years after the passage of the budget control act , virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs , while essential defense programs have been sacrificed . political leaders in washington need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government . instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels , the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us , listing the programs and capabilities we 'll need to protect our people and interests around the world , and then funding those efforts . even though we 've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade , the threats to americans at home and abroad are growing . from the rise of the islamic state and the spread of islamic terrorism , to russia 's aggression in europe , to chinese expansionism in the south china sea , the threats to american security are growing . yet , even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty , the united states has been steadily reducing our spending on defense . even before sequestration , president obama made defense cuts of $ 487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs . this was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration , which , when combined with obama 's prior cuts , will total $ 1 trillion over the coming decade . all of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership . the results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies . the slight increase in president obama 's proposed 2016 budget wo n't significantly change that . at the end of this process , our military will be significantly smaller , dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place . the army is on the path to be reduced to pre-world war ii levels . the navy is at pre-wwi levels . and our air force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history . our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies . they have presented not just a crisis of readiness for america , but also a perilous strategic weakness . our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence . history has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend , it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability , and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize . we think we are saving money , but in the long run , we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty . we can afford the military we need , but we must make it a priority . for this reason , we introduced an amendment to the senate budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces . we believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary robert gates in his fy12 budget , the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats . it is the budget that the bipartisan , congressionally-mandated national defense panel stated was `` the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing . '' now that republicans control both house of congress , it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live , not the world the way we wish it was . until now , our approach as a country and a party since the budget control act has not been one of american strength . continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness . we need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation 's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform . in the end , it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade . as members of congress , we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions . despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military , they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain . it 's time that we hold up ours .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- an army national guard member and his cousin have been arrested in illinois for allegedly conspiring to provide material support to the terrorist organization isis , federal prosecutors said thursday . the alleged plot included a plan to attack a u.s. military installation in illinois . in the past 18 months , the justice department 's national security division has prosecuted or is prosecuting 32 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or providing support to terrorist groups . of those cases , 18 allegedly involve support to isis . spc. hasan edmonds , 22 , was arrested wednesday night at chicago midway international airport while attempting to travel to egypt to eventually join isis , according to assistant attorney general for national security john p. carlin and other federal officials said . his cousin , jonas `` yunus '' edmonds , 29 , was arrested at his home in aurora in connection with an alleged plot to carry out an armed attack on an unspecified u.s. military facility in northern illinois where hasan edmonds had been training . the two u.s. citizens were charged , in criminal complaints filed in u.s. district court of the northern district of illinois , with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization . the cousins made an initial appearance thursday afternoon before u.s. magistrate judge sheila finnegan . why is isis so successful at luring westerners ? after an undercover fbi informant posing as an isis fighter outside the united states sent hasan edmonds a facebook `` friend '' request in late 2014 , he began to receive private messages from him indicating that he and his cousin were willing to travel to overseas and fight for isis , according to the court documents . `` inshallah we will complete our task or be grants -lsb- sic -rsb- shahada -lsb- arabic for martyr -rsb- i look forward to the training , '' hasan edmonds is alleged to have told the informant in january . `` i am already in the american kafir army and now i wish only to serve in the army of allah alongside my true brothers . '' they continued to communicate over the following weeks , with hasan edmonds expressing concerns about jonas edmonds ' criminal record and whether he would be allowed to travel overseas . `` they try hard to keep people like him trapped in america , '' he told the undercover fbi employee . `` i know several muslims have been caught attempting the turkey route so tell me why not many americans take the egypt route . i am open to either way , '' hasan edmonds told the informant , according to court documents . on february 2 , hasan edmonds contacted the undercover informant again and said his cousin was willing to carry out an attack on u.s. soil . `` honestly we would love to do something like the brother in paris did , '' hasan edmonds stated , referring to the french terror attacks in january in which 16 people were killed . prosecutors said jonas edmonds contacted the informant to arrange travel accommodations . `` number one on my list is mosul , '' he stated , referring to iraq 's second-largest city . `` if i find myself stuck here -lsb- in the united states -rsb- , i intend to take advantage of being so close to the kuffar . '' jonas edmonds this week accepted that he would be unable to travel and told the fbi informant of his intention to buy ak-47s and grenades to carry out an attack on the military facility . he would use his cousin 's uniform and `` anticipated a body count of 100 to 150 . '' he was given a list of officer rankings by his cousin and advised to `` kill the head , '' according to court documents . prosecutors said jonas edmonds planned to carry out the attack after hasan edmonds left the country . hasan edmonds ' sister said that the family does not believe the allegations against the cousins . `` it 's all a shock , we do n't suspect any of these accusations , '' manchinique bates told cnn affiliate wls . `` we do not believe that any of these alleged charges are true . i honestly do not feel as if my brother is in the u.s. military , but yet leaving the country to join isis . that 's ludicrous . they are n't terrorists . '' a federal complaint alleges that hasan edmonds came to the attention of the fbi in late 2014 . the complaints uses the acronym isil , or islamic state of iraq and the levant . hasan edmonds planned to use his military training to fight for the terrorist organization , prosecutors said in a statement . hasan edmonds booked airline travel to depart wednesday from chicago and arrive in cairo on thursday . the cousins presented an undercover informant with plans to attacks the military facility , prosecutors said . who has been recruited to isis from the west ? `` disturbingly , one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack , '' carlin said in the statement . conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . the number of foreign fighters traveling to join isis 's ranks is increasing at an alarming rate , a top u.s. counterterrorism official said last month . more than 20,000 fighters , from more than 90 countries , have traveled to the isis battlefield , according to the testimony of nicholas rasmussen , director of the national counterterrorism center , before the house homeland security committee . the rate of foreign fighters traveling to syria `` exceeds the rate of travelers who went to afghanistan and pakistan , iraq , yemen or somalia at any point in the last 20 years , '' rasmussen said . of those fighters , an estimated 3,400 are believed to have come from western countries , including more than 150 from the united states , officials said . a u.s. air force veteran , who allegedly tried to join isis but was turned back by turkish authorities before he could get to syria , pleaded not guilty earlier this month to terror-related charges in a federal court in new york . tairod nathan webster pugh , accused of making the foiled attempt in january , was indicted by a grand jury on charges of trying to give material support to the terror group and obstruction of justice , the u.s. justice department said in a two-count indictment . cnn 's evan perez contributed to this report .

'' relatives of those believed to be on the flight , fearing the worst , gathered at the barcelona airport , where a crisis center was set up . french authorities set up a chapel near the crash site . lufthansa group said the company will look after the relatives of those on board . `` there will be a contact center established in france ; relatives who would like to take advantage of this will be transferred to the contact center at no cost -- and their accommodation paid for -- just as soon as the center has been established , '' lufthansa said . those aboard included a `` high number of spaniards , germans and turks , '' according to spain 's king felipe vi . germanwings ceo thomas winkelmann said it 's believed 67 people , or nearly half those on the plane , are german citizens . germanwings crash : who was on the plane ? sixteen students and two teachers from one german high school , called joseph koenig gymnasium , were among those booked on flight 9525 , according to florian adamik , a municipal official in haltern , the town where the school is located . a crisis center has been established at the city hall in haltern , which is about 77 kilometers -lrb- 48 miles -rrb- north of dusseldorf 's airport . winkelmann confirmed the 16 students and two teachers were on the plane . haltern 's mayor , bodo klimpel , said they had been heading home after taking part in a foreign exchange program . `` the whole city is shocked , and we can feel it everywhere , '' klimpel said . a dutch citizen and a belgian -- the latter a resident of barcelona -- were among those on the flight , according to those countries ' foreign ministries . two australians and two colombians were also believed to be on board . germanwings started in 2002 and was taken over by lufthansa seven years later as its low-cost airline , handling an increasing number of midrange flights around europe . it was forced to cancel some flights tuesday because there were crews that did n't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash . the valley where the plane went down is long and snow-covered , and access is difficult , said the mayor of the nearby town of barcelonnette , pierre martin-charpenel . it was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now , he said . it 's an out-of-the-way place with magnificent scenery , he said . the sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash , said sandrine julien from the town hall of seyne-les-alpes village . seyne-les-alpes is about 10 kilometers from the crash site . mountain guide yvan theaudin told bfmtv the crash was in the area of the massif des trois eveches , where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- . it 's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening , he said , which could complicate search and rescue efforts . responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground , he said . sandrine boisse , president of the tourism office at the pra loup ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened . `` it was about 11 -lrb- a.m. -rrb- here . i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , and at first we thought it was an avalanche , '' she said . `` something was wrong . ... we did n't know what . '' a mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash , michel suhubiette , said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site . according to the u.s. federal aviation administration , just under 16 % of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent . accidents are more common during takeoff and landing . the twin-engine airbus a320s , which entered service in 1988 , is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft , aviation analyst david soucie said . the captain of the crashed plane had flown for germanwings for more than 10 years , and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of airbus . the plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in dusseldorf on monday , according to winkelmann . so what happened ? cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said the plane 's speed is one clue . according to germanwings , the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for eight minutes . the plane lost contact with french radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet . then it crashed . this could indicate that there was not a stall , but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , schiavo said . had there been an engine stall , the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes , she said . that small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , schiavo said . a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said . the crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened . `` our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in europe , especially the people of germany and spain , following the terrible airplane crash in france , '' u.s. president barack obama told reporters . `` it 's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children , some of them infants . '' germany 's merkel said she was sending two ministers to france on tuesday and would travel to the crash site on wednesday to see it for herself . `` we have to think of the victims and their families and their friends , '' she said . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the german government had set up a crisis center in response to the `` terrible news '' and was in close contact with the french authorities . `` in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew , '' he said . cnn 's mariano castillo , hala gorani , laura akhoun , stephanie halasz , lindsay isaac , josh levs , richard greene , karl penhaul and sara delgrossi contributed to this report .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- cabinet-maker michael ibsen has just put the finishing touches to a coffin ; built of highly-polished , honey-colored english oak and yew , it has been a labor of love , pondered over and painstakingly crafted . because this is n't any ordinary commission : the casket will be the final resting place of one of ibsen 's distant relatives , richard iii , who died more than 500 years ago . `` it is a unique privilege , '' says canadian-born ibsen , whose dna was used to establish the identity of the english king , found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of leicester in august 2012 . `` there 's a wonderful serendipity in a sense that someone involved in the identification of the remains should happen to be furniture maker who can do this . `` when you 're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood , but at the end of the day when you stand back and think ` i 'm building richard iii 's coffin , ' it 's incredible . '' ibsen says he 's been on an `` extraordinary journey '' in the two-and-a-half years since he gave a dna swab to genetics specialist turi king on the off chance that experts searching for the burial place of his seventeen-times great-uncle might strike it lucky . back then even the man in charge of the dig , archaeologist richard buckley , did n't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he 'd `` eat his hat '' if they turned up the long-lost king 's remains . `` when we were planning the project , i never made any secret of the fact i thought it very unlikely we 'd be successful , '' buckley told cnn . `` the chances of hitting the right spot were very slim . '' call it a fluke , or call it fate , but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately : richard iii 's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig , in the first trench dug by the team . at the time , all the experts knew was that they 'd found a set of leg bones , chopped off at the feet by building work at some point in the intervening centuries . it was n't until days later , as archaeologist jo appleby carefully exhumed the rest of the skeleton that she spotted the distinct curve of its spine , and the devastating damage medieval weapons had left on its skull . for philippa langley , founder of the `` looking for richard '' project , who stood watching with bated breath as the bones were uncovered , the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the king 's remains -- and to look again at his reputation . say the name richard iii to many people , and the image which will spring to mind is that of shakespeare 's villain , hunchbacked and murderous , who met a grisly end on the battlefield at bosworth after killing his nephews , the princes in the tower . years of research had convinced langley of two things : firstly , that his remains lay underneath a car park , in what had once been the grey friars ' monastery , and secondly , that he was much-maligned , the victim of bitter tudor propaganda after his death . two-and-a-half years on , langley believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since , have forced a rethink of richard iii 's story . `` as a writer my view of richard has always been that he was a very complex , very conflicted , very flawed individual -- that 's the human condition : we are all flawed , complex , conflicted -- but there was something heroic about him , he was courageous on and off the battlefield , '' she explains . she says dna evidence that the king was blue eyed and fair haired -- in contrast to portraits and written descriptions which painted him `` as a hunchback , with a withered arm and a crippled gait , with ` evil ' dark eyes and hair '' -- had `` blow -lsb- n -rsb- the mythology out of the window . '' `` it makes people question , drop their preconceptions , forget their assumptions , and go back to the beginning , '' she says . this weekend , richard iii 's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the university of leicester , where it has been kept since it was found , and be taken back to bosworth , scene of his death in 1485 , for a commemoration ceremony , before being returned to leicester ahead of its reburial next week . and while his body last made that trip slung unceremoniously over the back of a horse , this time the journey will be done in style : carried in the coffin made by his great-nephew . inside , the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose , representing the house of york , richard iii 's family -- sewn by children from leicester 's king richard iii infant school . `` i feel very proud because i 've never made a bag for a king before , '' said xi chen , who helped make the pouches . `` it 's like i 'm a servant doing something for a king , '' added his classmate irfan sheikh . lead conservation specialist jon castleman -- who previously helped to restore the dome of the rock in jerusalem -- will be the last person to set eyes on the skeleton , as he welds the ossuary inside the casket shut . well-wishers are expected to line the route as the cortege winds through the leicestershire countryside , stopping at several churches along the way for prayers and religious services before making its way back to leicester cathedral , near the site of the archaeological dig , where a new tomb has been built for the king . historian john ashdown-hill , who discovered the genealogical link between richard iii and michael ibsen , says it is important that the king 's catholic beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies . ashdown-hill , who shares richard iii 's faith , has had a rosary , featuring the white yorkist rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by richard iii 's mother , made to be placed inside the coffin . for langley , the procession and celebrations are key to repairing past damage . `` the ethos and aim of the project was to give richard what he did n't get in 1485 , '' she says . `` the reason we wanted to do that was to recognize what went on in the past but not repeat it , to make peace with history . ''

sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- in just a few weeks , good relations with neighbors have become a matter of survival for yemen 's president abdu rabu mansour hadi . on saturday , he joined his allies in egypt , while battles raged on in his country . after houthi rebels occupied the capital sanaa weeks ago , his government fled . when hadi called for military intervention to beat back their attempt to overthrow him , adjacent countries answered with a grand airstrike operation . in the darkness of early saturday , their jets increased the hail of ordnance on sanaa , as saudi led operation al-hazm storm went into its third day . and hadi waited in sharm el-sheikh , egypt to meet with the region 's leaders at the arab league summit . this past `` night was by far the scariest night since the raids started , '' said journalist hakim almasmari in sanaa . `` the strikes were so strong and continuous . '' the jets bombarded hadi 's weapons caches and other military assets , houthi and yemeni government officials said . saudi arabia has blockaded the houthis , effectively cutting off their supply lines , and its air force controls yemeni airspace . saudi arabia and egypt have spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground . the arab league is expected to give its official blessing to al-hazm storm on saturday , which could clear the way for a ground invasion , cnn 's becky anderson reported . but a few member nations , such as shiite majority iraq or possibly algeria , could give military action a thumbs down . though the saudi kingdom has taken the lead with some 100 warplanes , the coalition partners include the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , sudan and egypt . arab spring was n't supposed to turn out like this . together they comprise about a third of the arab league 's membership . they are majority sunni muslim nations , and the houthi rebels are shiite muslims allied with iran . having yemen become an iranian satellite country on its border would be perceived as a major threat by neighboring saudi arabia , which sees the houthis as proxies of tehran , saudi arabia 's bitter rival on the persian gulf . iran has sharply denounced the armed intervention . the united states , on the other hand , strongly approves of it and is supporting it logistically , and aiding coalition forces in locating targets , but it is not participating in active battle . a small contingency of u.s. forces had been stationed in yemen to help in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , but left once houthi rebels took the capital . dozens of people have died in the strikes , and on saturday , human rights watch said many of the victims were civilians , perhaps as many as 34 . `` reports of air strikes and anti-aircraft weapons in heavily populated areas raise serious concerns that not enough is being done to ensure their safety , '' hrw regional spokesman joe stork said . a saudi arabia defense official blamed civilian deaths on the houthis , saying they were using them as human shields . brig. gen. ahmed bin hasan asiri said the kingdom 's military was using precision weapons to avoid collateral damage , state-run saudi news agency reported . media outlets have come under fire as well . an hour after hadi ordered the closure of all houthi-controlled media -- including yemen tv and saba tv -- houthis raided two tv channels and the prominent al masdar newspaper . al jazeera 's office in sanaa was also targeted , the qatar-based network said , with houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment . opinion : why yemen has come undone . journalist hakim almasmari reported from yemen , and cnn 's ben brumfield wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's becky anderson , salma abdelaziz and mustafa al-arab contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- nigeria 's military says its forces have retaken the northeastern town of gwoza , which boko haram militants last year declared the headquarters of their `` caliphate . '' the announcement comes on the eve of the west african country 's general elections . `` just this morning , the gallant troops of the nigerian military in a concerted and well-coordinated land and air operations have liberated gwoza , the headquarters of their so-called caliphate , '' major general chris olukolade said in a defense ministry statement friday . olukolade said the troops had routed boko haram fighters in towns and villages leading to gwoza . `` several of the terrorists have died and many of them captured in the process . a lot of arms and ammunition have been recovered and the administrative headquarters completely destroyed . a massive cordon and search has commenced to locate any of the fleeing terrorists or hostages in their custody , '' olukolade said . boko haram declared its own `` caliphate '' after seizing the area around gwoza , in borno state , in august 2014 , according to the chatham house think tank . the militant group has purportedly pledged allegiance to isis and says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across nigeria , which is split between the majority muslim north and the mostly christian south . nigeria 's general elections take place saturday . the polls had been scheduled for february 14 , but on february 7 , nigeria 's election commission announced they would be postponed for six weeks due to security concerns , with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by boko haram . the controversial decision was unpopular among many nigerians and led to widespread protests . nigerian president goodluck jonathan , who is running for reelection , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat boko haram . on friday , jonathan referenced the gwoza victory in a broadcast to the nation , praising nigeria 's armed forces for their `` immense sacrifices '' in defending the nation . `` we are also glad that our gallant armed forces have successfully stemmed the seizure of nigerian territories in the northeast by the terrorist group , boko haram , '' jonathan said . `` they have recaptured most of the communities and territories formerly occupied by the insurgents , making it possible for thousands of internally displaced nigerians to begin returning to their homes and communities . '' jonathan said security agencies were fully prepared to deal decisively with `` any group or persons who attempt to disrupt the peaceful conduct of the elections . '' `` those who may harbor any intentions of testing our will by unleashing violence during the elections in order to advance their political ambitions should think again as all necessary measures have been put in place to ensure that any persons who breach the peace or cause public disorder during or after the elections are speedily apprehended and summarily dealt with according to our laws , '' the president said . on thursday , jonathan and maj. gen. muhammad buhari , the other leading presidential candidate , issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to `` free , fair and credible elections '' following their signing of a nonviolence pledge -- the abuja accord -- in january . the international criminal court also issued a warning that anyone inciting or engaging in electoral violence `` at a time when abhorrent levels of violence already plague parts of the country '' is subject to prosecution , `` either by nigerian courts or by the icc . '' `` no one should doubt my office 's resolve to prosecute individuals responsible for the commission of icc crimes , whenever necessary , '' icc chief prosecutor fatou bensouda said in the statement . boko haram attacks have killed at least 1,000 civilians so far this year , according to a human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- statement released thursday . citing interviews with witnesses , it said the militants rounded up 300 gwoza residents when it overran the town , then took them to a camp in the sambisa forest . `` after five months during which other residents remained trapped on the hills , hiding in caves and weakened by hunger , boko haram attacked the civilians there , killing many and forcing others to escape over the border into cameroon , '' the rights group said . `` each week that passes we learn of more brutal boko haram abuses against civilians , '' said hrw researcher mausi segun , adding that nigeria `` needs to make protecting civilians a priority in military operations against boko haram . '' the rights group said nigerian security forces had `` failed to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population '' when fighting boko haram but noted that , according to the government , military police were investigating those claims . amnesty international said in september that reports of alleged abuses by nigerian security forces had increased since the government stepped up its fight against boko haram . the rights group alleged systemic use of torture by the police , based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over a 10-year span . a spokesman for the nigeria police force disputed the claims , saying torture and abuse were not `` repeat , not an official policy of the nigeria police '' and that the amnesty report contained `` some blatant falsehoods . '' earlier this month , isis purportedly said it welcomed boko haram after the latter pledged allegiance to it . in an audio message purportedly from an isis spokesman , the group announced that it had accepted a pledge of allegiance from boko haram . isis supporters posted the audio online . cnn can not independently authenticate the 28-minute message . the message said that isis , which calls itself the islamic state , had expanded to west africa and congratulated `` our jihadi brothers '' there . it followed the posting online of an unauthenticated audio message purportedly from boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , on march 9 in which the speaker announced that the terror group wanted to join isis . since 2009 , boko haram , whose name translates as `` western education is sin , '' has waged a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of sharia law in nigeria . boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques . much of this violence has taken place in nigeria . but neighboring countries , such as cameroon and chad , have also been hit increasingly hard and have committed troops to fight the militants . an african union-mandated multinational joint task force has also been formed , involving troops from cameroon , chad , niger and benin as well as nigeria . on friday , the uk foreign office announced britain would provide 5 million pounds -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to help the task force tackle boko haram . foreign secretary philip hammond expressed hope that the united nations security council would adopt a resolution , currently being negotiated , to endorse the task force . nana karikari-apau contributed to this report from atlanta and susannah cullinane wrote from london . christian purefoy contributed from lagos .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in washington , we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many americans were afraid had gone extinct : real live no-joke bipartisanship . heavyweights from both parties are attending the march 26 bipartisan summit on criminal justice reform . the event is co-produced by gingrich productions -lrb- on the right -rrb- and by my project , #cut50 -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years . attorney general eric holder will be speaking . so will newt gingrich , the republican former house speaker . sen. cory booker , d-new jersey , will be there . so will democratic strategist and cnn commentator donna brazile , a co-host of the summit . republican power players like former texas gov. rick perry , ohio gov. john kasich and sen. mike lee , r-utah , will address the gathering by video . so will president obama . progressives like myself will rub shoulders with representatives from koch industries . everyone keeps asking me , `` how is this possible ? '' i have five words for you : `` liberty and justice for all . '' the ever-expanding incarceration industry has begun to violate some of the deepest and most sacred principles of both major political parties . therefore , conservatives , libertarians and liberals have their own objective interests in reform -- and their own values-based incentives to make real changes . for example , the right takes very seriously the concept of `` liberty . '' conservatives and libertarians want to defend the rights of every individual to pursue his or her dreams . they favor limited government . they hate massive , failed , bloated government bureaucracies that suck up more and more money and get more and more power , no matter how badly they perform . in america today , we have 5 % of the world 's population -- but we have nearly 25 % of the world 's incarcerated people . nearly 1 in 100 american adults is behind bars . one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is caged in america 's prisons and jails . and most people come out more damaged , more hopeless and less able to thrive than when they went in . -lrb- so much for `` corrections '' ! -rrb- . that 's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty . on the other hand , progressives like me care passionately about the `` justice for all '' part -- including racial justice and social justice . we are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate . we oppose a system that forever tars people as `` felons , '' deemed permanently unfit for employment or the right to vote , possibly because of one mistake , early in life . when any system violates the principles of both `` liberty '' and `` justice , '' americans of all stripes should stand together to change it . that is exactly what is starting to happen . this year , we are seeing the birth of an honest-to-goodness `` liberty and justice for all '' coalition . still struggling to believe me ? i was on `` anderson cooper 360 '' on monday night to discuss the movement for criminal justice reform . here is a quote : . `` a lot of kids i grew up with , grammar school , middle school , high school , were in prison . they were the poor kids and they had drug addictions . they had drug problems , they did n't have any money , they got caught , and they got caught in the poverty cycle , and they are at the bottom of society and they ca n't get out of it . ... people with drug problems , people who have mental illnesses , they probably should n't be in the criminal justice system . and people who make mistakes , let 's not write them off forever , let 's give them a chance to reintegrate and reenter society . '' there is just one catch : i 'm not the one who said that . that is a direct quote from mark holden , senior vice president of koch industries . on practically every other issue , the koch brothers and i are still fierce opponents . i doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy , campaign finance reform , environmental rules or the keystone pipeline , to name a few . but on criminal justice reform , it 's different . mark speaks eloquently about the way the criminal justice system violates the bill of rights and criminalizes behaviors that should not result in prison terms . and he is not alone , on the right . fiscal conservatives decry the money wasted on a system that is too expensive and produces poor results . that 's one reason that red-state governors , like georgia 's nathan deal , have acted boldly . leaders with roots on the religious right , including summit co-host pat nolan , insist on the christian value of redemption and second chances for those behind bars . our values may not always be identical , but they can find common expression in fixing this broken prison system . progressives and conservatives do n't have to trust each other -- or even like each other -- to vote together on this issue . usually , `` bipartisanship '' is just another word for cheap , political gamesmanship . it is too often invoked by one side , simply to gain advantage and to cloak a more narrow set of interests . but on criminal justice reform , something different is happening . criminal justice reform is the one place where many republicans , democrats and libertarians actually agree -- and are willing to work together to get something done . over the last 30 years , both parties helped lead us down the path to mass incarceration . it will take both political parties to reverse course . perhaps the march 26 bipartisan summit will represent the first major bend in the road back toward sanity .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- actress taraji p. henson is apologizing for claiming her son was racially profiled during a traffic stop in southern california last year . the glendale police department released dash cam video of the encounter friday , which contradicted her son 's claims . police released the footage after henson commented about the alleged profiling in an uptown magazine interview published last month . in her interview , the star of the hit television show `` empire '' said her son , marcell johnson , 20 , was racially profiled in glendale and at the university of southern california , where she accused campus police of stopping him for `` having his hands in his pockets . '' after her son 's claim , she vowed to send him to howard university in washington instead . `` i 'm not paying $ 50k so i ca n't sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus , '' she said . even the university of southern california stepped in , with its public safety director , john thomas , saying he was disturbed by the report of the profiling , and was investigating it further . `` we encourage reporting of allegations of bias and i hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother , '' thomas said . but henson retracted her accusations friday , and publicly apologized to the glendale police department . `` a mother 's job is not easy and neither is a police officer 's , '' she said in a post on instagram . `` sometimes as humans we overreact without gathering all of the facts . as a mother in this case i overreacted and for that i apologize . thank you to that officer for being kind to my son . '' police chief robert castro said his agency researched the traffic stop after her comments to the magazine . the incident started when a glendale officer pulled over johnson in october for failing to yield to a pedestrian at a cross walk . during the traffic stop , johnson admitted to having marijuana , an infraction and ritalin without a prescription , a felony , according to castro . he consented to a search of the vehicle , and officers found marijuana , honey oil -lrb- concentrated marijuana -rrb- , a marijuana grinder and a knife , castro said . johnson was not driving while impaired and was only cited for possession of marijuana , he said . `` misinformation that was reported in the story in uptown magazine with taraji p. henson impairs and weakens the relationships between law enforcement and the communities , '' castro said . the glendale police department said friday it appreciated henson 's apology and is sharing it with its officers .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- african safaris conjure up images of four-wheel drive cars trundling through games parks carrying tourists with binoculars clamped to their eyes . but if you want to get a bit closer to some of nature 's most beautiful beasts then heading out on four legs , not four wheels , might be your best bet . venturing into the continent 's game reserves on horseback may seem a little daunting but is one of the best ways to experience the environment , says philip kusseler , co-owner of wait a little horse safaris . kusseler has been leading outings into south africa 's karongwe and greater makalali game reserves near the famous kruger national park for more than a decade . his stable of around 40 horses at a farm in ofcolaco in the northwest of the country includes warmbloods , native boerperds and former thoroughbreds . the ex-racehorses may be more used to chasing on the turf than exploring the bush , but kusseler says that once trained they make for great tour guides . `` when you get a retired racehorse , you have extremely fit horse right from the beginning which is of course very good to work with . secondly , you get a horse that likes to excite itself and learn new things , '' kusseler told cnn 's winning post . most racehorses face an uncertain future when their track days come to an end -- usually at the age of around six or seven . a lucky few are sent to stud while others , like double gold cup winner kauto star , try their luck at different equestrian disciplines . some will see out their days at animal sanctuaries but many are simply slaughtered because owners are unable or unwilling to foot the bill for upkeep once their racing days are through . kusseler is looking to grow his current stock of three ex-racers which are prepared for their new role by his wife gerti , a former dressage rider and fei coach . `` we train all our horses in basic dressage , '' she explains . `` it 's very important that they are responsive and trust the rider and trust the aids of the rider . the basic training and dressage helps a lot to make them responsive and fun to ride as well . '' all horses spend a minimum of two years being schooled at a purpose-built riding arena at the farm and also in the bush where they learn to deal with some of nature 's most intimidating creatures . `` when an ex-racehorse sees a lion , '' explains philip kusseler , `` you can feel it 's heartbeat through the saddle but he soon learns to cope with it and they are just as cool as any other horse breed . '' `` trekking with horses is extremely dangerous because the horse fits the lions prey preference perfectly . but they are so well-trained and so well disciplined that they do n't react like a prey animal would , so the lions get quite confused . '' along with the `` big five '' game -lrb- lions , elephants , rhinos leopards and buffalo -rrb- wait a little 's intrepid guests can expect to come across zebras , wildebeests , hippos and giraffe amid 35,000 hectares of game park . but as gerti concedes , seeing these beasts up close from the saddle is not everyone 's idea of a good time . `` we have had people that were too scared . i ca n't say it 's 100 % safe because it is n't . but it is very , very safe when you go out with philip because he has such huge experience , '' she says . `` he gives his horses a lot of confidence and sometimes some horses need that . i always say the animals are the least dangerous -- the most dangerous thing is riding horses . '' of course , there are other modes of transport with anything from trains to camels ready to carry you through the bush . most tourists still opt for a traditional four-wheel drive vehicles but the kusselers would n't swap their thoroughbred horsepower for anything else . `` they are just lovely , '' says philip kusseler . `` as long as you are able to stimulate them in the bush by having wonderful outrides you will have a horse that keeps on smiling . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- former one direction member zayn malik spoke for the first time since leaving the group this week -- and said he 's sorry for the pain he 's caused . `` i feel like i 've let the fans down , but i ca n't do this anymore , '' he told the uk 's outlet the sun . `` it 's not that i 've turned my back on them or anything , it 's just that i just ca n't do that anymore , because it 's not the real me .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- charlottesville police said monday that investigators found no `` substantive basis '' to support a university of virginia female student 's story that she was raped at the phi kappa psi house , an account that rolling stone published last november . `` jackie '' told the magazine that in late september 2012 , she was assaulted at the house , the article said . police chief tim longo noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account , `` that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to jackie '' on the day in question . longo said he welcomed any information that might still be out there about the case . the rolling stone story generated controversy from the moment it came out , first sparking a debate about the prevalence of rape on college campuses throughout the country . but then the controversy turned toward the story 's content when apparent contradictions and discrepancies in the article came to light . rolling stone said it did not get the accounts of those accused in the piece , and apologized . editors vowed to conduct their own investigation , which is expected to be published in early april . longo said jackie did not give police a statement during their investigation . cnn legal analyst sunny hostin said it 's not unusual for a sexual assault victim to avoid the criminal process . `` sometimes they ca n't deal with the probing that occurs . they do n't want to submit to a rape kit . they 're embarrassed . they know that they will be scrutinized , quite frankly . so that in and of itself ... does n't make this young woman a liar , '' she said . hostin pointed out that only about 2 % of rapes that are reported are false , and only about 40 % of rapes that occur are even reported : `` so the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics . '' nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police , longo said . none of them said they knew about a rape , he said , and investigators further determined that it was unlikely a party even happened at the fraternity house on the day in question as was alleged in the rolling stone story . the rolling stone reporter , sabrina rubin erdely , talked to police , authorities said , but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons . it 's unclear what those questions were . in total , authorities spoke to 70 people as part of their investigation , and just two believed that jackie was the victim of something , capt. gary pleasants told cnn 's `` erin burnett outfront . '' `` the two of them were fairly convinced that something had happened -- not the way it was described , the way it was written . but they thought , again , that something had probably occurred , '' he said . after the story 's publication , uva suspended the fraternity 's activities , and outrage spread throughout campus as many struggled to comprehend the horrific experience that jackie said she endured . the article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault . phi kappa psi released a statement monday , saying the `` discredited '' story has done significant damage , while acknowledging the `` importance of sexual assault issues on america 's college campuses . '' the fraternity asked rolling stone to `` fully and unconditionally retract its story . '' rolling stone editors said they chose not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on jackie , or any of the men she said participated in her alleged assault , `` because the editors feared retaliation against her , '' the magazine said , adding that it regretted that decision . `` in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in jackie 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , '' rolling stone said in december . rolling stone managing editor will dana later tweeted that `` the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story . '' rolling stone issued an apology for discrepancies in its article and began to fact-check it . steve coll , dean of the columbia university graduate school of journalism , has been leading the independent review , cnn senior media correspondent brian stelter reported sunday . stelter said there has been much speculation about coll 's findings . columbia university 's review will be published in early april in the magazine . `` i ca n't really say i 'm surprised since so much of the evidence was already called into question , '' a former friend of jackie 's said in response to what police found . `` i think it 's great that they 're staying open to considering any new evidence that comes up . '' ryan duffin added : `` i 've resigned myself to realize that i might never know what did or did n't happen . '' cnn 's sara ganim and michael martinez contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- that sound you just heard was the crash of hearts breaking all over the world . zayn malik is leaving one direction . `` after five incredible years zayn malik has decided to leave one direction , '' the band said on its facebook page and tweeted out to its 22.9 million twitter followers . `` niall , harry , liam and louis will continue as a four-piece and look forward to the forthcoming concerts of their world tour and recording their fifth album , due to be released later this year . '' rumors about such a move had started since malik left the band 's tour last week . at the time , a rep told rolling stone he had `` been signed off with stress '' after a scandal erupted following the publication of a photo showing malik holding hands with someone other than his fiancee . fans on twitter immediately responded with teary vine videos and the #alwaysinourheartszaynmalik hashtag . even the girl scouts got in on the act with a sweet tribute to the singer . the band 's wikipedia page was also quickly updated with a sentence , `` zayn malik was formerly a member . '' and spotify said that global streams of one direction songs were up 330 % wednesday in the hour after the news was announced -- a `` spike of sadness , '' as the music service called it . in the u.s. alone , streams of the band 's music were up 769 % . to mark the occasion , spotify created a special playlist of 1d songs . malik , 22 , has been part of the very popular british boy band since it was formed -lrb- at the urging of simon cowell , according to some stories -rrb- in 2010 after members auditioned separately for the uk version of `` the x factor . '' cowell became a mentor and signed them to his label . the group has put out four albums , and its hits include `` best song ever '' and `` story of my life . '' their latest album , `` four , '' came out in november .
rome -lrb- cnn -rrb- as the dust settles after italy 's high court ruled on friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for amanda knox , 27 , and her former italian boyfriend raffaele sollecito , 31 , in the 2007 murder of meredith kercher , many questions still linger in the case . knox and sollecito were tried together and convicted of murder by two separate courts . but now they are free now , forever cleared . there wo n't be any civil trials like in the o.j. simpson case because , according to italian penal code , italy 's high court decision is final across all courts in the country . according to italian lawyer nicola canestrini , who works on extradition and criminal cases between italy and other countries , . `` the high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system . '' what now for the kerchers ? francesco maresca , lawyer for the kercher family , told cnn that his clients are disappointed with the final ruling . `` we expected more from the italian judicial system , '' he said . `` this is a failure to find justice for meredith . '' maresca says the kerchers could try to appeal to the european court of human rights and argue that italy failed to find those culpable of killing their beloved daughter and sister but they have yet to make that decision . `` if they think italy has n't fulfilled the duty , they could sue italy , '' canestrini told cnn . such a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to rudy guede , a man from the ivory coast who was convicted for his role in kercher 's murder in 2008 in a fast-track trial that is still under seal . when the high court ruled definitively on his case in 2010 , they wrote explicitly in their reasoning that he was one of three assailants but did not name who they were . knox and sollecito both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal . they applied to italy 's high court to be put under house arrest but because knox was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk , they were both denied . sollecito may now have cause to sue italy for false imprisonment . italy pays around $ 12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges , according to italian prime minister matteo renzi who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system . but , canestrini says if sollecito at any time lied to investigators before he was arrested , he may forfeit his right to reimbursement for being held . sollecito changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with knox , so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest . canestrini also says that knox could potentially sue italy for one year of false imprisonment , but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest , she would likely not have much of a case . `` because she initially admitted to a role in the crime , she would n't likely win . if a suspect lies to investigators before they are arrested , it is difficult to prove they were falsely imprisoned , '' canestrini says . in one of her initial interrogations in 2007 , she told investigators she was in the house when kercher was killed at which time she accused patrick lumumba , her boss at a pub where she worked , of the murder . she later recanted that statement , but lumumba spent two weeks in prison because of her false claim . in 2013 , italy 's high court ruled definitively on a slander charge against her for the false accusation and upheld a three-year prison term and ordered her to pay lumumba $ 40,000 euro . knox 's lawyer carlo dalla vedova told cnn that knox does n't feel any revenge or resentment towards italy . in fact , he said she will go back one day . `` this has been an nightmare for her , so we finally got the right decision , '' he said . `` we always thought this was the only decision possible . '' sollecito 's lawyers were equally pleased with the outcome . `` the verdict that we just received does n't prove us partly right , it proves us completely right , '' giulia bongiorno told reporters outside the court . `` there were two possible verdicts : -lrb- one was to -rrb- overturn this verdict , but go back to it later . instead , the overturn is without any referral . among all the possible and imaginable overturning options , this is the one which says `` be advised , we wo n't ever even make the hypothesis of an implication of raffaele sollecito in this case ever . enough , enough , enough . '' knox , too , made her own statement from her mother 's home in seattle after hearing the news . she thanked all those who supported her innocence , and said she needed to take time to digest what being free really means . when asked if she had a message to the kerchers about their daughter , she said , `` she deserved so much in this life . i 'm the lucky one . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- gareth bale scored twice for wales as they beat israel 3-0 in euro 2016 qualification , taking them to the top of their group and on course for a first major finals since the 1958 world cup . the real madrid striker dominated the game in the northern city of haifa , setting up arsenal 's aaron ramsay for the first goal before scoring twice in the second half to help wales easily beat an israel team who had been early pacesetters in the group . club v country . much of the build up had focused on bale . after an impressive first season at madrid he has come under attack in the spanish press for putting country before club . he was awarded 0/10 by spanish newspaper marca following barcelona 's recent 2-1 el clasico win and saw two fans attack his car as he left the ground after the match . but bale did n't appear to be showing any signs of rust as he took israel apart , a team that had n't lost a competitive game in two and a half years . `` to come out on top is amazing . the first half was very hard . we did a lot of running , closed them down well , and luckily got the goal which gave us a lot of confidence , '' bale told british broadcaster sky sports after the game . `` we came out in the second half buzzing and showed what a good team we are . '' he added . italy , czech republic held . meanwhile italy narrowly avoided defeat against bulgaria . a flurry of first half goals in sofia had given bulgaria a 2-1 lead , a lead they looked to have held on to . but late in the game brazilian-born striker eder scored on his debut to spare italy 's blushes . the czech republic also narrowly avoided defeat , against lowly latvia . vaclav pilar 's last-minute equalizer in prague was just enough to keep them top of the group , with iceland hot on their heels after a 3-0 victory against kazakhstan .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- vladimir putin is not a self-effacing man . that 's why when the russian president suddenly disappeared from view people took notice . when russian officials tried to trick the public by passing off old photos as new appearances , speculation about putin 's whereabouts went viral . hashtags such as #whereisputin and #ПутинУмер -- russian for #putinisdead -- became the tip of a giant social media iceberg , much of it streaked with dark humor . in ukraine , the neighboring state besieged by putin 's forces , someone reportedly left a large funeral wreath at the gate of the russian embassy . a handwritten message addressed putin with an expletive , telling him , `` thank you for croaking . '' the fast-moving iceberg of speculation may melt as fast as it emerged . the kremlin has now started pushing harder against the rumors , trying to prove that russia 's foremost -- nay , only -- major political leader , is alive and well . early on friday , officials released what they said was a picture of putin taken the day of . but on social media , onlookers accused officials of dusting off old images . those keeping track insist putin has not been seen since march 5 . regardless of how or when this speculation ends , it tells us much about the political realities of russia . this whole thing started after putin 's trip to kazakhstan was canceled on wednesday and a kazakh official told a reporter that the russian president had fallen ill . then the kremlin released a picture of putin speaking with the leader of the republic of karelia . but it turns out that happened on march 4 . on thursday , putin 's spokesman , dmitry peskov , said the president would miss his regular meeting with the federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- . when asked about his boss 's health , peskov said he is `` absolutely healthy , '' his handshake so strong he could `` break your hand . '' to illustrate the point , the kremlin 's russia today posted a picture of the mighty president slamming a judo opponent hard against the ground . peskov says russia is in the grips of a `` spring fever '' that is causing people to dream up harebrained scenarios . amateur sleuths and creative minds have speculated wildly about putin 's health problems . the swiss magazine blick said putin is in lugano , where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby . some have said he has cancer ; others report a heart attack or a stroke . there are even suggestions that he went off to join isis , or is playing hide-and-seek a la where 's waldo . does putin ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the kremlin does n't want to allow putin 's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans . that 's hardly surprising . putin is not your average president . on paper , russia is a democracy . but no objective observer believes that . putin is the state . every important decision is made by him . putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult . his approval ratings are stratospheric , even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement . approval ratings nearing 90 % are the product of suppression of dissent and media maneuvers demonizing , ridiculing , and ultimately silencing critics . the system requires propaganda and image control . it needs putin to be larger than life . the recent murder of boris nemtsov , putin 's foremost critic , has spawned fears that there is a hit list , a roster of putin critics whose days are numbered . there are rampant rumors of intrigue inside the kremlin . the level of fear is said to be higher than it has been in years . the term `` kremlinology '' became the study of intrigue and power machinations in inscrutably dark systems . russia has a long history of concealing the illnesses of its leaders . in the soviet era , some mysterious disappearances were followed by funerals . in those days , there was usually a succession plan . and in the post-stalin days , the passing of one leader meant that the party chose the next strongman . in 1991 , the last ussr leader , mikhail gorbachev , went to his summer home in crimea . he was visited by a group of high-ranking soviet officials . the next day , the russian people were told that gorbachev was ill , and could not perform his duties . gorbachev was held against his will . there was a coup in progress . putin 's mentor , president boris yeltsin , also had a history of `` disappearing '' from view . he was really ill and/or drunk . even if putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity , talk of putin 's disappearance raises important questions . what would russia become if he suddenly left power ? is there a successor in place ? is there anyone who would continue putin 's policies ? if there is a power vacuum , a conceivable scenario given just how thoroughly putin dominates , what would the consequences be ? whatever putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers , visiting with friends , or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead , the internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today 's russian state , who dismantled the country 's once-fledgling democracy , wo n't be around forever . which raises the question , what then ?
tunis , tunisia -lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands of demonstrators marched in tunisia 's capital sunday , protesting against terrorism less than two weeks after gunmen attacked a museum and killed more than 20 people there . `` we came to express our support and to fight this danger that 's threatening our society and our stability , '' said rafik abdessalem , tunisia 's former foreign minister , who was among the crowd . `` fortunately , all tunisians are united here today . we will be able to defeat terrorism , which is threatening tunisia and all the neighboring countries . '' as a heavy police presence stood guard , tunisian president beji caid essebsi marched alongside dignitaries and world leaders , including french president francois hollande and italian prime minister matteo renzi , who led the crowd to the steps of the bardo museum . protesters held banners that said `` we are not afraid '' and `` je suis bardo '' as they chanted `` tunisia is free , and out with terrorism . '' on march 18 , the art , culture and history museum was the site of a drastically different scene , as gunmen opened fire on tourists in a siege that also forced the evacuation of the neighboring parliament . isis claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online the next day . hours before sunday 's demonstration began , tunisia 's prime minister announced that algerian national khaled shayeb , the alleged architect of the museum assault , was one of nine suspected militants killed in a raid in the south of the country . arab spring aftermath : revolutions give way to violence , more unrest . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .
lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- a few months before nigeria 's national elections , both main candidates embraced and promised a peaceful election . that pledge is now under serious threat . protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in nigeria 's oil-rich rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect nigeria 's next president . `` there 's been so much violence in rivers state that it 's just not tenable , '' said lai mohammed , spokesman for the main opposition party , the all peoples congress . the all peoples congress says the vote has been rigged , voters intimidated and demanded that the elections held in rivers state be canceled . the ruling party , the peoples democratic party , refutes the accusation , saying the election was `` credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of rivers state to support president goodluck jonathan . '' heavy rain eventually forced the protesters home , but there are fears that it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence . `` we are concerned by what seems to be happening , '' said attahiru jega , nigeria 's election chairman , about events in rivers state . nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule . the two main candidates are incumbent president goodluck jonathan and retired general muhammedu buhari . what is at stake in the protests in rivers state is not whether nigeria can hold an election , but can it hold a `` close '' election . voting is now over and the results are being counted . jega says the final result will likely be announced within 48 hours . the fear is that the results may not be accepted by whomever loses . and if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party , then the protests in rivers state could spread to northern nigeria . over 800 people were killed in post-election violence across the north after the 2011 elections were thought to be illegitimate . and so both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm . `` i want to urge all nigerians to also wait patiently for the independent national electoral commission , inec , to collate and announce results , '' stated jonathan on his facebook account . `` fellow nigerians , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced , '' said buhari on twitter .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- there were screams . then the sounds of a commercial jetliner slamming into the mountainside . and finally silence . deathly silence . that much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on germanwings flight 9525 . beyond that , it 's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the alps . none of them can speak for themselves , nor can any of the flight 's six crew members . but authorities have given some clues , based on what investigators know about the aircraft 's trajectory and what they 've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site . it all began on what seemed like most any other tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the germanwings plane in barcelona , spain . the passengers came from all walks of life , using lufthansa 's low-cost carrier to get to dusseldorf , germany . they were high school students , heading home after a week in spain . they were parents and children enjoying their vacation . there were businessmen , scouting out store locations . there was a 26-minute delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers did n't give the ok to start the plane 's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation , according to lufthansa . for any frequent flier , that kind of delay is nothing abnormal . nor , it seems , was takeoff . the airbus a320 left and headed northeast at 10:01 a.m. -lrb- 5:01 a.m. et -rrb- on what should have been a 726-mile journey . the plane leveled off at 38,000 feet , its cruising altitude . by this point , passengers would be ok to unbuckle , head to the restroom or get their bags out of the overhead bin . a seemingly innocuous act changed everything : the aircraft 's pilot had to use the restroom , according to lufthansa ceo carsten spohr , telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out . it 's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin , going to or from the restroom . they also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half-hour into a nearly two-hour flight , with the alps ahead of them . the passengers could n't have known it , but the co-pilot -- identified as 28-year-old andreas lubitz -- `` manipulated the buttons of the flight monitoring system to activate the descent of the aircraft '' while the pilot was out , marseille prosecutor brice robin said thursday . this was around 10:45 a.m. . it was n't like the plane suddenly jerked down , plunging straight into the ground . authorities described a steady descent at a rate of about 3,000 to 3,500 feet -lrb- or roughly 1,000 meters -rrb- per minute . still , it is the kind of descent you 'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the alps . if passengers did n't notice that fall , they might have caught wind of what was happening at the front of the plane . students , singers among the victims . inside the cockpit , the only sound was that of lubitz breathing steadily . but outside the cockpit , the noises apparently grew louder and more frantic . the pilot tried to open the door but could n't get in . he likely knocked on the door . he used a video conference system to talk to the co-pilot , robin said . none of it worked . nor did his last-ditch attempt , as recounted by a senior french military official involved in the crash investigation to the new york times . `` you can hear he is trying to smash the door down , '' the official said . did the passengers hear this commotion upfront ? it 's hard to imagine they did n't . and if that was n't reason enough to cause worry , they just had to look outside -- at the mountain chain that should have been far below them instead of getting closer and closer and closer . the voice recorder did n't indicate any abnormal noise in the cabin until the final few moments . still , even if the passengers did n't know it at the time , all it took was eight minutes for a seemingly normal flight to become a nightmare . the nightmare ended in a violent crash into rugged , remote terrain . so did the screams and the lives of all 150 people on flight 9525 -- a death that robin described as `` instantaneous . '' who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ?

-lrb- cnn -rrb- seven college-age people , some who came to panama city beach , florida , for spring break , were wounded in a late-night shooting , the bay county sheriff 's office said in a press release . officers met `` complete chaos '' when they tried to find out what happened not long after midnight friday , sheriff frank mckeithen told cnn affiliate wmbb when interviewed on the scene . video showed the streets teeming with young people . three people with gunshot wounds were found inside a house , one outside the house , one in the median of the road and two on the other side of the road , the sheriff 's office said in a press release . `` we have about 100 witnesses or so that we are trying to separate and interview , '' mckeithen told wmbb . `` we have a mess . '' the scene was so mixed up that deputies from five adjacent counties and officers from the florida highway patrol and panama city beach police were called in to assist . the shooting occurred at a residence on thomas drive , the main drag in the beach town . several of the victims were students from alabama a&m university who were visiting town for spring break , the sheriff 's office said . they 're between 20 and 22 years of age . during february and march , up to six million young people visit panama city beach , which some have been dubbed `` the spring break capital of the world .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- kentucky is so awesome right now you are probably watching the ncaa men 's basketball tournament to see who is going to get second . the undefeated wildcats were scary good thursday night in crushing west virginia . the score was so lopsided the game was over before the first television timeout . while the wildcats won in a blowout , notre dame and wisconsin also advanced to the elite eight with less-than-comfortable wins . the fighting irish pulled away from wichita state while the badgers shook off pesky north carolina . during the nightcap a lot of televisions -- outside the commonwealth of kentucky -- probably changed channels . the good news was arizona and xavier played a terrific game in the final contest of the night . perhaps you should n't provoke the beast that is kentucky . in the week leading up to the game , west virginia 's daxter miles said , `` i give them them their props . salute them getting to 36-0 . but tomorrow they 're gon na be 36-1 . '' mr. miles missed his guaranteed win by miles . the wildcats smoked the mountaineers 78-39 thursday night in a midwest region contest that was never a contest . kentucky raced to an 18-2 lead -- they should have stopped it then -- and had five players score in double figures on the night . trey lyles was the wildcats ' top scorer with 14 points . west virginia could n't guard anyone , except maybe the official who went down when he tripped over a mountaineer waiting at the scoring table . kentucky 's 37-0 record is the best start in ncaa history , which has kentucky superfan ashley judd super excited . it was n't a pretty game for the wildcats ' offense , but arizona scratched its way past xavier 68-60 in a west region semifinal . arizona shot 40 percent , while xavier was n't much better at 43 percent . the wildcats tightened their defense toward the end , closing out with a 19-7 run that pushed them to a win and a meeting saturday with wisconsin . it 's a rematch of an elite 8 game last year , which the badgers won by one point . t.j. mcconnell topped all arizona scorers with 17 points while matt stainbrook led xavier with 17 points . the irish found the right balance in the second half , putting the shockers away for a 81-70 victory in the midwest region . notre dame trailed by 1 with 16:43 left when it went on a spurt that saw six different players score as the lead grew to double digits . demetrius jackson , who started the run with back-to-back three-pointers , led the irish with 20 points . two-sport star pat connaughton had 16 . steve vasturia , who one cbs analyst called a baby-faced assassin , chipped in 13 points . jerian grant , a national player of the year candidate , had a rough night shooting , so he set up his teammates for buckets instead . he had nine points but 11 assists . junior fred vanvleet led the shockers with 25 points while darius carter maneuvered inside for 22 . wisconsin played cool and shot hot from the free-throw line in holding off north carolina 79-72 . sam decker was trending on twitter but the tar heels were concerned about sam dekker -lrb- two ks , folks ! -rrb- , the wisconsin forward who was n't having any trouble scoring against the fourth-seeded tar heels . dekker , who was guarded by the heels ' best defender , j.p. tokoto , sliced his way for 15 first-half points to keep the badgers in the game . the junior had a career-high 23 points on the night while frank kaminsky , one of the best players in the country , struggled . but the 7-foot tall center hit a big three and big free throws as the minutes wound down . the badgers were 20 for 23 from the free throw line . kaminsky hit all eight of his attempts . folks also got worked up over seeing green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers and actress girlfriend olivia munn at the game . seems like tbs cut to a shot of the two at every break in the action . how 'd you like to be the guy next to rodgers ? he won two u.s. open golf titles , yet is n't famous enough to get all the way in the celebrity fan shot . it 's ok , andy north .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- sen. harry 's reid 's perfunctory announcement on friday that he wo n't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the senate democrats -- was followed , hours later , by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with the washington post : `` i think schumer should be able to succeed me . '' that would usher in a whirlwind of activity on capitol hill in the next year as new york 's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond . left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block chuck schumer 's rise . the progressive organization democracy for america is calling for sen. elizabeth warren to seek the leadership post , and the left-leaning daily kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing schumer as too close to the `` wall street wing '' of the democratic party . with more than a year to go before senate democrats will choose a new leader , anything can happen . but after watching schumer in action for more than 20 years , i 'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create . with more than $ 13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers , schumer has more money than all but one member of the senate -- and is the only democrat in the top 10 in that category . he ran the democratic senatorial campaign committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012 , the field looks far more promising for them in 2016 : republicans must defend 24 seats , while democrats need to protect only 10 . schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight . even among the 100-member senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues . republican bob dole , a longtime lion of the senate , once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the capitol is between schumer and a television camera . the joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life . schumer is attuned to television and radio -lrb- growing up in the world 's media capital will do that -rrb- . in fact , he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on sunday , a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the monday newspapers . but he is also a consummate street politician : at 64 , he maintains a habit of biking around new york city neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage , quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade . when a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of new york state , schumer did her one better , and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in . -lrb- he visits every county in the state every year . -rrb- . schumer is n't the only politically ambitious kid from brooklyn -- before attending harvard , he graduated from a public school , james madison high , whose alumni include supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg , sen. bernie sanders and ex-sen . norm coleman of minnesota -lrb- a childhood pal of schumer 's -rrb- . but schumer 's political climb been a long-term work in progress . he emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , a law that banned assault weapons ; in the run-up to the final vote , new yorkers practically could n't turn on television without seeing schumer , then a congressman , on the floor of the house , waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban . the higher profile served him well a few years later , when schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent sen. alfonse d'amato . as a senator on the rise , schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor . a very partial list of those includes howard wolfson , phil singer and blake zeff , who went on to help run hillary clinton 's 2008 campaign ; ben lawsky , who is now shaking up the world of finance as new york 's top banking regulator ; preet bharara , who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a u.s. attorney ; and rodney capel , who is executive director of the state 's democratic party . with allies , money and the blessing of reid , schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book , `` positively american , '' which lays out a vision for how democrats should lead america . like schumer himself , the book is savvy , hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters . those who wonder what a schumer senate leadership would look like should take a look as democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the schumer era on capitol hill .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it is now generally accepted that germanwings first officer andreas lubitz did indeed lock his captain out of the cockpit , put their airplane into a steep descent , and then sit back and wait calmly for the end to arrive . he did it with premeditation , having discarded a doctor 's note that would have excused him from work that day . he joins the short and infamous list of airline pilots , a handful over the past two decades , who have used their airplanes to combine suicide with mass murder . why is this thought at once so fascinating and so horrifying ? it is because of the incompatibility between what we want to believe about flying and what we now see . air travel presents itself as a highly controlled , stringently professional activity , stripped of every unpredictable element . flight crews wear military-style uniforms not because they could not fly equally well in street clothes , but because uniforms convey to passengers a subliminal suggestion that they are of a different breed , as far from ordinary folk as a world-class athlete is from a duffer . not only are pilots smarter and better-trained than ordinary people , those stripes and caps say , but they also must be less forgetful than we , less distractible , better rested , not prone to irritability or sadness or smoldering resentments . like soldiers , they must be just a little bit robotic , efficient , brave and purified of the trash that infests the souls of common humans . because they have earned their stripes , we feel safe -- even when it seems impossible for us to understand , or apparently for anyone to explain , what keeps those huge metal contraptions up in the air . the truth , as the voluminous history of airplane accidents reveals , is that pilots are not different from other people . they can be careless , lazy , inattentive and reckless . they can drink too much . when pilots talk among themselves , the mistakes , the close calls , the disasters averted by sheer luck are favorite topics . but if pilots slip up in little ways from time to time , the sweeping drama of aviation , in which they are the actors and we the audience , eclipses their faults . besides , most flying is routine -- hours of boredom , the cliché goes , punctuated by moments of sheer terror . the glitches have long since been ironed out , and the airplanes are so wonderfully engineered that they usually protect even the worst pilot from himself . nor are pilots of a higher moral type than the rest of us . despite the pieties they occasionally utter , pilots do not consciously shoulder the burden of hundreds of lives or feel more responsible for a full airplane than for an empty one . pilots , by and large , are proud . they identify with the airplane ; it is an extension and enlargement of the self , and the pilot feels the same motive to deliver it safely to its destination as you feel when driving a car on a crowded freeway . a pilot values a smooth landing because it demonstrates skill , not because the people in back are still alive . the greatest guarantee you have that your pilot is devoted to your safety is the fact that he or she is in the airplane with you . so we should not be overly astonished if from time to time a pilot does something completely incompatible with our confidence . pilots are drawn from the diverse pool of human types . the human mind is the blackest of boxes ; no one , neither colleague nor psychologist , can reliably peer inside it . desperate , cataclysmic acts occur almost daily all over the world ; why should they not occur , once in a long while , in cockpits ? perhaps , with time , we will understand better who andreas lubitz was and what he did . today , we still know very little .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- from the community of montoursville , pennsylvania , u.s.a. , to the community of haltern am see , germany : . we offer our heartfelt condolences for the pain you must be feeling at this time after the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the horrendous crash of germanwings flight 9525 . there are no words of comfort that we could express that would ever be adequate . we know something about this sorrow . almost 19 years ago our community lost 16 high school french club students , along with five chaperones , in the crash of twa flight 800 off the coast of long island , new york . it is impossible to be prepared for such a horrific tragedy that touches so many so personally . during the dark hours of waiting for word of possible survivors from flight 800 , the pain for the family members was excruciating . as word came that there were no survivors , that all hope was extinguished , the anguish became almost unbearable . students , former students , teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they did n't know where else to go to find consolation . local pastors , priests , teachers and counselors were also gathering at the school to offer whatever comfort could be offered in such a moment . within hours , phone calls began pouring in from former students and teachers who were now living outside the area , offering condolences and prayers for all . since the disaster occurred over water , the recovery of loved ones took days , and even weeks in some cases . positive identification of each individual lost took even longer , which only added to the anguish . the identifications came in one at a time over a period of several days ; the waiting was nearly impossible to bear . school was not in session during the summer months , so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time . a community prayer service was arranged and held in the high school gymnasium to provide a place to weep together , and to share each other 's pain . local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members , and this continued for several months . some struggled so deeply that professional counseling was suggested . because we are a community of about 5,000 with just one high school , almost everyone opened their arms of support to those in deepest need by providing meals , baby-sitting , housecleaning and laundry services . funeral services were held one at a time , some in the high school and others in local churches . long lines of mourners waited in silence for the opportunity to at least offer condolences to family members . twenty-one funeral services over a period of several days left many in the community without any more tears to cry . within a couple of months , a memorial service was held on the local athletic field and attended by thousands . the hope was to bring closure for the community so it could attempt to return to a somewhat normal daily routine . this helped for some , but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them . when a parent , or someone serving as a parent , loses a child , an empty spot occurs in the heart that never heals . they may find comfort in the thought that their child is in the arms of a loving god , but that assurance does not mend the broken heart . over time , the various families that lost their children in the tragedy formed support groups to share their loss . many of the folks have reached out to others going through a similar type of loss to offer their comfort , and have found a little bit of personal healing in the process . in the years since the crash , many of the pastors and priests who served the families have moved away or retired from pastoral service . those of us who counseled from the beginning have at times needed the support of one another to restore our strength and spirits to then be able to serve our own parishioners . this is the beginning of a very long journey for all those willing to serve those in such great pain at this time . at this writing i am shedding tears just recalling the events that started almost 19 years ago . if any of our experiences can assist your community of haltern am see in getting through this horrible event , then know that it is in pain we achieve our greatest victories .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- isis apparently claimed responsibility thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country 's capital , a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the arab spring and stirred questions about militants in the country . in an audio statement posted online thursday , isis identified two men -- abu zakariya al-tunisi and abu anas al-tunisi -- it said used `` automatic weapons and hand grenades '' to kill and injure what it called `` crusaders and apostates '' in the bardo museum in tunis . tunisian health minister said aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed , including at least one who died at a hospital overnight . and that bloodshed , the isis message warned , is `` just the start . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . a u.s. official told cnn there is no reason to doubt the claim 's authenticity . that said , american officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on , including the extent to which it 's tied to the group calling itself the islamic state . the current u.s. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local `` franchise '' adherents to isis , rather than centrally directed by the islamist extremist group 's leadership , which is now thought to be in syria . the two attackers were carrying explosives , tunisian president beji caid essebsi said in an interview thursday with the french broadcaster tf1 . he credited tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because `` terrible explosives were found on these -lrb- attackers -rrb- and they did n't have time to use them . '' tunisia has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the arab spring . but the north african nation is not without its issues , including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 tunisians -- thought to have gone to iraq and syria to fight as jihadists than any other country , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london . authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with wednesday 's attack , including four directly linked to the bloodshed , according to a statement from essebsi . earlier thursday , tunisian prime minister habib essid identified two suspects , yassine labidi and saber khachnaou , in an interview with french radio station rtl . it 's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces , or if it 's possible they 're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in isis ' audio statement . labidi was `` known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , '' essid said . but he added the man was n't known or being followed for anything special . the siege took place just days after a tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to abu bakr al-baghdadi , the leader of isis , was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group , which monitors terrorist propaganda . in his message , the jihadist claimed to belong to jund al-khilafah in tunisia , a group that in december pledged allegiance to isis , even though that vow had n't seemed to have fully registered with the islamist extremist group . his post comes after an isis fighter in the extremist group 's stronghold of raqqa in syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in tunisia had not pledged fealty . `` this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be isis ' debut on the tunisian stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from tunisian jihadis for maximum impact , '' cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said . the attack may have been in and about tunisia , but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners . they came from various backgrounds , from a spanish couple to a colombian mother and son . in addition to those pairs , the dead included three italians , three japanese , two french , two poles , a belgian , a russian and a briton , according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments . three tunisians , one of them a security officer and another a job applicant , also were killed , according to aidi . twelve of those killed had been aboard the msc splendida , a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in tunis hours before the bloodshed , its parent company said in a statement . five more victims came from a similar vessel , the costa fascinosa , which was at port in the tunisian capital at the same time , according to costa cruises . another 36 people remain hospitalized , while eight others were treated and released . the bardo had been a logical stop for these tourists , housed next to tunisia 's parliament in a 19th century palace and cast as a `` jewel of tunisian heritage , '' with its exhibits showcasing the country 's art , culture and history . its prominent place in tunisia 's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism , with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists . `` they hit the heart of our livelihood , '' said mohammed ali troudi , a taxi driver in tunis . it 's too early to tell how tourists will react to the attack . both the msc splendida and the costa fascinosa have since left tunis , even as the search continues for some of their missing passengers -- at least four from the splendida and two from the fascinosa , according to their respective companies . the question is whether more passenger-packed cruise ships , as well as commercial airliners filled with tourists , will come to tunisia in the future . travelers warned of risks as tunisia reels from attack . the economy and terrorism are linked in tunisia , in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home . attacking what tunisian lawmaker sabrine ghoubantini called `` a symbol of sovereignty in tunisia '' likely wo n't help . `` it 's really sad , '' ghoubantini told cnn from tunis , `` and i hope that it wo n't really affect our economy . '' the government has been battling a jihadist presence in the chaambi mountains . and in february , the country 's interior ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of isis leader al-baghdadi . mehrezia labidi , another parliamentarian , says it 's imperative that the message gets across to would-be jihadists that `` life in democracy is better than '' what terrorist recruiters are telling them . `` we have really to work on the culture , the level of ideas , '' she said . meanwhile , she and others stressed that the vast majority of tunisians -- including secular-minded citizens and moderate islamists -- need to come together for their country and against these extremist views and tactics . `` they are trying to terrify us . but the whole tunisian people is unified -- all the parties , all the civil society organizations , all the countries are unified , '' ghoubantini said . '' ... i 'm sure that we will fight terrorism and that we will really eradicate it from our country .

london -lrb- cnn -rrb- a supporter of suspended `` top gear '' host jeremy clarkson delivered a petition with nearly 1 million signatures calling for his reinstatement to the bbc 's headquarters in london on friday -- driving an armored tank up to the building . clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer , the bbc reported last week , and `` top gear '' -- a highly popular show with a big global audience -- was not broadcast as scheduled sunday . the bbc 's decision to take the show off the air pending an investigation has outraged many of clarkson 's die-hard fans . more than 990,000 of them have signed the petition posted on change.org by guido fawkes , a right-wing political blogger , just a week ago . whether the show of support will have any impact on the bbc 's response is unclear . clarkson tweeted his thanks friday night to those who are calling for his reinstatement , saying he is `` very touched . '' the findings of the internal investigation are due to be presented to the corporation 's director general next week , the bbc said thursday . `` once this has been considered , we will set out any further steps , '' a statement said . the bbc said in an earlier statement that clarkson , one of the corporation 's highest earners , had `` a fracas with a bbc producer . '' in an indication of its popularity , `` top gear '' was named as the world 's most widely watched factual program in the guinness world records 2013 edition book , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide . clarkson vented his apparent frustration in an expletive-filled speech thursday night in what seemed to be a spontaneous appearance at a charity auction in north london . a cnn reporter who was at the event heard clarkson swear liberally as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc `` have f ***** themselves '' and that it had ruined a great show . clarkson also auctioned what he said would be one final lap of the `` top gear '' track in surrey , outside london -- used in the show for putting vehicles through their paces -- for # 100,000 -lrb- $ 148,000 . -rrb- it 's not clear whether he had the authority to offer the use of the track for auction -- but his words seem to suggest he does n't expect his bbc career to continue , even if no decision is expected before next week . `` i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap , '' clarkson said . `` so i 'll go down to surrey , and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f ****** b ******* sack me . '' whoever placed the winning bid would be able to ride in a car with him on that lap , he said , or in a rare laferrari supercar owned by a friend . clarkson , who 's been presenting the show since the late 1980s , added , `` i 'll be a bit tearful when i do it . '' the controversial star has at least one influential ally -- uk prime minister david cameron . `` i do n't know exactly what happened , '' cameron told the bbc last week . `` he 's a constituent of mine , a friend of mine . he 's a huge talent . `` because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people , including my children , who 'd be heartbroken if ` top gear ' was taken off air , i hope this can be sorted out , because it 's a great program and he 's a great talent . '' opinion : why we crave the abuse of jeremy clarkson . it is not the first time that clarkson has been at the center of controversy . last may , the television star asked for forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show . clarkson had mumbled the n-word while reciting a children 's nursery rhyme , but that version of the take was never aired . last year , the bbc show hit the headlines when argentina complained about a `` top gear '' special filmed in the country in which the number plate h982 fkl was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 falklands war . forced to stop filming and leave the country , clarkson said on the bbc newsbeat website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental . in a previous article on its website , the bbc said `` jeremy clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion . '' journalist monica sarkar contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- lewis hamilton will begin sunday 's malaysian grand prix in pole position after dominating qualifying in torrential conditions . the mercedes driver , and current world champion , beat ferrari 's sebastian vettel into second place who himself snatched a front row berth away from countryman nico rosberg in the final seconds of qualifying . `` it was a fantastic job for the team to have us both up here again , '' hamilton said , referring to teammate rosberg 's third place finish . tension ? initially it had appeared that the tensions that had marked last season 's title race had re-emerged . hamilton aborted a flying lap after it looked like rosberg had blocked him . but both men played down the incident in the post-qualifying press conference . rosberg , for his part , was more annoyed that vettel had managed to steal second place at the death . `` i just did n't drive well enough , i 'm annoyed by that , '' rosberg said . `` third place is not good enough . '' deluge . qualifying took place amid spectacular thunderstorms which delayed qualifying by half an hour . indeed , malaysia has become known for such conditions . the 2012 race was halted for an hour and in 2009 abandoned altogether and awarded to jenson button after 31 laps . but hamilton made light work of the conditions , looked the quickest throughout and will try to build on his season opening win in australia . yet perhaps the most impressive performance of the day came further down the grid . toro rosso 's 17 year old driver max verstappen will start the race in sixth in only his second race for the team .

'' the release of the vine video , featuring the house mother of the campus ' sigma alpha epsilon chapter , could n't come at a worse time -- just days after video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song . but beauton gilbow , the fraternity 's house mother , insists she 's not racist . and two black alumni of the fraternity house agree with the woman they call `` mom b. '' `` i have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news , '' gilbow said in a statement . `` i am heartbroken by the portrayal that i am in some way racist . i have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life . the song in the background was the sound of `` all gold everything '' from trinidad james -- a black , atlanta-based rapper . `` i was singing along to a trinidad song , but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week . '' william bruce james ii , the most recent black member at the fraternity chapter , said no one should use the n-word in any context -- even if it 's just a song . `` that word needs to die , '' james told cnn tonight . `` with that being said , i do n't believe that mom b. has hatred in her heart . i was there with her for four years . she took great care of me ... she cared about me , she cares about my family . she had pictures of me , my wife , my children on the entryway table in that house . mom b means a lot to me .

sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- rebels seized an international airport in yemen sunday as a u.n. envoy warned that the country was at `` the edge of civil war . '' houthi militants took over the airport in taiz as they swept through the city and surrounding province , two officials with the taiz provincial government said . one civilian was killed and 82 others wounded when the rebels fired at local residents protesting their presence , the officials said . the rebels have also seized security and intelligence buildings in taiz and set up checkpoints in the area , the officials said . taiz , about 390 kilometers -lrb- 240 miles -rrb- south of sanaa , is yemen 's cultural capital . the rebels -- shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country -- surrounded the presidential palace in january . yemen 's president and his cabinet resigned days later . ousted president abdu rabu mansour hadi says his resignation was n't valid and maintains that he remains the country 's leader . in a statement sunday , the united nations security council backed hadi , calling for all sides to end armed hostilities and work out differences at the negotiating table . `` peaceful dialogue is the only way forward , '' said jamal benomar , the u.n. 's special adviser on yemen . but he gave a dire assessment of the current situation , saying the country is in a `` rapid downward spiral '' and at `` the edge of civil war . '' this is n't the first time the u.n. security council has weighed in on the mounting tensions . last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest . but so far , it seems calls for calm from around the world have done little to quell the violence . last week , a yemeni jet commanded by the houthi fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden . no one was injured , but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides . that same day , yemeni military forces -- some under the houthis , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes , aden gov. abdulaziz hobtour said . there are growing concerns that terror groups such as al qaeda in the arabian peninsula and isis could take advantage of the chaos to mount attacks and spread their reach . bombings at two mosques in sanaa last week killed at least 137 people and wounded hundreds more . isis claimed responsibility in a statement posted on a site that has published previous statements from the group . on saturday the state department said the u.s. military had pulled its remaining personnel out of yemen due to the deteriorating security situation . journalist hakim almasmari reported from sanaa , cnn 's catherine e. shoichet reported from atlanta and cnn 's richard roth reported from the united nations . cnn 's anas hamdan , greg botelho , hamdi alkhshali , ed payne and laura koran contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands of singaporeans gathered in pouring rain sunday to bid farewell to lee kuan yew , the southeast asian city-state 's founding prime minister who charted its spectacular economic rise . draped in the national flag , lee 's coffin was taken on a solemn procession through the sodden streets of the tropical city , where crowds of mourners defied the downpour to pay their last respects . the funeral service was attended by dozens of foreign dignitaries , including former u.s. president bill clinton and indian prime minister narendra modi . `` the light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished . we have lost our founding father mr. lee kuan yew , who lived and breathed singapore all his life , '' singaporean prime minister lee hsien loong , who is one of lee 's sons , said in a eulogy . lee died early monday morning at age 91 , prompting an outpouring of grief and tributes from around the world . he had been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia on february 5 . born in 1923 , lee co-founded singapore , a former british colony , in 1965 when it declared its independence from malaysia . he served as its prime minister for more than three decades , shaping the once poor trading post into a wealthy financial center . he continued to play an important role in government until his final years . after lee 's death , hundreds of thousands of people joined huge lines to pay respects to the former leader as his body lay in state at singapore 's parliament house for several days last week . the procession sunday weaved past a number of notable singapore landmarks on the way to the university cultural centre , where the state funeral service took place . `` together , we came not only to mourn . together , we celebrate mr. lee kuan yew 's long and full life , and what he has achieved with us , his people , '' his son said in his eulogy . lee was also honored by a 21-gun salute and a minute of silence , as well as displays by the singapore air force and the singapore navy . the funeral service was to be followed by a private cremation . other international figures attending the funeral included japanese prime minister shinzo abe , australian prime minister tony abbott , leader of the u.k. house of commons william hague and former u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger . although lee is admired for the economic success he helped singapore achieve , he also drew criticism for curbing media freedoms and the treatment of political opponents . `` while remembering his deeds that helped build singapore up to what it is today , the government should also mark the passing of lee kuan yew , by making a break from the politics of yesteryear that were too often marked by restrictions on basic civil and political rights , '' phil robertson , deputy director of human rights watch 's asia division , said in a statement sunday .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- manchester united and skipper wayne rooney significantly boosted its own chances and delivered a probable knockout blow to tottenham hotspur 's hopes of champions league qualification with 3-0 home win sunday . first half goals from marouane fellaini , michael carrick and rooney effectively ended the epl match as a contest , with the win leaving united in fourth spot , but only two points adrift of second-placed manchester city . tottenham is seventh , six points adrift of the top four . rooney 's third after another piece of disastrous defending from the visitors led to an impromptu and topical goal celebration , which was certainly the main talking point . a national newspaper had posted a video on on social media sunday which appeared to show rooney being felled by fellow epl footballer and former united teammate phil bardsley as both donned boxing gloves for a `` friendly '' fight in his kitchen . after he had converted following a mistake by nabil bentaleb , rooney threw a few mock punches then keeled over backwards on to the old trafford turf . tottenham 's players and fans were probably the only people not to see the funny side , but the joke was on them , having gone into the match seeking a third straight away win at united and five games unbeaten against the red devils . from united first significant attack on nine minutes , an unmarked fellaini was found by carrick and the belgian international beat hugo lloris with a low shot . fellaini caused chaos in the tottenham defense for the second with carrick left free to head home from distance . rooney 's emphatic strike after bentaleb gifted him possession , proved the icing on the cake . the victory eases the pressure on manager louis van gaal and his expensively assembled side after some lackluster recent performances and last monday 's disappointing fa cup exit to arsenal . it meant tottenham , off the back of two straight wins and with harry kane in top form , was favored going into the crucial match , but the young striker barely had a glimpse of goal , until having his side 's first shot on target after fully 88 minutes as united dominated . earlier , chelsea extended its lead at the top of the epl to six points but was held 1-1 at home to southampton in another less than convincing performance from jose mourinho 's team . off the back of a disappointing champions league exit to paris saint germain , chelsea again struggled to find its best form at stamford bridge despite going in front from diego costa 's 18th league goal . dusan tasic equalized from the spot for the saints after nemanja matic was adjudged to have fouled sadio mane , with chelsea protests waved away . chelsea found fraser forster hard to beat and the visiting goalkeeper made fine saves from oscar , eden hazard and juan cuadrado to deny the leaders three points . however , it has a commanding lead plus a game in hand over chasing manchester city , which lost 1-0 to burnley saturday , in a severe blow to hopes of retaining the title . in sunday 's other epl clash , everton eased its relegation fears with a 3-0 win over newcastle , who had fabricio coloccini sent off for a foul on aaron lennon , who is on loan at goodison from tottenham . in la liga , gareth bale snapped a recent lean spell of scoring form with both goals as real madrid beat levante 2-0 in the bernabeu . the record signing struck first in the 17th minute when cristiano ronaldo 's acrobatic effort was cleared off the line and the welshman scored the rebound . the same combination was at work for the second in the 40th minute with ronaldo 's strike helped into the visiting net by bale . ronaldo might have added to the tally and missed several opportunities but real was never threatened by levante and eased to the three points . it leaves them a point adrift of barcelona ahead of next weekend 's el clasico , which could go a long way to determining the title race .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- marine biologists at the south carolina aquarium are treating a rare , 475-pound leatherback sea turtle that washed up saturday on a nearby beach . the episode marks the first rescue of a leatherback sea turtle in south carolina and is believed to be only the fifth live rescue of this species in the united states , according to the south carolina department of natural resources . the endangered turtle was found stranded on the yawkey-south island preserve , a wildlife refuge near georgetown , south carolina . rescuers named it yawkey . because the turtle is believed to be a juvenile -- rescuers say it 's probably less than 10 years old -- and has not reached sexual maturity , biologists ca n't yet determine its sex . rescuers found no external signs of trauma to the reptile , although it was hypoglycemic . staffers with the aquarium 's sea turtle rescue program gave it antibiotics , vitamins and some time to recover at their facilities . the treatments appear to be helping . aquarium officials said the turtle was more energetic tuesday than when it was first admitted . even so , leatherback turtles historically do n't do well in captivity . for that reason , aquarium staffers are working with the state 's department of natural resources to determine the best place and time to release the turtle back into the ocean -- most likely within the next few days . leatherbacks are the largest turtles on earth and can grow up to 2,000 pounds . they are found throughout the world 's oceans and have been spotted as far north as norway and as far south as south america .
los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- three area residents were arrested and charged wednesday for allegedly operating four southern california schools for korean and chinese students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a `` pay-to-stay '' scheme . the three educators collected as much as $ 6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from south korea and china , said federal prosecutors . the arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud , money laundering and other immigration offenses . an allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme , authorities said . hee sun shim , 51 , of beverly hills , is the owner and manager and of the postsecondary schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud , authorities said . the two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense : they are hyung chan moon , also known as steve moon , 39 , of los angeles who assisted in the operation and management of the schools ; and eun young choi , also known as jamie choi , 32 , of los angeles , a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school . shim , who also went by leonard shim and leo shim , is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence , as well as two counts of money laundering , prosecutors said . the three defendants and their attorneys could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday . `` immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules , '' acting u.s. attorney stephanie yonekura said in a statement . `` in this case , officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country . this type of fraud against the united states will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system , '' the federal prosecutor said . three of the schools are in los angeles ' koreatown neighborhood : prodee university/neo-america language school ; walter jay m.d. institute , an educational center -lrb- wjmd -rrb- ; and the american college of forensic studies -lrb- acfs -rrb- , authorities said . the fourth school is currently operating in alhambra , california : likie fashion and technology college , authorities said . `` what we 've broken up is a pay-to-stay scheme , '' said claude arnold , special agent in charge of the los angeles office of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement . `` that 's a scheme where institutions purport to be schools , but are really not doing any education whatsoever , '' he said . `` any scheme where someone gains access to the u.s. through fraud is also a national security vulnerability , '' arnold said . `` although we do n't have any information that any of these people wish to do harm to the u.s. , the point is anyone could take advantage of a vulnerability like this . which is why it is so important that we identify these vulnerabilities and shut them down . '' prodee university/neo-america language school was located on the fifth floor of a los angeles office tower near the koreatown neighborhood , but homeland security investigations agents said they found the school `` abandoned '' during their raid on wednesday . the agents allowed cnn to attend the raid . the school featured classrooms , administrative offices and a small library , but no one occupied the spaces . in fact , the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set , filled with props and decorations , but no actors . in one small room , a cd player serenaded empty desks with classical music . the tiny library featured usc and ucla pennants . the television was n't even plugged in . one federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older , in their 30s , 40s and 50s . prodee 's 2011-2012 catalog describes the facility as an english as second language school and states `` it is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand english in all facets of life by providing a top quality esl educational environment , '' according to a copy of the document on the website of the california bureau for private postsecondary education . `` our enthusiastic and qualified instructors concern themselves with teaching a rigorous , but innovative curriculum of interactive and beneficial courses and materials leading to higher toefl scores and admission to u.s. colleges and universities , '' the catalog says . another document with the state bureau indicates prodee had a 73 % graduation rate in 2011 and a 60 % rate in 2010 . but the indictment alleges that students actually lived nevada , texas , washington state and arizona . the schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the united states , authorities said . the document , called a form i-20 , made a student eligible for a f-1 student visa . in exchange for that form , students paid $ 1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months , authorities said . during their investigation , authorities interviewed 35 students , mainly from south korea , and found none resided in los angeles , officials said . an unannounced federal inspection of prodee 's main site in 2011 found only one english class with three students , though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites , prosecutors said . on the same day , federal authorities also visited the american college of forensic studies found only one religion with one student , though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students , prosecutors said . some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other u.s. schools also participating in the federal student and exchange visitor program , prosecutors said . the conspiracy count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years . the immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison , and the money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years , authorities said . wednesday 's arrests follow last week 's federal raids of more than three dozen `` maternity hotels '' in southern california where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a u.s.-citizen baby , authorities said . the `` maternity tourism '' sites included apartment complexes in los angeles , orange and san bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said . those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from china , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement . those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said . specifically , authorities in the maternity tourism raids obtained search warrants for 37 location and conducted searches at more than 50 locations , including sites that consented to a federal search , said virginia kice , a spokeswoman for u.s. immigration and customs enforcement .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy . the revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account , and that she had a private computer server in her new york home , sent shock waves through the world of politics last week . questions arose about whether clinton conducted her official business on private email , possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public . republicans jumped on the story . `` it makes you wonder , '' said reince preibus , the chairman of the republican national committee . `` did she use the private emails so she could conduct diplomacy and fund-raising at the same time ? '' even many democrats are worried about the implications of this recent story . their front-runner , their `` inevitable '' nominee for 2016 , now seems vulnerable . many in washington are anticipating that the scandal is only getting started . this is not the first time that hillary clinton has found herself in this situation . she has spent much of her political career battling scandals . when her husband , bill clinton , was president of the united states , she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- `` travel-gate , '' `` file-gate '' and the whitewater affair . she stood by her husband 's side later in his presidency when house republicans moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with monica lewinsky , a white house intern . although clinton enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the senate , the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under president obama . during her tenure , republicans became consumed with multiple investigations into her role in the tragic benghazi attacks . although the investigations failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing , the issue became a rallying point for conservative activists and fund-raisers . some republicans now claim that the emails will provide the data that they have been looking for to prove what they were saying . but those observers who are predicting her demise should remember that hillary clinton has proven to be remarkably resilient over the years . each time she or her family has been hit with a scandal , she has survived . she has proven to be an extraordinarily tough fighter who turns these challenges into opportunities to become stronger . as kate mckinnon , playing hillary clinton on `` saturday night live '' said , `` nice try . ... this is not how hillary clinton goes down . '' based on her history , what can we expect from the clinton scandal playbook ? attack the accuser and the investigative process : nobody has done this better than hillary clinton . when her husband first confronted charges about his affair , clinton famously went on television and spoke about a `` right-wing conspiracy '' that she claimed was driving the scandal . although the revelation that the affair did occur brought her family great embarrassment , her charge became part of a larger counterattack from the administration that proved to be extremely effective . the clintons zeroed in on the hyperpartisanship of some members of the gop , such as house speaker newt gingrich , claiming that the republicans in congress were on a mission to pull off a political coup . she employed a similar strategy with the benghazi investigations , arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation . we are likely to hear similar arguments now , particularly since the email controversy has opened up right as the campaign season is taking off . as more republicans ca n't resist jumping on the issue , clinton will push back , focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down . stick it out : one thing that hillary clinton and her husband understand well is that the news media love a good scandal feeding frenzy , but that soon enough reporters move on . the american public , which is now used to fast-paced and constantly changing news stories , will follow the coverage as it shifts to a new story even after weeks , or months , of attention on one single issue . remember the ebola crisis ? not many people do , though for a time it was all anyone was talking about . as brendan nyhan wrote in the new york times : `` if there 's one thing we 've learned from past presidential campaigns , it 's that most supposed game-changers like this quickly fade from the memory of the political class , having never been noticed by most americans in the first place . '' when dealing with scandal , hillary clinton and her husband have avoided taking any rash action , ignoring whispers about resignation or discussions about major apologies . instead they strike back against their opponents and wait out the news cycle until the frenzy dies down . people should not expect clinton to do anything drastic in the near future . her first move , via twitter , was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the state department to review and release some of the email as soon as possible . while some democrats are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party -lrb- elizabeth warren ! -rrb- into the political fray , clinton is not going to give them any space to do this . she will wait until reporters and congress move in a different direction . rally the party base : if there is one thing that the clintons understand , it is that their party is desperate for a good fight . after years of dealing with congressional republicans and the hardball tactics of conservative activists , the clintons appreciate that members of their party are searching for leaders who will take on their opponents . democrats are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by republicans . this has been one of the major complaints from democrats about obama . even when many democrats were furious with the white house following the monica lewinsky revelation , the clintons appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the gop . by 1998 , they had transformed the issue from being about clinton and perjury to a struggle to protect the democratic party . clinton will do this again . democrats are feeling particularly vulnerable ever since former florida gov. jeb bush entered the race , bringing star power to a gop campaign that seemed filled with lightweights and flawed candidates . given that democrats feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the white house so that the next president can protect obama 's programs from republican attack , clinton will appeal to that instinct to carry her through . will it work ? that remains to be seen . it will depend on the scale and scope of the upcoming revelations and what her opponents decide to do with the material . but the clinton playbook is pretty clear and road-tested . if clinton 's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over , they really have n't been studying their history .

lausanne , switzerland -lrb- cnn -rrb- nuclear talks intensified sunday between world powers and iran , but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb tehran 's nuclear program ahead of a tuesday deadline . as the negotiations entered their fourth day , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than israel 's deepest fears . the talks had hit a snag on saturday , with diplomats describing iran as refusing to budge , but as the french , german and chinese foreign ministers arrived , the mood seemed more optimistic . the british and russian foreign ministers were expected late sunday . u.s. officials and western diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense , which was expected as the talks reached the endgame . they said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer , but they were unsure it could be reached . two core issues are still unresolved : 1 -rrb- limits on iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal ; and 2 -rrb- the pace of lifting united nations sanctions . the u.s. officials stressed all of the elements were interrelated and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to , comparing the final deal to a puzzle . but they indicated most of the other elements were solvable if those two major hurdles could be overcome . the speed of which u.n. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute . iran wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect . while diplomats say iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , sanctions adopted by the united nations are more complicated . many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the u.n. nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , that iran 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension . on saturday , iranian foreign minister mohammad zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block , saying he believes the world powers `` have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together . it 's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating . '' u.s. officials said that all sides , including iran , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as iran confirms its compliance to the deal . but they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula . iran also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect . those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines . u.s. and european officials worry that could enable iran to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon . diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions , with others being relaxed over the next five . `` we will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed , '' a western diplomat said . `` we are not asking them to do nothing , but they want to do more than we want them to do '' referring to how much research the iranians want to be able to still undertake . but the diplomat added , `` after 15 years , they can do what they want . '' a senior iranian diplomat told cnn on sunday : `` it 's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as iranian resistance on those issues . it can also be characterized as the other side 's intransigence in the talks . '' diplomats said iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium , a process that can lead to weapons-grade material . the figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on thursday , but substantially more than the several hundred the united states had originally wanted . iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges , but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile . u.s. officials maintain the number is abstract , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges iran can operate , which they believe will extend the time iran would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the `` break-out time '' -- to at least a year . on monday , a senior state department official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of fissile material . there had been word previously that iran might export it to russia , but an iranian negotiator , abbas araqchi , told journalists sunday that iran had not agreed to it . `` the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to them abroad . ... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , '' he said . netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal . after meeting with visiting senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , a republican , netanyahu said , `` this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse . '' `` in parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement , the proxies of iran in the middle east are carrying out a wide occupation of yemen , '' he said . `` the iran-lausanne-yemen axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped . '' the parties are seeking agreement on the basic parameters of a deal before march 31 . a comprehensive deal including technical annexes is supposed to be concluded by june 30 . tuesday is seen as a critical milestone to the u.s. negotiators , who are trying to thwart a threat from congress to impose additional sanctions without the framework . that could prompt iran to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether . but even if a pact is reached , it is unclear what form it would take . u.s. officials say they will need to publicize something that quantifies iran 's commitments before submitting it to congress . but u.s. and western diplomats say that iran is looking simply for an `` understanding '' of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached . cnn 's jim sciutto contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- iraqi forces say they 've captured key areas in their offensive to take back tikrit , which has been under isis control since june . the security forces , backed by shia militias , raised the iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city monday night , a security official with the forces in tikrit told cnn . the gains , according to the official , came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city 's streets . at least 26 militants were killed in the operation , the official said . earlier monday , iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern tikrit . the renewed push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s.-led airstrikes aimed at isis targets around the city . the goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for iraqi forces to go in . now security forces and fighters from hashd al-shaabi , a predominantly shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit back from isis , say they 're gaining ground . iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis , which calls itself the islamic state , conquered the city in june as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate . and each time , so far , they 've failed . the latest push began after iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi on march 1 ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salahuddin province . militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein and located about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- north of baghdad . isis responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city , hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure , said saad al-hadithi , a spokesman for al-abadi . this movement led iraq 's military to pause its operation , out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy iraqi military and some civilian casualties . the situation spurred the iraqi prime minister to request help from the u.s.-led coalition , which conducted airstrikes around tikrit last week . cnn 's jomana karadsheh , catherine e. shoichet , ashley fantz , ben wedeman and greg botelho contributed to this report .

-lrb- the hollywood reporter -rrb- good artists borrow . great artists steal . on tuesday , a california federal jury delivered its own message to artists everywhere that inspiration can rise to copyright infringement . the verdict was reached after eight days of trial testimony examining whether robin thicke 's and pharrell williams ' `` blurred lines , '' one of the most successful songs of the young century , was improperly drawn from a soulful hallmark from the prior one -- marvin gaye 's 1977 hit `` got to give it up . '' ultimately , a jury comprised of five women and three men heard dueling opinions regarding `` blurred lines '' and decided to order thicke and williams to pay $ 4 million in copyright damages plus profits attributable to infringement , which for thicke was determined to be $ 1.8 million and for williams was determined to be $ 1.6 million . both escaped statutory damages as the infringement was found not to be willful . read more : robin thicke sues to protect ` blurred lines ' from marvin gaye 's family -lrb- exclusive -rrb- . the hardly predictable outcome over a song that made more than $ 16 million in profits will resonate in the music industry where copyright lawsuits are commonplace , but few such suits ever make it to trial . most never get past the summary judgment phase because judges carefully draw the line on any lawsuits alleging misappropriation of non-protectable ideas . the highest profile disputes like the one between tom petty and sam smith over `` stay with me '' usually settle . not only did the `` blurred lines '' case go the distance , both sides brought esteemed entertainment litigators to convince the jury . howard king , representing thicke , williams and rapper t.i -lrb- a.k.a. clifford harris jr. -rrb- , spoke how artists need wide berth in their creative pursuits . during opening arguments , he told the jury , `` we 're going to show you what you already know : that no one owns a genre or a style or a groove . to be inspired by marvin gaye is an honorable thing . '' over the next week-and-a-half , king would execute a two-pronged strategy : first , he emphasized that frankie and nona gaye only owned compositional elements in the `` got to give it up '' sheet music , leaving out more recognizable elements of the recording like the percussion and singing . second , he had witnesses testifying both to the differences of `` blurred lines '' and `` got to give it up '' as well as the similarities in other famous songs . the case has been tough on thicke thanks to depositions revealing he lied in media interviews and was drunk and high on vicodin . but the singer attempted to do himself a favor by showcasing that songs can be stitched together with ease and that perceptions about similarity can be deceiving . on the witness stand , he sang a medley of u2 's `` with or without you , '' the beatles ' `` let it be , '' alphaville 's `` forever young , '' bob marley 's `` no woman no cry '' and michael jackson 's `` man in the mirror . '' read more : robin thicke admits drug abuse , lying to media in wild `` blurred lines '' deposition -lrb- exclusive -rrb- . williams also testified about his song creation process , admitting to jurors that `` blurred lines '' channels `` that '70s feeling '' and that he looked up to gaye , but that to feel , is n't copyright infringement . `` the last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else 's when you love him , '' said williams , expressing a point-of-view that 's in contrast to the maxim that good artists borrow and great artists steal . richard busch , attorney for the gayes , appeared to know he 'd need to overcome the celebrity charisma of his counterparts . `` they will smile at you and they will be charming , '' he said in opening arguments . `` keep one thing in mind : they are professional performers . '' read more : ` blurred lines ' trial -- robin thicke performs piano medley in court . the gaye family was handicapped by u.s. district judge john kronstadt 's decision to preclude use at trial of the original sound recording of `` got to give it up '' because gaye 's copyrights on the song were limited to the sheet music compositions . before the trial began , busch wondered whether his side would get a fair trial , and while the judge eventually allowed a stripped-down version of gaye 's song to be played for the jury 's ears , the attorney was disturbed by comments made by the thicke side that he argued had `` poisoned '' the trial . the judge dismissed those concerns . any lingering unhappiness over the judge 's decision leading to the jury 's verdict will likely be taken on appeal . to demonstrate copyright infringement , busch instead leaned on the musicologists , who testified of similarities in signature phrase , hook , keyboard-bass interplay , lyrics and theme of the songs . although `` blurred lines '' was the headliner , the gaye family also attempted to prove that thicke 's `` love after war '' was an infringement of gaye 's `` after the dance '' too . then , there was the rare peek at `` blurred lines '' financial success as the gaye family made their case for damages . busch had accounting experts speak about all the money made -- including $ 5.6 million in profits to thicke , $ 5.2 million to williams and $ 700k to t.i. and the rest of the $ 16.7 million in overall profits to record companies interscope , umg distribution and star trak . the gayes also wanted some of the $ 11 million in touring income attributable to `` blurred lines '' success as well as money for overhead costs and statutory damages for willful infringement . all told , the gaye family was seeking more than $ 25 million -- a mammoth demand that would shatter the song plagiarism high-water mark of $ 5.4 million that a california court ordered michael bolton and sony to pay two decades ago for infringing the isley brothers ' `` love is a wonderful thing . '' in closing arguments , busch raised the issue of thicke 's credibility , telling jurors , '' `` what it boils down to is ` yes , we copied . yes , we took it . yes , we lied about it . yes , we changed our story every time ' ... it boils down to this : who do you believe ? ... are you going to believe robin thicke , who told us all he 's not an honest person ? '' king offered a rebuttal . `` why would mr. williams need to copy anyone to create a hit ? '' he asked the jury . `` why would mr. thicke and mr. williams endure a proceeding like this , where their personal financial details are revealed to the world ? '' in what might now be the landmark legal controversy over songcraft , the jury decided to find that thicke and williams infringed both songs . the two were only punished $ 9,375 for `` love after war , '' but it will be the multimillion dollar verdict regarding `` blurred lines '' that will sound out for ages . © 2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .

lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a unique world where friendships are forged , deals struck and more than the occasional argument breaks out . welcome to nigeria 's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day . they are called `` free '' because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading . discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president . newspaper vendor john mgbachi , a former shoemaker from eastern nigeria , who has a stand in tinubu square on lagos island said that far from being bad for business , he welcomes the free readers . `` they are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me , '' he said . mgbachi told cnn that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments , mostly the premier league , and also during the election campaign period . to avoid losing out on sales too much , mgbachi has developed an interesting business model : `` i decided not to make -lrb- reading -rrb- completely free . for some of the dailies , its 20 naira , -lrb- 10 cents -rrb- 30 naira -lrb- 15 cents -rrb- for the sports papers and 50 naira -lrb- 30 cents -rrb- for the magazines . `` it 's not really a static price , it depends on the bargaining power of the person , '' he added . some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers . the free readers come from all walks of life and cnn spoke to analysts , an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited . they talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper . one told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer . mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet . he added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many nigerians can not afford to buy newspapers . most of nigeria 's $ 70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard germanwings flight 9525 , the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot andreas lubitz purposely crashing the plane into the french alps , killing all 150 people on board . i happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy : a recent graduate of drexel university -- where i teach -- and her mother were on the ill-fated flight , i lived in germany for 18 years and i am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness . while the engineering of the airbus aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing , what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine . when complex engineering systems interact with human factors , it is most often the human that causes the anomaly . humans are far less reliable than machines . the average aviator has superior intellectual and cognitive abilities , and is psychologically stable and reliable . while it is not surprising that when it comes to aviation accidents , the first line of inquiry is into what went wrong with the plane . however , very often , as apparently is the case here , something went wrong with the human flying the plane . pilots are typically tested for emotional stability and screened for the presence of mental illness when they are selected . the u.s. navy has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers . but we have learned that the german company lufthansa and its budget airline affiliate germanwings do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process . psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in germany as it is in the united states . perhaps it should be . a fitness-for-duty evaluation asks this important question : can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint ? the deliberate destruction of flight 9525 by a single person , most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave , can also be considered an act of terrorism . the action constitutes the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective . research on the perpetrators of terrorism has revealed that a single person is capable of executing odd , unexplainable violent actions . their behaviors may be related to a political or social framework , or it may be associated with something deeply personal . examples include richard reid , the failed shoe bomber ; eric rudolph , the olympic bomber ; or theodore kaczynski , the unabomber . in 2009 , maj. nidal malik hasan , a u.s. army officer and psychiatrist , went on a shooting spree at fort hood , texas , killing 13 and wounding 32 . and in 2012 , staff sgt. robert bales , a 38-year-old father of two , opened fire and killed 16 innocent afghan civilians . when examining germanwings flight 9525 from the `` cockpit of the human mind , '' one must ask this question : how can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being ? as a psychologist , i would , of course , advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots , as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this . just as aircraft are inspected and maintained , it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane . but , just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error , with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft , there will always be an element of unpredictability present . and , unless we had a `` flight recorder '' for the human brain , we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot andreas lubitz . one thing is for sure : the tragic events of flight 9525 will surely renew conversation about what happened to flight mh370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since amelia earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance .

'' yells his grandmother . `` i have such a headache raising this child , '' 72-year-old old tang xinying confides . lu 's mother abandoned him after he was born and his father works as a carpenter in shandong province hundreds of miles further north . he comes back perhaps once a year . in china , lu is what 's called a `` left-behind child . '' conservatively , there are at least 61 million such children in china -- that 's a staggering one in five . they struggle at school , have higher rates of mental health issues , and suffer from more behavioral problems than their contemporaries . `` i tell him ` your father is working and your mother does n't want you , ' '' says an exasperated tang . in chao hu , a village in the inland province of anhui , a dead-end track passes by half-finished housing projects and abandoned fields . a yellow haze hangs in the air leaving a metallic taste in the mouth . china 's industrial pollution made it out here , but the jobs have n't . everyone of working age in chao hu has gone to the cities to find work , leaving the old and very young behind . lu holds my hand as we walk through the tiny village . a group of old women sit on three-legged wooden stools listening to chinese opera on a small radio . another walks by knitting . some old men make bootleg liquor in an oil drum . `` we do n't have fields that we can farm , if you do n't go out to work , then how do you earn an income ? '' says tang . `` their parents have to work outside of town and they can not bring their children with them . '' the all china women 's federation , a state - backed organization , paints a bleak picture for left behind children . a steady stream of state media reports highlights the abuse suffered by left behind children . and crimes are often blamed on them . `` it has a huge impact on society and the generation of people who grow up without parents , '' says ines kaempfer , of the center for child-rights and corporate social responsibility . `` there is a generation of chinese society that lacks security and trust . it could have a potentially disastrous effect . '' unintended consequences of mass urbanization and migration are not unique to china . but draconian rules have made the problem worse . china 's much-hated hukou system registers families as either rural or urban . most migrants ca n't change their household registration when they move . they struggle to access healthcare and other social services in urban areas . their children ca n't go to public schools -- even if they are born in the cities . critics say the hukou system has created a vast underclass of cheap labor to help drive china 's manufacturing revolution . recognizing some of its failures , the chinese communist party has proposed reforms of the hukou system including doing away with temporary residence permits . the topic is under discussion this week at the annual meeting of china 's national people 's congress , the country 's rubber-stamp parliament . `` though it is better than before , the hukou system is a huge problem , '' says professor fan bin , of the huadong technology institute . `` migrants ca n't afford to keep their children in big cities , the rent is high and the wages are low , and they ca n't pay the tuition for private schools .

beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- five years ago , beijinger robert zhao went on a trip to tibet . what he encountered left him confused but intrigued . a science graduate from china 's elite tsinghua university , he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion , but in the culture and devotion of the buddhists he met he found something worth knowing . now 25 , he is considering giving up his job and becoming a monk . `` it means i will have to give up everything of the ordinary world , '' he told cnn . while buddhism has a long history in china , entering via missionaries from india during the han dynasty , it was repressed during the maoist era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the cultural revolution and monks actively punished for believing in `` superstition . '' but now , a growing number of chinese are rediscovering the country 's dormant buddhist traditions . some , like zhao , are looking for a spiritual anchor in a competitive , fast-changing society . others take comfort in meditation and enjoy volunteering . however , it 's not always easy to combine buddhist beliefs with the demands of modern life . zhao works as an assistant to the boss of an environmental company . his religion means it 's difficult to entertain clients and partners -- a key part of the role . `` not drinking , smoking or eating meat affects my socializing . so the company has to send someone else to go with me , which creates extra expenses , '' he says . zhao has not told his family about his desire to become a monk yet , fearing that they might oppose it . fenggang yang , the director of the center on religion and chinese society at purdue university , indiana , says it 's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to buddhism . some discover it at university , where buddhist groups are active and famous monks and lamas give lectures . others have devout parents and grandparents . he also says that the chinese communist party policy has `` moved toward treating buddhism more favorably than other religions . '' christianity has also been growing in popularity in recent decades but church leaders say there has been a crackdown on christians , with authorities demolishing churches and removing crosses from skylines . in particular , it 's the tibetan strain of buddhism , rather than the chan -lrb- also called zen -rrb- tradition once popular in china , that is attracting new converts , particularly students , young professionals and businesspeople , he says . `` it appears that both the chanting and the physical , spiritual practices of tibetan buddhism are appealing to some people , '' yang added . to what extent these new converts are committed to buddhism as a religion , with its strictures and rituals , is an open question . a former leader of a university buddhism group , who did n't want to give his name , told cnn he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice . activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined buddhist scriptures , he added . yang at purdue university says that for most people in china , buddhism is treated more as culture than a religion . they may visit temples or read buddhist books , but few people treat it as a religion that requires serious commitment . `` indeed , people who identify as buddhists do a lot of non-buddhist spiritual things , such as believing in feng shui , consulting fortune-tellers , practicing qi gong and sampling books and practices of other religions , '' he says . on a recent weekend , more than four hundred people attended the annual gathering of beijing ren ai foundation , a buddhist charitable organization , at longquan monastery on the mountainous outskirts of the capital . zhong ying , the group 's 32-year-old deputy secretary general , said the group 's most active volunteers were between 20 and 35 years old . in the past five years their numbers had doubled to 200 . for attendee geng hui'er , a 26-year-old who works and lives in beijing , buddhism was something she rediscovered after returning from studying abroad in england . growing up , her family had raised her buddhist although she says she never really `` felt it . '' she now regularly attends meditation activities in monasteries or study groups organized by volunteers . geng says buddhism has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties . it 's also helped her establish a network of people she can talk to and socialize with . `` we sit together , sharing things that have happened in our lives and how we dealt with them , which is more helpful than reading books '' , she says . for zhao , the aspiring monk , buddhism has been a balm while dealing with poor health , as well as work and relationship problems . `` my life has been tough for years . -lrb- buddhism -rrb- keeps me away from the negative thoughts , like a reminder that 's always there , which has helped me a lot .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- india 's highest court has reversed a controversial law that gave the authorities sweeping powers to arrest and potentially jail people for comments posted on social networks and other internet platforms . the supreme court ruled that section 66a of the 2008 information technology act was `` unconstitutional '' and `` hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression , the two cardinal pillars of democracy . '' under section 66a , alleged offenders could face up to three years in jail for posting material that is `` grossly offensive , '' has `` menacing character , '' -- or perhaps even more ambiguously -- causes `` annoyance or inconvenience . '' the court said this wording was `` vague '' and could be `` misconstrued , '' according to ranjeeta rohatgi , an advocate who was present at the hearing in delhi tuesday . india 's cyber laws have ignited a furious debate about curbs on freedom of speech in recent years . in 2012 , a university professor was arrested for circulating a cartoon that poked fun at west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee . the cartoon , which was a parody of a scene in a popular indian movie , went viral on social media . he was charged with a range of offenses including defamation , insulting a woman and sending offensive messages from a computer . mahapatra called the charges a misuse of the law `` in the name of surveillance , to curb democratic rights , freedom of speech and human rights of common people . '' a year earlier , delhi went one step further with its digital crackdown when the so-called `` intermediary guidelines '' implicated web platforms themselves . the rules now require internet companies to take down any content seen as `` disparaging , '' `` blasphemous , '' or `` defamatory '' within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal . in mumbai , india 's financial center , police spokesman dhananjay kulkarni told cnn in february that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations . google says in the last half of 2013 it removed 540 items from its pages in compliance with orders issued by indian courts , government agencies , and law enforcement . it 's a similar story with facebook . the social networking site took down nearly 5,000 pieces of content reported by the indian government in the first half of 2014 . cnn 's harmeet shah singh and kunal sehgal in delhi , as well as mackenzie sigalos in hong kong contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the first official visit of afghan president ashraf ghani to washington comes as excitement mounts over the possibility that direct peace negotiations between the afghan government and the taliban are imminent . the visit , which began sunday , offers the opportunity for discussion and progress on a number of fronts , the coming face-to-face talks with the taliban almost certainly among them . but while the start of such talks would certainly be a positive development , it would hardly be a sign that peace is about to descend upon a land ravaged by decades of war . the reality is that an agreement with the taliban that is good for the afghan government is probably impossible right now . negotiations to end the taliban insurgency face a series of significant challenges , and an imperfect deal could harm afghanistan 's nascent unity government , encourage the formation of splinter groups of hardened fighters , boost existing terrorist groups like al qaeda and isis and plunge the country into an era of renewed violence and instability . that said , the united states should remain broadly supportive of these talks by promoting conditions that could make the possibility of success more likely down the road -- history has shown that successful negotiations most often occur when each party has some vulnerability to the other . militarily , the taliban is not the afghan government 's equal , but that does not mean the insurgents lack a strong negotiating position . for a start , the international presence in afghanistan is declining , freeing the taliban to operate more openly in the rural corners of the country . meanwhile , afghan security forces are being killed at rates that are probably not sustainable and civilian casualties are at an all-time high . most troublingly , the new national unity government has yet to clearly demonstrate its ability to govern . all this means that until the new government shows that the diverse interests within it can coexist , and it articulates a cohesive strategy to counter the taliban , the insurgents can make a strong case for postponing peace in the hopes of a better situation in the future . a second key to negotiating a path toward peace in afghanistan is devising a strategy to contain splinter groups . often in the course of negotiations , those unsatisfied with the peace process flock to new organizations to continue the fight . these can include so-called `` bitter enders , '' hardened fighters who want no part of peace . the emergence of splinter groups is an expected part of any peace negotiation process , but it must be minimized for an agreement to take hold . in the case of afghanistan , there is no shortage of groups willing to absorb fighters , from outlaw bandit groups to al qaeda . recently , as ghani has highlighted , there have even been stories of fighters declaring allegiance to terrorist group isis . it goes without saying that the spread of isis 's particularly violent form of extremism within afghanistan would make an already complex and precarious security situation all the more so . finally , negotiations must happen at a time when a peace agreement can reasonably be enforced -- it is one thing to craft a compromise and quite another to carry it out . too often in peace negotiations , an agreement is viewed as a finish line , but any deal can easily be derailed by unpopular political accommodations , economic incentives and rebel fighters who refuse to drop their arms . to take hold , peace agreements require a legitimate and effective government capable of communicating new realities to the public and executing policies that are often untried and complex . at the moment , the afghan government is struggling to carry out existing policies , while juggling the country 's many divergent interests . while a peace agreement would certainly boost the legitimacy of a national unity government , a stillborn accord would only lead to disillusionment and doubt . ultimately , the chances that talks between the afghan government and the taliban will succeed are remote at best . yet the united states should do everything it can to help create the underlying conditions to support productive negotiations -- if not now , at some point in the future . what can the u.s. do ? two things : . first , the obama administration could agree to the afghan government 's request to slow american troop withdrawals . this would allow the united states to assist the afghan government to stabilize the country and contain any splintering anti-government factions . second , the u.s. could remain actively engaged in promoting the success of the afghan national unity government . this means not merely maintaining existing development and economic efforts , but finding opportunities to assist the new government to boost its legitimacy . for example , the united states could support emerging efforts to build a meaningful relationship between afghanistan and its neighbor pakistan , which would increase public confidence in the government 's ability to protect its people . it also could lend a hand advising political leaders , including the many first-time cabinet officials , on governance and public service . sowing the seeds of future success in bringing peace to afghanistan requires no new u.s. boots on the ground or extravagant financial commitments . rather , it takes a willingness to continue to engage with afghanistan 's dynamic set of political challenges in small , but meaningful ways .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a nuclear deal with international powers on iran 's nuclear program is within reach and achievable , iranian president hassan rouhani told reporters saturday . rouhani said negotiators from both sides have found new common ground in recent days , the official islamic republic news agency reported . the president believes that `` clinching a general deal is easy , '' according to the irna story , but hammering out agreements on certain details `` will be a very tough and complicated job . '' iran has been largely isolated for years for its nuclear program , one that its leaders say the country wants for peaceful purposes . others , like the united states , have challenged that assertion and instituted strict sanctions , fearing that tehran actually plans to develop nuclear weapons . after years of basic stalemates , iranian officials and representatives of the p5 +1 have managed to reach short-term agreements as they try to strike a larger deal . the sides have been working toward that end in lausanne , switzerland , hoping to get a framework pact in place ahead of a march 31 deadline . u.s. secretary of state john kerry and iranian foreign minister javad zarif , joined these talks monday . all sides took a break friday , but are expected to return to the negotiating table soon . kerry , addressing reporters saturday in lausanne before leaving for london , said `` substantial progress '' had been made toward reaching a deal but that `` important gaps remain . '' he insisted that the international powers involved in the talks , the p5 +1 -- consisting of germany and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council : the united states , russia , china , france and britain -- were united in their determination to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is purely peaceful . the stakes are high and the issues complicated , kerry said . `` let me once again be clear : we do n't want just any deal , '' he said . `` if we had , we could have announced something a long time ago . '' there has been `` genuine progress '' over the past 16 months since a joint plan was agreed and in his conversations with zarif of the past few days , kerry said . the international powers wo n't rush the process , he said , but the negotiations are at a decisive point . `` we recognize that fundamental decisions have to be made now and they do n't get any easier as time goes by , '' he said . `` it is time to make hard decisions . we want the right deal that would make the world , including the united states and our closest partners and allies , safer and more secure , and that is our test . '' u.s. president barack obama has made clear that he wants to achieve a `` comprehensive and durable agreement '' that is based on intensive verification of its implementation rather than trust , kerry added . `` we have not yet reached the finish line but , make no mistake , we have the opportunity to get this right , '' he said . while in london , kerry met with his counterparts from the uk , germany and france , as well as the european union foreign policy chief , to discuss their coordinated approach . british foreign minister philip hammond spoke for the group , echoing kerry but saying while `` substantial progress has been made in some areas , '' there were other areas that lacked agreement . `` the time has come now for iran in particular to make some very tough decisions if we are going to see progress made , '' hammond said . kerry also spoke friday by phone with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and chinese foreign minister wang yi . the iranian president 's guarded optimism saturday -- which also happens to be nowruz , a holiday marking the start of spring and beginning of a new year in the persian calendar -- jibes with the progress cited recently by the iranians ' counterparts in the talks . western officials said friday that the ongoing negotiations have led to compromises on some crucial issues that have long divided the west and iran . specifically , the parties are coalescing around an idea that iran could keep 6,000 centrifuges in any deal , down from the 6,500 that had been under discussion , two western diplomats told cnn . the pace of relief from sanctions is a sticking point for iran , according to a western official . iranian negotiators want them lifted immediately , while u.s. and european negotiators prefer they be phased out over several years , contingent on iran meeting its end of the bargain . the debate has generated heated disagreements not only in switzerland , but also in washington , where israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu spoke to congress on march 3 at the invitation of republican leaders to warn about any nuclear deal with iran . the speech was made without the approval of u.s. president barack obama . the next week , an open letter signed by 47 republican senators , addressing iran 's leadership , noted that any agreement made with the u.s. administration that is not approved by the senate could be nullified by obama 's successor . late thursday , obama reached out `` directly to the people and leaders of iran , '' in a video message recorded ostensibly for nowruz , to urge them to back a deal curtailing tehran 's nuclear program . `` this year we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries , '' obama said . '' ... together we have to speak up for the future we seek ... i believe our countries should be able to resolve this issue peacefully with diplomacy . '' but iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , in his own nowruz address on saturday , noted the political divisions within the united states over the nuclear talks , iran 's state-run press tv reported . he suggested the u.s. president 's nowruz message `` included dishonest assertions and his claim of friendship for iranian people was not sincere , '' he is quoted as saying . khamenei also said obama had claimed falsely that some people in iran did not back a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue . what they are in fact resisting is the bullying approach of the united states , he said , according to press tv . the ayatollah also insisted that the removal of sanctions should be part of the negotiations , not a step that only followed the implementation of a deal . `` iran will never accept this , '' he said . `` this is the americans ' ploy . removal of sanctions should be part of any agreement .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- new zealand are on course for a first ever world cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over south africa , secured off the penultimate ball of the match . chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at eden park , grant elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the auckland crowd into raptures . it is the first time new zealand has ever reached a world cup final , and it will play either australia or india on sunday . te pair face each other in sydney on thursday . not the first time in the sport , rain played a part . south africa were motoring with the bat before a two-hour delay for poor weather . though its total was escalated by the duckworth/lewis method -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- new zealand held firm thanks to elliott . his 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow , smashing dale steyn for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at eden park . `` i do n't think this win is for myself or the team , but everyone here , '' elliott said at the post-match presentation . `` the supporters have been amazing . `` i think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection . i was n't as calm as i looked . when you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball ... `` it has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd . we have had a good run . it is the first final we have been in as new zealand . `` we are a very level team , we will approach it as any other game . nothing going in my mind when i hit the six . i do n't even know where the ball went . '' south africa , who themselves have never reached the final , have been accused of choking in past installments of the one-day competition . but that indictment can not be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in world cup history . it had recovered from 114-3 in the 27th over to 216-3 after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain ab de villiers and faf du plessis , before the rain came . with the game stopped for two hours , it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs , du plessis top scoring with 82 . new zealand 's target was upgraded via duckworth/lewis , a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost , to 298 . kiwi skipper brendan mccullum got it off to a fast start with a 22-ball half-century but after he was dismissed it wobbled , and needed 139 from 22 overs . but elliott was the steadying hand , judging his innings perfectly . and though he was dropped in the penultimate over , he struck the telling blow off steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on south africa . `` it was a great advertisement for cricket , '' mccullum said at the post-match presentation . `` everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives . `` what a great innings from grant . he came out of wilderness not long ago . the greatest time of our lives . we have enjoyed the experience . `` i hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are . gee it would be nice to win it . we do n't mind whom we face in the final . `` they are both quality sides , but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance . '' should australia beat india at the sydney cricket ground , then the joint hosts of the world cup will meet in the final in melbourne . `` it was an amazing game of cricket , '' ab de villiers said . `` probably the most electric crowd i have ever heard in my life . i guess the best team has come out on top . we gave it our best . no regrets . `` we left it all out there . it is hurting . it is going to take a while to recover . the bigger picture is for the people back home . we play for them . i hope they can still be proud of us .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the iran nuclear negotiations in lausanne , switzerland , reportedly have made substantive progress , inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the p5 +1 and iran . while the talks continued to unfold this week , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu restated his concern about an agreement with iran , vowing `` to continue to act against any threat . '' if an agreement is reached , the international spotlight will turn to israel , in anticipation of its possible reaction . israeli defense minister moshe `` bogy '' yaalon stated that a deal is `` a tragedy for the whole world . '' the question is , however , what can israel really do once a deal is signed ? in recent days , notable conservatives in the united states have attacked president barack obama 's handling of the negotiations with iran , arguing that a bad deal will force israel 's hand , leaving it with no choice but to attack iranian targets . but is this a realistic conclusion ? israel 's stated `` all options are on the table '' policy toward iran has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem can not be reached or is not to its liking , israel can decide to opt for a military strike on iran 's nuclear facilities . thirty-four years after the successful israeli bombing of the osirak nuclear facility in iraq , military experts have little doubt that the israeli air force today is capable of reaching iranian airspace and bombing targets above and below ground . therefore , the question is not one of military capability but more about domestic political and geopolitical strategy . with an iran deal in place , the israeli leadership may face stern objections from the heads of the israeli defense establishment , which will make it difficult but not impossible to take such a decision . nevertheless , if it remains keen on pursuing a military option , the israeli leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision : . • a successful military strike on iranian installations may degrade iran 's nuclear program , setting it back several years , but it would not completely eliminate iran 's nuclear capabilities . iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack , with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program , in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability . a deal between the p5 +1 -lrb- the united states , china , france , russia , united kingdom and germany -rrb- and iran is expected to include a 10-year -lrb- or more -rrb- `` sunset provision '' that is much longer than the period it will take iran to get its program back on track in case of an israeli attack . • a military attack against iran after a deal is signed would put israel on a collision course with the p5 + 1 , who were negotiating the contours of a deal with iran , as well as with other members of the international community . bilateral ties and cooperation with member states of the p5 +1 may suffer , as well as intelligence sharing between the relevant intelligence agencies . in addition , countries are likely to seek ways to `` punish '' israel for its actions , in the form of a u.n. general assembly or security council resolution condemning israeli behavior , calling for operative measures against the jewish state . • an israeli attack would likely lead to the collapse of the international sanctions regime on iran , which israel has worked to consolidate and which has been a very effective mechanism in pressuring iran . • the understanding between israel and moderate arab regimes on the need to prevent a nuclear iran would not be likely to dissipate in the aftermath of an attack , but israeli-arab coordination and cooperation on this issue is bound to suffer . • finally , an israeli attack would spark a direct iranian military reaction against israel , as well as an indirect reaction against israel in the region by iran 's proxies hezbollah -lrb- from southern lebanon and war-torn syria -rrb- and hamas -lrb- from gaza and perhaps the west bank -rrb- and against israeli targets abroad . in the aftermath of a deal with iran , israel 's response is expected to be harsh . it will include strong public criticism of the deal , a vow to continue the fight against the agreement in the u.s. congress and other relevant venues , a call for the international community to continue the sanctions regime , and a pursuit of coordinated public messaging with moderate arab regimes on this issue . these israeli public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of iran 's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts . opting for a military strike against iran , however , must take into consideration the consequences of such a decision . in light of all that is at stake , it does not seem like a plausible option at present .
sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- at any moment , saudi troops could march through yemen , heating up an already intense conflict that could have ramifications across the middle east . on monday , a saudi-led coalition of nine countries continued airstrikes against shiite houthi rebels , who have captured key parts of yemen and ousted that country 's president , and who could spread iran 's influence in the region . and the notion of an iranian proxy power in yemen is unacceptable to many -- especially iran 's staunch rival saudi arabia . ` tricky issues ' remain in nuclear talks with iran . `` i think the saudis ... feel directly , physically threatened by what is happening , '' said richard haass , president of the council on foreign relations . but if the coalition takes the fight to the ground in yemen , the consequences could be severe . houthis are battle-hardened guerrilla fighters and could cross into saudi arabia . they 've already threatened suicide bomb attacks inside saudi arabia . and yemen , already the home base to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , now teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state and an even more fertile breeding ground for extremism . here 's the latest on the crisis in yemen and its impact around the world : . saudi-led airstrikes targeted houthi military posts and weapons depots in the capital city of sanaa on monday , two houthi commanders told cnn . yemen 's defense ministry said a saudi airstrike hit al-mazeraq refugee camp in haradh , near the saudi border , killing at least 40 internally displaced people and injuring 250 . the group medecins sans frontieres -lrb- doctors without borders -rrb- tweeted that one of its teams had received `` 30 wounded plus 15 dead bodies following airstrike on idp camp today . '' previously , airstrikes hit houthi militant groups , smashed their air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure , a saudi official has said . egyptian warships fired on the road that runs from the yemeni port town of zinjibar into the key coastal city of aden but did not fire on aden directly , according to an official with yemen 's southern movement . the road is the eastern approach to aden and is one of the three main roads into the city . the egyptian naval barrage is intended to block the houthi advance on aden and push those fighters back , the source said . egyptian warships had deployed to the bab al-mandab strait last friday , according to media reports , intent on protecting that passage that is the only access from the arabian sea to egypt 's suez canal . the coalition 's campaign has been dubbed operation al-hazm storm . the arabic term `` al-hazm '' can be translated as `` determinant '' or `` decisive . '' saudi arabia and egypt have both talked about the possibility of putting boots on the ground . on saturday , yemeni foreign minister riyadh yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in yemen within days . saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in , they wo n't leave until they have degraded the houthis ' ability to fight . the houthis are apt guerrillas . a fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy . the conflict splits the region along religious lines . operation decisive storm 's largely sunni coalition includes saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , egypt and sudan . on monday , pakistan 's government said prime minister nawaz sharif had chaired `` a high-level meeting '' of senior officials to review the situation in the middle east . `` the meeting concluded that pakistan remains firmly committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of saudi arabia in accordance with the aspirations of the people of pakistan , '' it said in a statement . `` it was emphasized that pakistan stands committed to playing a meaningful role in arresting the deteriorating situation in the middle east . in the same context , and to facilitate early resolution of the crisis and to promote peace and unity of the muslim ummah -lrb- community -rrb- , the prime minister would be contacting the leadership of brotherly countries , '' the statement continued . the shiite houthis are allied with iran , a majority shiite nation . saudi arabia has accused iran of boosting the houthis ' weaponry for their offensive . iran has sharply denounced the saudi-dominated intervention in yemen . on sunday , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu accused iran of trying to use the conflict in yemen to `` take over the whole middle east . '' the united states has supported the coalition 's efforts . while it is helping the saudi-led team with logistics and locating targets , the u.s. is not participating in active battle . dozens have died in the airstrikes , houthi commanders said . the rebel commanders also said the coalition struck the houthi-controlled al anad air base , which was used as the headquarters for u.s. counterterrorism operations before houthi rebels took control of it . the houthis claimed they shot down a sudanese jet and captured the pilot on saturday . they distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim . the yemeni crisis erupted when shiite houthi rebels , who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country , began seizing the capital and other parts of the country last fall . houthis moved into sanaa in september , sparking battles that killed hundreds of people . yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi fled the capital over a month ago . in january , houthis surrounded the presidential palace . hadi resigned and was put under house arrest . he escaped in february and went to the coastal city of aden , but declared he was still the country 's leader . last week , hadi went to sharm el-sheikh , egypt , to attend the arab league summit , where he is rallying support for operation decisive storm . even from afar , hadi had strong words for the houthis : . `` you violated the sovereignty -lrb- of yemen -rrb- , '' he said , `` and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen . '' that arab league summit produced a notable agreement : the sharm el-sheikh declaration , which paves the way for a united arab force that would be ready to fight insurgents if a member country came under attack . egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi actually called for a joint arab force last month to fight isis . but the agreement over the weekend carries extra significance amid the battle against houthis in yemen . egypt : it 's time for an arab coalition against isis . the logistics and details of the joint arab force have yet to be worked out . but the declaration also urges the houthis to immediately withdraw from yemen 's government institutions and to surrender their arms to `` legitimate authorities . '' many u.n. representatives have had to flee the chaos . and saudi naval special forces have rescued dozens of diplomats , a saudi official said . the conflict in yemen also led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces earlier this month , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . haass , of the council on foreign relations , said what 's happening in yemen could devolve into a long , protracted religious war . `` you have civil wars , you have proxy wars . you have regional wars all in one , '' he said . `` and these things have so many logs on the fire , to use the metaphor , that they ... burn and burn and burn for a long time .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- swedish prosecutors have asked julian assange 's legal representatives whether the wikileaks founder would consent to be interviewed in london and have his dna taken via a swab . assange has been holed up in the ecuadorian embassy in london since june 2012 to avoid extradition to sweden , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another . swedish prosecutors have previously balked at coming to britain to question assange . however , a number of the crimes julian assange is suspected of will be subject to a statute of limitation in august 2015 , according to a statement from marianne ny , the director of public prosecutions . `` if assange gives his consent , the prosecutor will promptly submit a request for legal assistance to the british authorities to further continue the investigation , '' the statement said . a request will also be made to the ecuadorian authorities for permission to `` perform investigative measures '' at its london embassy , the statement said . ecuador granted assange political asylum in 2012 . assange 's defense lawyer , per e. samuelsson , said he called assange on friday morning with the news from the prosecution authority -- and that in principle they viewed the request positively . `` i think i woke him up , but he knew i was calling with news about the case since i called so early , '' samuelsson said . `` he was , of course , very happy that something is finally happening but he is irritated that it has taken such a long time . '' this is a step that assange and his team have been requesting for four years , samuelsson said . ny explained the logic behind the swedish authorities ' change of approach in her statement . `` my view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the ecuadorian embassy in london would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future , '' ny said . `` this assessment remains unchanged . now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without assange being present in sweden . '' the australian national has not been charged and denies the claims . he 's said he fears sweden would extradite him to the united states , where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through wikileaks . samuelsson said assange 's legal team would travel over to london as soon as possible to discuss ny 's request and that it expects to respond next week . `` the problem is that there are two more countries involved in this request so it might take some time to make all this happen , '' samuelsson said . samuelsson also said friday 's development was not a great surprise since sweden 's supreme court had last week asked the prosecutor general for an opinion on the case . `` we think that the prosecutor general , who has taken over the case , probably told prosecutor ny to interview assange in london , '' he said . assange has previously said the arrest warrant should be thrown out because , in part , swedish authorities declined to interview him at the ecuadorian embassy , thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he said should have concluded long ago . london 's metropolitan police said last month that the cost of the operation to guard the embassy to prevent assange fleeing had spiraled to more than 10 million pounds -lrb- $ 15.3 million . -rrb- overall . cnn 's claudia rebaza contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this valentine 's day , it 's likely that they came from kenya . the country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world , accounting for around 35 % of all sales in the european union . famed for being long-lasting , kenya 's roses , carnations and summer flowers are also popular in russia and the u.s. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the world floral expo in los angeles . the event is one of the industry 's largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world , with several ethiopian growers also representing the african continent alongside kenya . the country 's flower power is attributed to its sunny climate , which enables high-quality blossoms to be grown year-round without the need for expensive-to-run greenhouses . kenya also has excellent transport links to europe , and from there , the rest of the world through nairobi airport , which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables . this means that delicate floral cargo which is perishable in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly . more than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the kenya flower council , with roughly half of the country 's 127 flower farms concentrated around lake naivasha , around 90 kilometers northwest of nairobi . `` naivasha is a big center because it 's a freshwater lake and it is not very far from nairobi , which makes transport easy , '' says john kihia , technical director of floralife africa , a company which provides hydration , transport and storage for the cut-flower industry . `` people have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place , '' he adds . activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake , but local farmers have been working with the wwf in order to make sure that water levels are not affected : `` it 's about putting together a strong business case about why it 's good for growers to save water and ways to manage that , '' says drew mcvey , wwf technical adviser who calls the collaboration `` a story of success . '' naivasha lake 's location 1,884 meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium-sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of eu supermarkets , whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in russia : `` it 's a consumer preference . in moscow people will buy a single rose , so if it 's bigger it naturally looks more spectacular , whereas in the uk they buy bunches more often , '' says kihia . big business . horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for kenya , and the flower industry alone raked in around $ 600m last year , exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $ 507m in 2013 . nearly two thirds of exports are destined for holland , where they are resold to florists through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers : `` if you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product , people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price , '' kihia says . while europe remains the biggest destination for kenyan flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links , this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent , such as the recent recession . `` it has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand , which slows down business , '' says jane ngige , ceo of the kenyan flower council . kenyan exports also suffered when in october of last year the eu imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country , but the levy was lifted on christmas day allowing kenyan producers to storm valentine 's day sales . jane ngige says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as australia , canada and japan , and adds that direct flights from nairobi airport play a crucial role in helping the kenyan flower business take off globally : `` a direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality . it also makes it less expensive , '' she says . kenyan growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring rwanda by partnering with the country 's government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from rwanda 's capital kigali . it 's hoped that the park will eventually produce three million stems per year and kick-start rwanda 's floriculture sector , which could pump more than $ 200 million into the country 's economy by 2017 . editor 's note : each week , africa view explores the trends , figures and initiatives shaping africa . from education and energy to technology and innovation , it showcases topics and influential sectors driving countries on the continent .

mogadishu , somalia -lrb- cnn -rrb- islamic militants with the extremist group al-shabaab mounted a bloody attack thursday on government administration offices in baidoa , somalia . initial reports to police indicate that nine people , including four attackers , were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration , said col. mahad abdi , a somali police officer . the attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in baidoa city , some 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- northwest of the capital , mogadishu . heavy gunfire broke out between somali troops backed by ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president , sharif hassan sheikh aden . explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault , abdi said . al-shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack . a broadcast by the group 's official radio station , andulus , said that al-shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president 's house and killed seven ethiopian soldiers . the african union 's special representative for somalia , ambassador maman s. sidikou , condemned the attack , saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to baidoa . `` i am deeply saddened by news of the attack in baidoa this morning , '' he said in a statement released by amisom , the african union mission to somalia . sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a mogadishu hotel wednesday night . `` these are desperate attempts by al-shabaab to seek relevance , following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the somali national army working together with amisom troops , '' he said . al-shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of islamic law , or sharia . it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in somalia and beyond , even calling , in a video released last month , for attacks on shopping malls in canada , the united kingdom and the united states . u.s. authorities downplayed the threat . how big a threat is al-shabaab to the united states ? cnn 's laura smith-spark and nana karikari-apau contributed to this report .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- it might sound like a really old wives ' tale , but a thousand-year-old anglo-saxon potion for eye infections may hold the key to wiping out the modern-day superbug mrsa , according to new research . the 10th-century `` eyesalve '' remedy was discovered at the british library in a leather-bound volume of bald 's leechbook , widely considered to be one of the earliest known medical textbooks . christina lee , an expert on anglo-saxon society from the school of english at the university of nottingham , translated the ancient manuscript despite some ambiguities in the text . `` we chose this recipe in bald 's leechbook because it contains ingredients such as garlic that are currently investigated by other researchers on their potential antibiotic effectiveness , '' lee said in a video posted on the university 's website . `` and so we looked at a recipe that is fairly straightforward . it 's also a recipe where we are told it 's the ` best of leechdoms ' -- how could you not test that ? so we were curious . '' lee enlisted the help of the university 's microbiologists to see if the remedy actually worked . the recipe calls for two species of allium -lrb- garlic and onion or leek -rrb- , wine and oxgall -lrb- bile from a cow 's stomach -rrb- to be brewed in a brass vessel . `` we recreated the recipe as faithfully as we could . the bald gives very precise instructions for the ratio of different ingredients and for the way they should be combined before use , so we tried to follow that as closely as possible , '' said microbiologist freya harrison , who led the work in the lab at the school of life sciences . the book included an instruction for the recipe to be left to stand for nine days before being strained through a cloth . efforts to replicate the recipe exactly included finding wine from a vineyard known to have existed in the ninth century , according to steve diggle , an associate professor of sociomicrobiology , who also worked on the project . the researchers then tested their recipe on cultures of mrsa , methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments . the scientists were n't holding out much hope that it would work -- but they were astonished by the lab results . `` what we found was very interesting -- we found that bald 's eyesalve is incredibly potent as an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic in this context , '' harrison said . `` we were going from a mature , established population of a few billion cells , all stuck together in this highly protected biofilm coat , to really just a few thousand cells left alive . this is a massive , massive killing ability . '' diggle said the team also asked collaborators in the u.s. to test the recipe using an `` in vivo '' wound model -- meaning it 's in a live organism -- `` and basically the big surprise was that it seems to be more effective than conventional antibiotic treatment . '' the scientists were worried they would n't be able to repeat the feat . but three more batches , made from scratch each time , have yielded the same results , harrison said , and the salve appears to retain its potency for a long time after being stored in bottles in the refrigerator . the team says it now has good , replicated data showing that the medicine kills up to 90 % of mrsa bacteria in `` in vivo '' wound biopsies from mice . harrison says the researchers are still not completely sure how it works , but they have a few ideas -- namely , that there might be several active components in the mixture that work to attack the bacterial cells on different fronts , making it very hard for them to resist ; or that by combining the ingredients and leaving them to steep in alcohol , a new , more potent bacteria-fighting molecule is created in the process . `` i still ca n't quite believe how well this 1,000-year-old antibiotic actually seems to be working , '' harrison said . `` when we got the first results we were just utterly dumbfounded . we did not see this coming at all . '' she added : `` obviously you can never say with utter certainty that because it works in the lab it 's going to work as an antibiotic , but the potential of this to take on to the next stage and say , ` yeah , really does it work as an antibiotic ' is just beyond my wildest dreams , to be honest . '' lee , who translated the text from old english , believes the discovery could change people 's views of the medieval period as the `` dark ages . '' `` the middle ages are often seen as the ` dark ages ' -- we use the term ` medieval ' these days ... as pejorative -- and i just wanted to do something that explains to me how people in the middle ages looked at science , '' she said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` the law of the jungle , which never orders anything without a reason , forbids every beast to eat man . '' i still remember the first time i read the passage from `` the jungle book , '' heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with the six million dollar man . `` the real reason for this is that man-killing means , sooner or later , the arrival of white men on elephants , with guns , and hundreds of brown men with gongs , rockets and torches . then everybody in the jungle suffers , '' rudyard kipling wrote . i probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in milwaukee , but to my 11-year-old brain , kipling was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind piggly wiggly . `` the reason the beasts give among themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things , and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him . '' reading that passage 35 years later , while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic , the irony in that line finally clicks . when we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine , my grown-up heart pounds once again . it is a sign that there may be big cats nearby . `` i wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild ? and are they alive today ? '' these are the questions that launched this stop on `` the wonder list , '' and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century : is the planet still big enough for man and man-eater ? india is about one-third the size of the continental united states , with four times as many people . that kind of human pressure has changed kipling 's `` law of the jungle '' in dramatic ways . according to the animal conservation group born free , there are more tigers in cages in texas than in the forests of india . so i set out to understand how and why . having covered the poaching of african animals to feed the huge market for asian medicine , i assumed the demand for tiger-skin rugs in dubai or tiger-bone wine in beijing would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat . can tigers claw their way back from the brink ? but it turns out that tiger-human conflict is a much bigger problem . almost half a billion rural indians have no plumbing and answer nature 's call by squatting in the forest . most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey , and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow , as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge . and so , a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation . it is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead . but these efforts , along with a more pointed anti-poaching campaign , seem to be paying off . the latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in india , a 30 % increase over the previous count in 2011 . if the estimates hold , this would make india the only country in the world with a growing tiger population . but the human population is growing much faster . maintaining a healthy population of apex predators is just one new challenge on a planet that will welcome a couple billion more people in just the next generation . you 'll be surprised by the others as we seek india 's magnificent treasures -- both natural and man-made -- on the next episode of `` the wonder list .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- michael douglas ' son dylan had a run-in with anti-semitism -- and the actor wants to do something about it . in an opinion column for the los angeles times , the producer and `` wall street '' oscar winner described an incident last summer in an unidentified country in `` southern europe . '' the older of his two children with actress catherine zeta-jones , 14-year-old dylan , came to his father in tears . `` a man at the pool had started hurling insults at him , '' douglas writes . it was n't because of anything dylan did , he continued : `` suddenly i had an awful realization of what might have caused the man 's outrage : dylan was wearing a star of david . '' douglas went to talk to the man -- `` it was not a pleasant discussion , '' he writes -- and the incident has stayed in his mind . the 70-year-old actor , who was raised by a jewish father , kirk douglas , and a non-jewish mother , said he did n't identify as jewish while growing up but noticed anti-semitic remarks others made . `` with little knowledge of what it meant to be a jew , i found myself passionately defending the jewish people . now , half a century later , i have to defend my son , '' he writes . `` anti-semitism , i 've seen , is like a disease that goes dormant , flaring up with the next political trigger . '' douglas , who is also a united nations messenger of peace , observes that anti-semitism has been on the rise due to a number of factors , including income inequality , religious extremism and hatred of israel . `` some find jews to be a convenient scapegoat rather than looking at the real source of their problems , '' he says . he praises leaders such as pope francis , french prime minister manuel valls and cardinal timothy dolan of new york for their efforts at reconciliation and community-building . but it is n't enough , he adds . `` all of us '' must fight anti-semitism , he says . `` if we confront anti-semitism whenever we see it , if we combat it individually and as a society , and use whatever platform we have to denounce it , we can stop the spread of this madness , '' he writes . `` my son is strong . he is fortunate to live in a country where anti-semitism is rare . but now he too has learned of the dangers that he as a jew must face . it 's a lesson that i wish i did n't have to teach him , a lesson i hope he will never have to teach his children . '' douglas received the 2015 genesis prize for `` exceptional people whose values and achievements will inspire the next generation of jews . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- when indiana gov. michael pence signed his state 's religious freedom restoration act -lrb- rfra -rrb- , he apparently did not anticipate the resulting uproar . many of indiana 's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- persons . the ncaa has expressed concern about the final four , which indianapolis is hosting this weekend , and other companies have threatened to move their businesses outside of the state . but , when pushed on the issue , pence insisted that the law is `` not about discrimination '' but instead is `` about protecting the religious liberty of every hoosier of every faith . '' when asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections , the governor doubled-down , noting that `` we 're not going to change this law . '' but members of the indiana legislature beg to differ with the governor , pledging to `` fix '' indiana 's rfra . and now , the governor has changed his tune , also calling for a fix to the bill . can there really be an easy `` fix , '' short of repealing the act ? the answer is , of course , it depends . under rfras like indiana 's , people are not free to disobey any law in tension with their religious convictions . instead , rfras create a standard to balance a person 's religious interests against the governmental policy at stake . under indiana 's rfra , the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue . the question would then become whether anti-discrimination laws advance a compelling interest in the least restrictive means . the answer to that question is easy : yes . the adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests , and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it , so they are the least restrictive means . at present in indiana , there is no state-level law that protects lgbt persons from discrimination by private parties . in certain cities and other , local jurisdictions , however , there are ordinances prohibiting such discrimination . indiana would have two ways to `` fix '' the rfra problem . the first would be to adopt state-wide nondiscrimination laws that protect lgbt persons . such an act would confirm that , as a matter of state policy , protecting the lgbt community is viewed as a compelling state interest . this would bring indiana into alignment with illinois , which has a rfra , but which also has a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute , ameliorating any concerns about the rfra being used in discriminatory fashion . given the wishy-washy answer that gov. pence provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against lgbt persons was appropriate , the likelihood of indiana adopting a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute seems remote at best , eliminating this fix as an option . another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal , state , or local nondiscrimination laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the rfra . importantly , federal law does not protect lgbt persons from discrimination by private actors , and neither does indiana state law . but this language would expressly carve out local ordinances from the scope of the rfra , such as the nondiscrimination ordinance in indianapolis . in essence , this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the rfra : absent local nondiscrimination laws , persons are free in indiana to discriminate against lgbt persons on any basis . this amendment , however , would make clear that the state-level rfra can not be used to trump local city ordinances that protect the lgbt community . what are the odds of this second fix ? well , that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the georgia legislature as it considered a rfra comparable to indiana 's . the result : the bill 's sponsors tabled it , noting that the exception for local nondiscrimination laws would `` gut '' the bill . that reaction shines a light on the true motivations for these rfras . if these acts are n't about discrimination , then why would ensuring nondiscrimination protections `` gut '' the bill ? it 's because these bills truly are about permitting discrimination against the lgbt community . all of the hand-waving by gov. pence and others can not distract from the truth : rfras are the first responses to lgbt advances .

london -lrb- cnn -rrb- previously secret correspondence between britain 's prince charles and government officials is to be made public after a supreme court ruling thursday . the guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005 . charles is next in line to the british throne and as king would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality . some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a `` meddling king , '' attempting to influence politicians . after the judgment was released thursday , guardian editor-in-chief alan rusbridger said the paper was `` delighted '' about the supreme court 's decision after what he said was a `` brilliant 10-year campaign by guardian reporter rob evans . '' `` the government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters , admitting their publication would ` seriously damage ' perceptions of the prince 's political neutrality . now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment , '' rusbridger said . max foster , cnn 's royal correspondent , says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne . `` these were private letters , never meant for public consumption , which is why the prince 's office has resisted their release , '' he said . `` but they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy . should charles be getting involved in politics at all when , as head of state , he 'll be expected to be politically neutral ? he 's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway . '' prime minister david cameron said the judgment was `` disappointing '' and the government would now look at how to release the letters . `` this is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially . i think most people would agree this is fair enough , '' he said . cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision : `` our foi -lrb- freedom of information -rrb- laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto , which we exercised in this case for a reason . if the legislation does not make parliament 's intentions for the veto clear enough , then we will need to make it clearer . '' the prince 's official residence , clarence house , issued a brief statement about the decision . `` this is a matter for the government . clarence house is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld . '' the anti-monarchy group republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the freedom of information act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk . `` the government must now act to end royal secrecy . any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret , '' ceo graham smith said . `` we ca n't have a situation where we do n't know what influence charles is having on government policy . '' in a statement issued on the eve of the decision , smith branded the monarchy one of britain 's `` most secretive institutions . '' `` charles clearly has his own political agenda , yet his name wo n't be on the ballot in may . so we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy . '' evans , the guardian reporter , had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between charles and various government departments under the uk 's freedom of information act and environmental regulations . after the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests , evans appealed to the information tribunal , which referred the matter to the upper tribunal . the guardian reported in 2009 that charles had written to treasury , foreign office and education department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials . `` the disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king , '' the paper said . the upper tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters , `` advocacy correspondence , '' should be disclosed , but its decision was vetoed by britain 's attorney general , who issued a certificate overriding it . explaining his decision , the attorney general said that in that his view , the correspondence was `` undertaken as part of the prince of wales ' preparation for becoming king '' and contained nothing that outweighed `` strong public interest against disclosure . '' the guardian challenged the veto in court , but three high court judges dismissed it , so evans appealed to the supreme court , which on thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- britain 's lewis hamilton made the perfect start to his world title defense by winning the opening race of the f1 season in australia sunday to lead a mercedes one-two in melbourne . polesitter hamilton controlled the race on the albert park street circuit to win from teammate nico rosberg of germany . four-time world champion sebastian vettel took the final podium position for his new team ferrari , holding off felipe massa in the willams . it was the 34th career victory for two-time world champion hamilton and underlined the continued dominance of mercedes as he and rosberg pulled well clear of their nearest challengers . hamilton , who was forced to retire early in last year 's australian grand prix , was taking the checkered flag in melbourne for the first time since 2008 , when he claimed his first world title for mclaren . it had all gone completely to plan until coming face to face on the victory podium with movie legend arnold schwarzenegger , who was conducting the post-race interviews . `` hey man , wow , '' said a surprised hamilton . `` it is an incredibly feeling to continue winning but also great to be up here with you . '' then taking his courage in his hands , hamilton cheekily told ` the terminator ' `` i thought you were taller ! '' after getting the thoughts of rosberg and vettel , who said it was a `` very big honor '' to gain his first points for ferrari , schwarzenegger turned his attention back to hamilton . the pair signed off by saying together : `` i 'll be back , '' the catchphrase from schwarzenegger 's iconic 1984 film . with hamilton winning his seventh race from eight starts , his f1 rivals would probably rather he stayed away and rosberg admitted `` he was driving to his max '' but could not match the pace of his teammate . only 11 cars finished the race from a depleted grid of 15 cars , with valtteri bottas unable to start for williams due to a back injury . pastor maldonado crashed out on the first lap as the safety car was deployed , while his teammate romain grosjean retired early in the 58-lap race to complete a miserable afternoon for lotus . britain 's jenson button in an uncompetitive mclaren was the only driver to finish without a point in 11th place . his regular teammate fernando alonso sat out the race after his nasty crash in pre-season testing in barcelona , while stand-in kevin magnussen retired after the warm-up lap . kimi raikkonen looked set to underline ferrari 's improvement when running in fifth place , but had to retire the car , with tv replays indicating his left rear tire was not fitted properly after a pit stop . it left the way clear for rookie felipe nasr of brazil to claim an unexpected fifth place for sauber , which went through the 2014 season without claiming a single point , and also took eighth spot with marcus ericsson . home hopes rested with daniel ricciardo , third in last year 's title race , but he looked off the pace in the red bull in sixth place . force india pair nico hulkenberg and sergio perez finished seventh and 10th , with carlos sainz jr. impressing on his f1 debut for toro rosso in ninth . dutch teenager max verstappen made f1 history by becoming the youngest driver to compete in an f1 race at 17 years and 166 days , but his hopes were dashed when forced to retire in his toro rosso on the 34th lap .

'' spieth has long been heralded as the next big thing in golf -- shining in the amateur ranks with two u.s. junior titles and leading last year 's masters after the third round before eventually finishing tied for second , three shots behind bubba watson . on sunday , he held his nerve at the innisbrook resort in palm harbor , florida , to hold on for the victory . he first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff , which he duly holed . it was a putt of similar length that ensured a second tour win to add to his john deere classic success in july 2013 , which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest pga tour winner for 82 years at the time .

'' ` gift horse ' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and i hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth , '' johnson said . the 13-feet high bronze skeleton is a `` wry comment , '' organizers say , on the equestrian statue of king william iv originally planned , but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago . further nods to the past and the sculpture 's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving `` the anatomy of a horse '' by english artist george stubbs , whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the national gallery on trafalgar square 's north side . one of london 's most famous landmarks , trafalgar square is popular with tourists . named after a famed 1805 british naval victory against the french , its centerpiece is a column commemorating lord horatio nelson , who died during the conflict . in a career spanning half-a-century , haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art , power and money through installations , paintings , photography and written text . many of haacke 's most famous works have explored systems , be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work `` condensation cube '' -- or the social and political as seen in `` moma poll '' -lrb- 1970 -rrb- , `` a breed apart '' -lrb- 1978 -rrb- and more recently his `` der bevölkerung '' -lrb- the people -rrb- installed in germany 's reichstag building in berlin in 2000 . `` it 's a very prominent spot , '' said the 78-year-old , reflecting on the `` gift horse 's '' positioning in trafalgar square , `` it 's very beautiful . everybody sees it . '' `` there are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea , '' added haacke . around trafalgar square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture . `` it definitely does n't look like a horse 's head , does it ? looks more dinosaur-ish to me , '' said a slightly baffled female day-tripper from wales , while another tourist seemed equally confused . `` my first impression was that it looked like an alien , because you see it and then you think , huh ? what is it ? '' said toni , visiting from switzerland . local reaction was more positive though . `` i just think it 's very witty , '' said londoner tony francis . `` i can see the -lrb- george -rrb- stubbs influence . and i love the stock exchange -lrb- ribbon -rrb- scrolling round and the way they merge into each other . '' `` gift horse '' is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the `` hahn/cock , '' created by german artist katharina fritsch which was in residence from july 2013 to february this year .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- i was deeply moved watching julianne moore win the oscar for `` still alice , '' a movie i was proud and privileged to be an executive producer on . julianne gives a harrowing performance as a brilliant 50-year-old college professor who loses her brain and herself to early-onset alzheimer 's disease . this is a huge moment for julianne -- and a huge moment for all of us who have been trying to focus public attention on this staggering disease . witnessing alzheimer 's progress on the big screen is as terrifying as it is in real life . i know , because i 'm a child of alzheimer 's . the mind of my father , sargent shriver , had always been a finely tuned instrument that left people in awe and inspired . but my family and i watched alzheimer 's erase that brain -- slowly , inexorably , completely . it was terrifying , too , because back then , the disease was surrounded by shame and silence . alzheimer 's still carries a stigma of the unknown -- even though today more than 5 million americans have it . that 's right . every 67 seconds , another one of us develops alzheimer 's . women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop alzheimer 's as breast cancer . with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day , there will be 13.5 million of us with alzheimer 's by 2050 . and many people do n't understand that alzheimer 's is n't a natural part of aging . alzheimer 's is a disease that kills . the truth is , we 're right in the middle of an epidemic , but we as a nation are in denial . an oscar for `` still alice '' is shining the brightest light yet on alzheimer 's , but light is n't enough anymore . attention is n't enough . it 's time to get serious . alzheimer 's is exerting a powerful impact on american families -- on our health , our finances , and our futures . and women are disproportionately affected . why women ? back in 2010 , when we published `` the shriver report : a woman 's nation takes on alzheimer 's , '' we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with alzheimer 's and nearly two-thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it . now those numbers are far worse . today nearly two-thirds of those with alzheimer 's are women -- that 's more than 3.2 million women . and more than 60 % of caregivers for people with alzheimer 's and dementia are women , with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones . opinion : why ` still alice ' is about you . women are the epicenter of this crisis , which is why i believe they also have to be the solution . so , in partnership with the alzheimer 's association and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease , we have launched the wipe out alzheimer 's challenge , a multipronged campaign powered by women 's brains . our mission is to enlist women of all ages to get educated , engaged and empowered to instigate change . women around the country will go out and raise the alarm , raise awareness , raise the stakes and raise millions of dollars to fund serious research into women 's brains . and there 's so much research to do and so many questions to answer . why is the incidence of alzheimer 's higher for women ? nobody knows . and why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get alzheimer 's than breast cancer ? nobody knows . what 's the exact role of estrogen ? we do n't know . is there an alzheimer 's connection with depression or with diabetes ? what about genetics ? what can be done during the 20 or so years when the disease develops , before a woman even becomes symptomatic ? what 's the impact of diet , stress level , exercise , sleep and cardiovascular condition ? it 's time to find out . we have to fund this research , because for some reason it 's not a priority for the government . in 2015 , washington will spend an estimated $ 6 billion on cancer research and $ 3 billion on hiv/aids research , but only $ 586 million on alzheimer 's . yet , as the alzheimer 's association tells us , `` the costs to all payers for the care of people living with alzheimer 's disease and other dementias will total an estimated $ 226 billion , with medicare and medicaid paying 68 percent of the costs . '' i do n't get it , but i 'm not going to wait anymore . so wipe out alzheimer 's is stepping in . we 're asking women to put together their own `` brain trusts '' in their communities -- groups that will go out and do some muscular fund-raising . but equally important , these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and is n't . what are the warning signs we should look for in ourselves and our parents ? what 's the difference between normal forgetfulness , dementia and alzheimer 's disease ? can brain games or meditation slow cognitive decline ? do dietary supplements help ? local brain trust groups will also learn about the devastatingly high cost of alzheimer 's -- how neither medicare nor the affordable care act covers long-term care , and the cost of a semiprivate nursing home room averages more than $ 80,000 a year . they 'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have alzheimer 's . they will be politically engaged and encourage political candidates who support increased funding for alzheimer 's research . they 'll push their own doctors to get better-educated about cognitive health . it 's time for the narrative around alzheimer 's to change . i remember when an hiv/aids diagnosis was a death sentence . i remember when cancer was a dirty word , and the prognosis was always grim . but aids and cancer activists are helping to take these diseases from terrifying to treatable , from hopeless to hopeful . we want to do the same with alzheimer 's . we want to understand it , prevent it , treat it and beat it . wipe out alzheimer 's is creating a global community of women activists , agitators and agents of change to do just that . we used to think that the mysterious condition called alzheimer 's disease happened only to folks in their 80s and 90s . `` still alice '' shows us that 's just not true . the race for the oscar may be over , but the race to wipe out alzheimer 's is on .
lausanne , switzerland -lrb- cnn -rrb- talks to reach a deal on a framework agreement on iran 's nuclear program will be extended an extra day , u.s. officials said tuesday . '' we 've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until wednesday . there are several difficult issues still remaining , '' state department spokeswoman marie harf said . white house press secretary josh earnest said the talks in lausanne would continue another day as `` long as the conversations continue to be productive . '' diplomats and negotiators worked late as an initial deadline approached , but more time appeared necessary to reach a framework deal . how long talks will continue was unclear . french foreign minister laurent fabius informed the iranians that he will return to paris at dawn wednesday in an apparent effort to force the iranians ' hand , western diplomatic sources told cnn . hamid ba'idinejad from iran 's foreign ministry said earlier tuesday there are no `` artificial '' deadlines and a deal will be reached , when each issue has been resolved . diplomats told cnn that there has been progress , but gaps remain . for iran , that means there 's a light at the end of the tunnel for crippling sanctions . for the west , it means real hope that it 's possible to loosen up on tehran while still being confident that it wo n't develop nuclear weapons . the international sanctions relief issue has been resolved , according to ba'idinejad . `` we have had long discussions on this , but there are issues that are related to sanctions that are still under consideration , '' ba'idinejad said . he added that is not the only issue that needs to be worked out . the thing is , nuclear physics is complicated . so are the international dynamics anytime you 're talking about iran and the west , with mutual distrust and contempt a shared sentiment for years . that 's why it 's taken so long to even get to this point , and why what 's happening in lausanne matters . before you can iron out nitty-gritty technical details in a permanent , comprehensive pact -- which carries the more important deadline of june 30 -- you have to agree on what you 're going to talk about . what happens if wednesday passes and there 's no framework agreement ? in the short term , it appears , not much . iran 's power rises , with or without deal . the real deadline is n't for three months , after all . as for the march 31 date , there 's nothing to stop the parties from continuing to talk -- though an iranian official told state-run press tv that no one had raised the idea of an extension as of late monday . `` all emphasize that the chance should not be missed , and they are all doing their best , '' ba'idinejad said . so far , there 's been a lot of meetings , with occasional smiles for cameras followed by foreign ministers talking behind closed doors . after working through the previous night , representatives from the key players -- most of them foreign ministers -- met all day tuesday to try to resolve differences in what chinese foreign minister wang yi described as `` the final stage '' of `` these marathon-like negotiations . '' the parties are either on the verge of a milestone agreement or still separated on some crucial points , depending on who you listen to . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov is among the optimists . russia has been closer than most to iran even as it 's gone along with sanctions . `` prospects for this round of talks are not bad , i would even say good , '' lavrov said before heading to switzerland for the final round of negotiations , according to state-run sputnik news agency . `` the chances are high . '' but in comments monday to cnn , a more cautious kerry conceded there was `` a little more light there today , but there are still some tricky issues . '' `` there still remain some difficult issues , '' the top u.s. diplomat said . `` we are working very hard to work those through ... with a view to get something done . '' 21 questions on iranian nuclear talks . iran has been under intense international pressure and has faced crippling sanctions over its nuclear program for years . the sides began moving away from stalemate with iranians ' 2013 election of president hassan rouhani , who has insisted that iran wants a peaceful nuclear energy program but not weapons . viewed as a moderate -- especially compared with other powerful figures in iran , including the country 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei -- rouhani campaigned on a platform that he 'd work to help iran 's economy by reducing its rifts with the outside world . his government has had some success easing those tensions , spearheading interim agreements that have loosened some sanctions . but a comprehensive and final deal has remained elusive . there 's been discussion on what to do with iran 's existing fissile material -- which is important because , as long as it 's still around , that will make it easier to produce a nuclear weapon more quickly . still , u.s. officials suggested monday the debate over this has been overblown , with harf calling it one outstanding issue though `` it has n't , quite honestly , been one of the toughest ones . '' more important are three points that have dominated the talks in lausanne : . • how quickly or slowly iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement . • how quickly the crushing u.n. sanctions will go away . • whether sanctions will snap back into place if iran violates the deal . iran wants them gone for good . lavrov claims that the u.n. security council will lift the sanctions right away , but other international negotiators want to merely suspend them , so they can be reapplied as leverage if iran does not keep its end of the bargain . agreement on those points is crucial , a western diplomat said . `` there can not be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions , '' the diplomat said . another point of contention : what to do with the nuclear substances iran already has . diplomats had told journalists about a plan for iran to ship its fissile material to russia . the idea is that if tehran does n't have a nuclear stockpile at its fingertips , it will have a longer `` breakout time '' to make a nuclear weapon should negotiations fall apart . iran is n't ready to do that , one of its negotiators said sunday . `` the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , '' iranian deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi said , `` and we do not intend to send them abroad . '' but on monday , u.s. officials said the rumblings in the media about the stockpile issue were overblown . negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material , and iran has made the comments many times before , a senior state department official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports . with or without a deal , a lot can change in the next three months . for one , the devil is in the details -- any one of which could throw everyone back to square one . then there 's the possibility that a deal ironed out in switzerland is rejected by any of the key players . that 's been raised as a possibility in the united states , even though a washington post-abc news poll conducted in the past few days found that 59 % of respondents support a deal in iran that would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions . earlier this month , 47 republican senators wrote directly to the iranian government , reminding it that any deal it reaches with u.s. president barack obama might be moot once his term ends in less than two years . one person leading the charge against a possible deal , even though he 'll have no direct part in shaping it , is israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . reiterating points he made earlier this month to the u.s. congress , netanyahu said tuesday `` the greatest threat to our security and safety and our future is iranians ' attempt to become nuclear . '' `` and the agreement that is being formed in lausanne , '' the israeli leader said , `` is paving the road to that result .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it was nothing if not predictable . take combustible issues like religion and sexuality , stir in a new law and talk of a boycott , then -- boom ! -- the debate on social media explodes . and so it has proved with indiana 's new `` religious freedom '' law , signed thursday by gov. mike pence . the new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner 's religious beliefs . supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose . opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty . the debate is nothing if not vitriolic . and colorful , too . `` libs shutup , '' reads one tweet , which goes on to assert that indiana 's `` relgious freedom restauration act -lrb- sic -rrb- '' is modeled on federal legislation signed by president bill clinton in 1993 . people on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and , it seems for the moment , more numerous . some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people , if perchance their religion dictated that . others say that indiana seems out of step with modern times . and then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that , law or no law , they have no intention of turning anyone away . `` my team just canceled travel to in due to the #religiousfreedomrestorationact , '' tweeted a user under the name mark c somerville , who says he works for @salesforce . `` we stand against discrimination . '' and a tweet from a the st. elmo steak house , a business in indianapolis , the state 's capital and its largest city , pledged in capital letters to continue serving all . the word freedom should only be used when it 's inclusive and fair for all . supporters of the law , however , made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott . `` before you go and get too self-righteous w / your #boycottindiana , '' a user called caleb parke tweeted , '' @govpencein is protecting #religiousfreedom for everyone ! #equalrights . ''
jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- within 48 hours of his election night victory , benjamin netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no palestinian state if he were prime minister , but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations : the united states and the palestinians . in an interview with nbc , netanyahu said , `` i have n't changed my policy , i never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized palestinian state that recognizes the jewish state . what has changed is the reality , abu mazen -lrb- nickhame of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas -rrb- the palestinian leader refuses to recognize the jewish state , and he 's made a pact with hamas that calls for the destruction of israel . and every territory vacated these days in the middle east is taken up by islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace . i do n't want a one-state solution , i want a sustainable two-state solution . '' chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution . he says the palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations . `` i 've negotiated with them for 20 years , and i complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator , '' erekat said . `` all netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust , not only of me but of the international community , he needs to stand tall and tell the israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we 're going to have to recognize the state of palestine . '' erekat says the palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the united nations , a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full un member state in december . a new united nations security council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second palestinian bid . so where does that leave the united states ? the white house said it would `` reassess '' the relationship between the united states and israel . the broad relationship includes security cooperation , financial assistance , and strong diplomatic ties . both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the israeli elections . but the united states has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the u.n. security council to block resolutions unfavorable to israel . some of that protection could be at stake here as the white house urges both sides back to negotiations . the last peace talks , moderated by secretary of state john kerry , broke down in april 2014 after nine months of negotiations . as the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline , israel withdrew from the negotiations when fatah announced a reconciliation with hamas , a militant islamic group , and an intention to form a unity government . in a phone call with netanyahu , president barack obama congratulated netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution . but with so much skepticism on both sides , a lasting peace remains a distant goal .

lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- with partial results reported in the nigerian presidential election , it appears opposition candidate muhammadu buhari is leading incumbent president goodluck jonathan . reuters , which has collated results from three-quarters of nigeria 's states as they 're broadcast live on state tv , reported that buhari has so far obtained 11.5 million votes , jonathan 9.5 million . electoral officers from each of the 36 states are taking turns declaring results from their respective states at the independent national electoral commission . the vote count was stopped monday night and will resume at 10 a.m. tuesday -lrb- 5 a.m. et -rrb- , according to a tweet from attahiru jega , the chairman of the electoral commission . jega will be the one to announce final results . violent protests after nigeria 's presidential elections saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the united states and britain against political interference . protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in nigeria 's oil-rich rivers state on sunday as they marched to protest the elections , amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation . heavy rain eventually forced the protesters to leave , but there are fears it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence . more than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across nigeria 's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate . now nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule . the two main candidates are incumbent jonathan of the peoples democratic party and retired buhari of all progressives congress . jonathan and buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to `` free , fair and credible elections '' after their signing of the abuja accord in january . after the protests in rivers , buhari 's all progressives congress demanded the elections there be canceled . `` there 's been so much violence in rivers state that it 's just not tenable , '' party spokesman lai mohammed said . but the peoples democratic party disputed the accusation , saying the election was `` credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of rivers state to support president goodluck jonathan . '' `` we are concerned by what seems to be happening , '' said jega , the election chairman , about events in rivers . voting ended after problems with ballot papers and digital voting cards saw it extended to sunday in some areas . read more : nigerian election extended one day . britain and the united states entered the fray monday with their top diplomats issuing a statement welcoming a `` largely peaceful vote '' but warning any political interference would contravene jonathan and buhari 's peace pact . `` so far , we have seen no evidence of systemic manipulation of the process . but there are disturbing indications that the collation process -- where the votes are finally counted -- may be subject to deliberate political interference . this would contravene the letter and spirit of the abuja accord , to which both major parties committed themselves , '' u.s. secretary of state john kerry and uk foreign secretary philip hammond said . responding to their joint statement , electoral commission spokesman kayode idowu said : `` for all that i know there is no sign of political interference in the collation procedure . '' idowu said the collation procedure `` can not be subject to interference as long as our representative is present . '' the fear is that the results may not be accepted by the loser . if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party , then the protests in rivers could spread to northern nigeria . both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm . `` i want to urge all nigerians to also wait patiently for the independent national electoral commission , inec , to collate and announce results , '' jonathan said on his facebook account . `` fellow nigerians , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced , '' said buhari on twitter . nigeria 's vote had been scheduled for february 14 , but on february 7 , nigeria 's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns , with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by extremist group boko haram . the controversial decision was unpopular among many nigerians and led to widespread protests . jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat boko haram , which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of sharia law in nigeria . on saturday , residents in the northeastern state of gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations , apparently by boko haram extremists . in other attacks not believed to be related to voting , suspected boko haram militants decapitated 23 people in a raid saturday night on buratai village in northeast nigeria 's borno state , according to residents and ibrahim adamu , a local politician in the village . meanwhile on monday , nigeria 's police force issued a statement saying police and a `` local vigilante group '' had foiled an attack by unknown gunmen on the town of tafawa balewa in northeastern bauchi state . the assailants had `` stormed tafawa balewa town in a convoy of 18 hilux vehicles and started firing sporadically , '' the statement said . after being forced to retreat and abandon four vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft machine guns , the attackers went to jitar village , where they killed three `` male vigilante members , '' police said . security forces had cordoned off the surrounding area , they said . read more : democracy was the real winner . christian purefoy reported from lagos and susannah cullinane wrote from london .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the bbc 's director-general , tony hall , has allegedly received death threats days after `` top gear '' host jeremy clarkson was dropped . `` police in westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill , '' the metropolitan police confirmed to cnn in a statement . the allegation was reported to the police on wednesday . `` the threat was made by email , '' the police added . `` the content of the message suggests -lrb- it was sent -rrb- from outside the uk . '' the alleged threats come shortly after hall took the decision to dismiss popular presenter clarkson from `` top gear , '' one of the most-watched television shows in the world . `` top gear '' was suspended march 10 after an apparent altercation between the motor show host and producer oisin tymon on march 4 . at the time , the bbc issued a statement saying that there had been a `` fracas '' between the host and a bbc producer . more than 1 million fans of clarkson and `` top gear '' signed a petition to reinstate the host . the document was delivered to the bbc 's headquarters by a fan dressed as the `` stig '' -- the incognito racing car test-driver who appeared regularly on the show -- driving an armored tank . on wednesday , the british broadcaster announced that it would not be renewing clarkson 's contract as host of `` top gear '' after he allegedly busted his producer 's lip and hurled verbal abuse at him . hall issued a statement online following the decision . `` it is with great regret that i have told jeremy clarkson today that the bbc will not be renewing his contract , '' he announced . `` it is not a decision i have taken lightly . i have done so only after a very careful consideration of the facts and after personally meeting both jeremy and oisin tymon .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- reigning world champion lewis hamilton and teammate nico rosberg resumed where they left off last season as the 2015 formula one season kicked off in melbourne . the mercedes duo , who took pole position in all but one of last season 's qualifying sessions and won 16 of the 19 races , were dominant in first and second practice for sunday 's australian grand prix . rosberg , who won last year 's gp at albert park , was fastest around the melbourne street circuit on friday , finishing 0.1 second ahead of hamilton with sebastian vettel taking third spot for his new team ferrari -- the german four-time world champion finished 0.715 seconds off the pace set by his compatriot . vettel 's finnish teammate , kimi raikkonen was fourth , 1.1 seconds behind the lead with williams ' valtteri bottas and daniel kvyat , who was making his debut for red bull since his switch from toro rosso , finishing fifth and sixth respectively . `` it was great to be back in the car at this awesome track , '' rosberg said , the official formula one site reported . `` today we have the evidence that our silver arrow is quick again and it was a great start for the team , '' he added . `` it seems again that it 's very close between lewis and me and he is a great driver , so i need to nail the setup every time to come out on top . this year will be a big battle again against him , i 'm sure . i 'm looking forward to the first weekend of the new season with all the great fans out there . '' hamilton , who was forced to retire from last year 's race with engine trouble , was satisfied with his pace . `` it feels great to be back on track and back into a race weekend . in general it 's been a good first day , '' hamilton said . `` today seemed to confirm that we have pretty good pace . but there are still other quick cars out there and we ca n't go into tomorrow 's sessions not thinking that they will be close . '' the opening day 's racing was somewhat overshadowed by an ongoing dispute between sauber and the swiss team 's 2014 reserve driver giedo van der garde . the 29-year-old dutchman recently started legal proceeding against the swiss team claiming they had reneged on a promise to make him one of the lead drivers for the 2015 season . van der garde won the case held in a swiss court earlier this month , with the decision being upheld by supreme court of victoria in australia on tuesday after sauber had appealed the original ruling . during practice van der garde could be seen in the sauber garage wearing his race overalls , but he did not make an appearance on track as marcus ericsson and felipe nasr completing both practice sessions . following the initial court ruling , team principal monisha kaltenborn said that changing drivers hours before a grand prix could be dangerous . `` what we can not do is jeopardize the safety of our team , or any other driver on the track , by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers , '' she said , formula1.com reported . brazilian nasr was the highest placed of the two finishing 11th while swede marcus ericsson was 15th . elsewhere there was also a uncertain start for mclaren who finished way down the pecking order . jenson button was 13th , almost four seconds off the pace for the cnn-sponsored team while teammate kevin magnussen , who was deputizing for the absent fernando alonso , was 16th following second practice . local favorite daniel ricciardo completed just nine laps of practice after his red bull suffered engine failure . qualifying for sunday 's race gets underway on saturday .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- before he was jihadi john , he was little john -- a young version of the same mohammed emwazi who authorities say later became the english-speaking face of isis terror . his earlier , innocent image can be seen in video obtained from britain 's channel 4 . it shows a teenage boy in the schoolyard of a west london secondary school . he walks through a sea of fellow students in his zippered sweatshirt over his polo shirt , wearing a backpack and carrying a plastic bottle . at one point , a basketball rolls toward him and he returns it with a deft kick . he looks playful at times as when he skips and lightheartedly pushes two other boys , more serious in others . in other words , he appears to be not much different than any other teenager . but he 's not . the boy in the video is emwazi , his former headmaster at quintin kynaston community academy told cnn . who mohammed emwazi used to be . jo shuter noted that her former student could be shy at times , but overall he was far from a troublemaker and not much out of the ordinary . `` he was bullied a little bit , because he was quiet and reserved , '' shuter said . `` generally , he was fine . there -lrb- were -rrb- no issues with him . there were no problems . '' emwazi became even more focused in his last few years at quintin kynaston community academy , she said . `` he was working hard , he achieved great grades for him , and he went to the university of his choice , '' shuter told cnn this week , referring to london 's westminster university , from which emwazi graduated in 2009 . contrast that perception with that of the masked , deep-voiced , british-accented man who months ago was dubbed jihadi john . there is nothing shy , nothing gentle , nothing playful about him . he starred in grisly isis videos depicting the beheading of hostages , punctuating his horrific actions with taunts at the united states . a man who says he is emwazi 's father told the kuwaiti newspaper al qabas that `` there is nothing that proves '' the man known as jihadi john is his son , mohammed . his kuwait-based lawyer , salem al-hashash , told cnn that the family plans to sue anyone who makes the connection , calling the father jassem emwazi a `` victim of libel . '' yet western authorities have made just such a link . they say that the kuwaiti-born mohammed emwazi went from being a typical `` boy next door '' type growing up in west london to being one of the most high-profile recruits of isis , the islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in syria and iraq . more than a dozen british administrative court documents obtained by cnn indicate that , as far back as 2009 , british security services believed emwazi was part of a radical west london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa . and in late february , two u.s. officials and two u.s. congressional sources confirmed reports in british and other media that emwazi went on to join isis and is the man known as jihadi john .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- at first raymond goldstein thought he 'd received a spam email . the message to the cambridge university physicist was asking for help working out the dynamics of hair , specifically the shape of ponytails . goldstein thought he 'd `` won the nigerian lottery . '' poised to click delete , he scrolled through the message one more time and discovered it was from global consumer goods giant unilever . curiosity piqued , he met with a company representative , and the rest , as they say , is history . assembling a team of balding physicists , goldstein set out to tackle the subject , publishing their research in a peer review journal . it detailed the fluid mechanics of hair , drawing on a rich seam of scientific observation stretching back to da vinci . they even coined a new term : hairodynamics . attention from the scientific community soon followed , and within a year they were collecting a nobel prize . an ig nobel prize , that is . a satirical cousin to the more esteemed swedish award , the ig nobel seeks to highlight research that first makes you laugh , then makes you think . this year marks their 25th anniversary , so what better time to celebrate the ig nobels ' contribution to the research community ? every year thousands vie for the awards -- `` always sourced from the cheapest materials '' according to founder marc abrahams -- held at harvard university . the ceremony is bathos at its finest . winners receive their awards from genuine nobel laureates , but speeches are curtailed by a screaming girl declaring her boredom . each year a cast of professional singers and scientists perform a mini-opera . last year 's was set to mozart and featured a chorus of microbial bacteria . past recipients include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and a study of homosexual necrophilia among mallard ducks -lrb- commended by abrahams for `` its high literary quality '' -rrb- . however , not all winners can have such high scientific kudos . the ig nobels skewered the u.s. government in 2012 , awarding them the prize for literature `` for issuing a report about reports about reports that recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports about reports . '' you can read it here . in 2009 the math prize went to gideon gono , then head of zimbabwe 's reserve bank , for printing a z$ 100 trillion note -lrb- while also printing 1c -rrb- . last year the italian national institute of statistics landed the economics prize for bringing the country out of recession through the use of prostitutes , drugs and smuggling . -lrb- the italian government ended up setting a precedent in europe , with the uk soon including the so-called `` black economy '' in its figures -- national gdp jumped by 5 % that quarter , equivalent to $ 15 billion . -rrb- . as proved by the ig nobels , the line between ridiculous and serious research has always been blurred . this is no better reflected than in dutch-british physicist andre geim . in 2000 geim scooped the ig nobel for biology for using magnets to levitate frogs . ten years later he went on to receive the nobel prize in physics for his `` groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene . '' it is hard to say which is the greater achievement . abrahams is currently touring the uk touting the igs , supported by previous winners such as goldstein and potential candidates like david dunstan , who found fame by conducting a two year study into the homing properties of garden snails -lrb- his modus operandi : throwing them over the garden fence -rrb- . soon abrahams will have to settle down and sift through what he predicts will be about 9,000 entries , before the anniversary ceremony on september 17 . despite his longstanding and much admired pastiche of the nobels , he is still yet to be invited to stockholm for the awards proper . asked if he would attend if offered the opportunity , abrahams demurs , saying `` he would n't want to be a distraction .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a court in ivory coast has sentenced former first lady simone gbagbo to 20 years in prison , the official aip news agency said . gbagbo was convicted monday for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2010 which left more than 3,000 people dead . her husband , former president laurent gbagbo , is in the custody of the hague-based international criminal court awaiting trial over similar charges . the charges stem from the aftermath of gbagbo 's husband 's election defeat in 2010 . laurent gbagbo , then the incumbent president , refused to step down after alassane ouattara was declared the winner of the election . the standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides , leaving thousands dead . in 2012 , the icc issued a warrant against her , alleging that as a member of the president 's inner circle , his wife was an `` indirect co-perpetrator . '' she attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute ouattara supporters , according to the warrant . her husband surrendered to the icc in december of that year , and is currently awaiting trial at the hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths . both have denied the charges . but ivory coast refused to transfer simone gbago , saying it would try her in a domestic court instead . on monday , it did . cnn 's faith karimi contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` a pilot called me last week , concerned he might have marfan syndome , '' a health care provider told me recently at a meeting . `` but if i find he has the disease , do i have to report him to the federal aviation administration ? and if so , should i call him first and tell him that ? would he lose his job ? '' she was totally unsure what to do . several other providers were present , and none of them knew , either . `` you should definitely call him and tell him , '' a health care lawyer , who was present , said . `` you have to provide full disclosure . '' `` but presumably , he knows that you might do so , '' i said . `` and if you told him , he might not come in for the check-up . '' marfan syndrome affects connective tissue and can lead to sudden tears in the aortic artery , causing sudden death . yet if treated , it poses much less risk , though not necessarily zero . the case raised several specific quandaries about what the responsibilities of medical professionals are and should be -- legally or ethically -- in evaluating pilots . the faa requires that pilots self-report any diagnoses . but health care professionals have no obligation to notify anyone . they may know that a pilot has a medical problem that is poorly or not treated and may endanger passengers , but these providers have no obligation to do anything about it . these issues are crucial , given that andreas lubitz deliberately crashed the germanwings flight 9525 , killing 150 passengers . we still do n't know why he committed suicide-murder , but the latest reports indicate he was treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot license . the germanwings disaster has demonstrated that current standards of medical and psychiatric evaluation are inadequate . the faa requires only that pilots fill out a psychological questionnaire , asking whether they have had psychological symptoms . but pilots are not assessed in person by a psychiatrist . such face-to-face assessments can provide crucial information that self-report forms might miss , partly because pilots might answer inaccurately . moreover , the faa requires only that 25 % of pilots have a single random drug screen per year . pilots may pass drug tests in january and realize that the odds of undergoing subsequent tests that year are nil . they may hence use more alcohol and recreational drugs . we need to consider changing current policies . some alterations are relatively easy . the faa should consider requiring far more drug testing -- for all pilots , perhaps every few days . other possible reforms pose difficult ethical dilemmas , and thus need broad , careful discussion -- e.g. , what role providers should play and how much privacy pilots should have . medical exams and records over time can indicate key problems that a single visit to an faa doctor may miss . but requiring more information from pilots diminishes their rights to privacy . indeed , such rights impeded investigators from knowing initially the reason lubitz took a six-month leave and the nature of his medical condition . physicians have to break patient confidentiality when third parties may be endangered . the legal precedent for breaking patient confidentiality in this way is the so-called tarasoff case , in which a young patient told his psychologist at the university of california at berkeley that he wanted to kill his girlfriend , tatiana tarasoff . the psychologist alerted the campus police , though not the city police or tarasoff . unfortunately , the patient then killed tarasoff . a court found the psychologist liable . these violations of patient confidentiality make us providers uncomfortable . as a physician , i have had to report patients whom i even suspected might be abusing a child . i remember one patient who came to the emergency room for psychiatric problems mentioning that she sometimes hit her toddler son with the end of an electrical cord , swinging it until the thick part banged him . as i asked more , she began to cry . i felt terrible for her and was unsure how dangerous her actions were , but i erred on the side of protecting the child 's safety and contacted social services . when i told her , she nodded , then whispered thank you . she knew she needed help . still , in germany and several states , providers do not have to break patient confidentiality , even when they think the patient may endanger others . critical dilemmas arise , though , of what threshold should be used concerning which diagnoses and how much their successful treatment should matter . some diagnoses may be treatable and thus permissible if doctors examine the pilot more frequently than once a year . early in the hiv epidemic , for instance , some critics argued that hiv-infected pilots should be barred from flying , since the virus could cause neurological problems . fortunately , the faa decided that evidence of actual neurological deficits -- not infection alone -- should ground these employees . physicians arguably should consider reporting pilots who have , for instance , epilepsy , manic-depression or diabetes that leads to coma if these conditions are not well controlled with medications . yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment . the faa could require that pilots seek treatment in order to fly , but some pilots may still simply cover up problems . ideally , the clinician should be able to talk with the pilot about the need not to fly and arrange a leave for a few months to improve treatment . good employee assistance programs and trust are also needed . in addition , we need research to find how much physician reporting would reduce risks or lead pilots to camouflage problems . questions still arise of whether even the suspicion of a problem that could impede function should warrant reporting . an individual may seem fine weeks or even days before becoming seriously depressed . careful , transparent discussion , involving medical experts , pilots , policymakers and others , to establish policies with clearly established cutoffs are thus vital . unfortunately , suicides , for instance , are impossible to predict . but much can be done to improve the current system .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the murder earlier this month of 27-year-old farkhunda at the hands of a mob that beat her to death , burned her body and tossed her into a river shocked afghanistan , a country in which unspeakable things often hit the headlines . the young woman from kabul was falsely accused of burning pages in the holy quran . what followed was the horror of mob rule , all captured on video while bystanders looked on . soon after the incident , the images of her brutal slaying went viral on social media , noted afghanistan 's tolo news . and this time , the outrage led afghans to the streets , with assistance from facebook and other social media . these platforms have served both to disseminate the images of her savage beating and murder and as a means for convening those who are mobilizing and organizing to protest her killing . last week , crowds chanted for days , calling for justice for farkhunda and `` death for her killers . '' and , tolo news reported , protests were held in different parts of the country , calling for the `` ultimate penalty to the perpetrators . '' indeed , technology and connectedness have played a role in changing the old narratives in afghanistan , as farkhunda 's killing shows . not only was her murder captured and shared online , but some of those men arrested for her killing were found to have confessed via social media posts . and now a country 's anguish is shared in those same online and virtual neighborhoods . some afghan civil society leaders see the protests that have resulted as yet another sign of an evolving afghanistan -- a nation whose recently elected leaders , now sharing a unity government , visited washington , d.c. , in an effort to turn the page on the past . `` when we are talking about this case , what is it showing us ? first of all , when we are talking about women 's rights , we see that we have succeeded ; people will not tolerate what they tolerated a decade ago , '' said nargis nehan , founder and executive director of equality for peace and democracy , a non-governmental organization created to promote `` a culture of peace , tolerance , transparency and accountability . '' she was speaking last tuesday at a roundtable at georgetown university 's institute for women , peace and security , organized around the visit by afghan president ashraf ghani and chief executive abdullah abdullah . `` if this was the afghanistan of a decade before and this would have happened , a small group of afghan women would have come to the streets to be seeking justice . today we have men seeking justice . '' nehan explained that the younger generation , a progressive generation , wants to have a peaceful afghanistan . `` but at the same time , we have conservatives who have been power-holders for many decades in afghanistan and they do n't want to see that . change always has a cost and unfortunately in this case we see that a very innocent girl like farkhunda has paid that . '' nehan and other leaders from afghanistan could be seen checking facebook frequently for updates on what was happening on the streets of their capital . what they found was an online community sustaining the strong sense of injustice over farkhunda 's killing that prompted the afghan president to announce , even before he left for the united states , a fact-finding commission to investigate her murder . yet some afghan leaders worried that the brutality of this murder marked another troubling turning point in a country wrestling with a great many transitions -- economic , security and political -- all at once . `` it never -lrb- before -rrb- happened to women at this level ; this was really one of the shocking acts of violence publicly within the capital , '' said sima samar , head of the afghan human rights commission , at the georgetown panel . `` it is not far from the palace , less than one kilometer . '' `` my personal concern is that if we do not manage the case properly , it might be used against us and against women 's rights in the country , '' samar added . women have gained a great deal in the roughly 13 years since the taliban was ousted from power . today , 3 million girls attend school . women serve in the country 's security forces -- albeit in very small numbers . they sit in parliament and work as entrepreneurs , teachers and civil society advocates . still , violence against women remains rampant and widespread . the practice of child marriage is outlawed but still common in some parts of the country . and security and the economy are still major challenges , particularly in the more remote provinces of the country untouched by the modernization gripping the nation 's more urban centers . indeed , samar and other human rights advocates and civil society leaders who have played a role in post-taliban afghanistan say they are determined that farkhunda 's death will not be in vain . they say they will continue to fight to keep her case in the spotlight and to see justice served . their commitment to seeking public justice for a public horror may well be one of the most powerful signals yet of an afghanistan that is indeed a very different nation than it was only a decade ago .

'' since the proceedings , the family had noted some similarities between gaye 's `` ai n't that peculiar '' and williams ' `` happy , '' though the family has confirmed in the open letter that they `` have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning ` happy . ' '' read the full open letter from marvin gaye 's children below : . an open letter from the children of marvin gaye 3/18/15 . we want to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the outpouring of love and support we have received from all of our father 's fans and friends , as well as artists and industry folks who contacted us surrounding the recent events concerning his song , `` got to give it up . '' your kindness and encouragement gave us incredible strength and perseverance . we are so incredibly grateful for your support as well as the hard work and dedication of our amazing legal team and experts . we thank you all . we especially want to thank our mom jan for her belief in what we were doing all along , and for her never ending support . we will celebrate what would have been our dad 's 76th birthday next month , and though we miss him every day -- just like the many thousands of well-wishers who have expressed their heartfelt goodwill - it is through his music that we find our compass and our paths moving forward . we are his children , but we too are his fans and we hold his music dear . it is in that spirit and on behalf of all those who dad always considered an extended family , his fans , we take this opportunity to set the record straight on a few misconceptions echoing through some news and social media platforms about our intentions , our plans , and the so-called ` larger ' ramifications of this case within the music industry . originally released in 1977 , `` got to give it up '' became one of our dad 's most cherished hits , still a favorite at backyard barbecues , weddings , parties , on the radio , or on your ipod . as oprah said , it is one of her `` favorite party songs of all time . '' the comments on social media , emails and calls we received after the verdict affirmed for us that the song continues to touch in even deeper ways , becoming part of the soundtrack to so many lives . `` got to give it up '' is also recognized by billboard magazine as the fourth biggest single of the 30 charting hits our dad created during his extraordinary career . it has been nearly 38 years since its initial release : tastes change , trends evolve , but we should all be able to agree that it 's a testament to the enduring power of `` got to give it up '' that we have arrived at this juncture with mr. thicke and mr. williams , at all . the fact that they have openly acknowledged their respect and admiration for the song is public knowledge , and further proof of its resonance with an entirely new generation of music fans . however , most songwriting begins with an organic approach ; a songwriter brings his or her influences to the table and then works creatively from a blank slate in the crafting of their song to ensure originality and the integrity of their creation . if mr. thicke and mr. williams had tried to create a new song and coincidentally infused `` got to give it up '' into their work , instead of deliberately undertaking to `` write a song with the same groove , '' we would probably be having a different conversation . like most artists , they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage ; a simple procedure usually arranged in advance of the song 's release . this did not happen . we would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work . this also did not happen . instead of licensing our father 's song and giving him the appropriate songwriter credit , robin thicke and pharrell williams released `` blurred lines '' and then filed a pre-emptive lawsuit against us , forcing us into court . they sought to quickly affirm that their song was `` starkly different , '' than `` got to give it up . '' the judge denied their motion for summary judgement , and a jury was charged with determining the `` extrinsic and intrinsic similarities '' of the songs . the jury has spoken . we wanted to also make clear that the jury was not permitted to listen to the actual sound recording of `` got to give it up . '' our dad 's powerful vocal performance of his own song along with unique background sounds were eliminated from the trial , and the copyright infringement was based entirely on the similarity of the basic musical compositions , not on `` style , '' or `` feel , '' or `` era , '' or `` genre . '' his song is so iconic that its basic composition stood strong . we feel this further amplifies the soundness of the verdict . like all music fans , we have an added appreciation for songs that touch us in mysterious ways . mr. thicke and mr. williams certainly have a right to be inspired by `` got to give it up '' but as the jury ruled , they did not have the right to use it without permission as a blueprint for a track they were constructing . great artists like our dad intentionally build their music to last , but we as the caretakers of such treasures , have an obligation to be vigilant about preserving the integrity of the music so that future generations understand its origins and feel its effect as the artist intended , and to assure that it retains its value . we feel as many do that , our father , marvin gaye , is an artist for the ages . but whether we 're talking about a work created 50 years ago or a work created 50 years from now -- protecting the legacy of original artistry is not a personal obligation , but a universal commitment in support of enduring creative achievement , encouraging future artists to also aim for new ground and their own legacies . that is what copyright laws help us do ; they give people the incentive to write original songs and then help protect those songs . our dad spent his life writing music - that is his legacy to us all - he wrote from his heart and was a brilliant songwriter , arranger , producer and one-of-a-kind vocalist . if he were alive today , we feel he would embrace the technology available to artists and the diverse music choices and spaces accessible to fans who can stream a song at a moment 's notice . but we also know he would be vigilant about safeguarding the artist 's rights ; a sacred devotion to not only the artist , but key in encouraging and supporting innovation . he also gave credit where credit is due . howard king , the attorney for mr. thicke and mr. williams stated after the verdict : `` we owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict does n't stand . my clients know they wrote the song ` blurred lines ' from their heart and souls and no other source . '' we never for a minute suggested that mr. thicke and mr. williams ' hearts were n't in it . but a jury of eight men and women have ruled that the source for `` blurred lines '' was the song `` got to give it up , '' a song our dad wrote from his heart , and delivered to the world with pure joy . with the digital age upon us , the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist . it is our wish that our dad 's legacy , and all great music , past , present , and future , be enjoyed and protected , with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued . and finally , we want to put to rest any rumors that we are contemplating claims against pharrell williams for his song , `` happy . '' this is 100 % false . we have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning `` happy . '' love and respect , . nona , frankie , and marvin iii . copyright © 2015 rolling stone .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as an offensive guard for the baltimore ravens , john urschel already has a lot on his plate . he regularly goes head to head with the top defensive players in the nfl and does his best to keep quarterback joe flacco out of harm 's way . but besides his endeavors on the field , urschel also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with nfl players : mathematical research . not content with the respect of the locker room , he also seeks the esteem of top mathematicians around the globe . `` i have a bachelor 's and master 's in mathematics , all with a 4.0 , and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals , '' urschel wrote in a recent article for the players ' tribune . his latest contribution to the mathematical realm was a paper for the journal of computational mathematics with the impressively esoteric title , `` a cascadic multigrid algorithm for computing the fiedler vector of graph laplacians . '' urschel , 23 , makes no effort to hide his unusual combination of talents : his official twitter handle is @mathmeetsfball . as word of his double life spread on social media in recent days , users responded with fascination and admiration . `` you are my goddamn hero -lrb- football fan and aspiring complex/functional analyst here -rrb- , '' tweeted roy cardenas , who describes himself as a math ph.d. student . but urschel acknowledges that he has faced questions from nfl officials , journalists , fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has `` a bright career ahead of me in mathematics . '' after every season , he says in the players ' tribune article , his mother tries to discourage him from continuing to play football . the penn state graduate says the reason he keeps going is n't for the money -lrb- he drives a used nissan versa and lives on less than $ 25,000 a year -rrb- or `` for some social status associated with being an elite athlete . '' it 's simpler than that . `` i play because i love the game . i love hitting people , '' he writes . `` there 's a rush you get when you go out on the field , lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you . '' `` this is a feeling i 'm -lrb- for lack of a better word -rrb- addicted to , and i 'm hard-pressed to find anywhere else , '' he explains . he shared his thoughts after san francisco 49ers linebacker chris borland announced last week that he was retiring from professional football at age 24 because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma . urschel says he envies borland but does n't feel able to quit . `` when i go too long without physical contact i 'm not a pleasant person to be around , '' he writes . `` this is why , every offseason , i train in kickboxing and wrestling in addition to my lifting , running and position-specific drill work . '' and as if two areas of overachievement were n't enough , there is one other thing at which urschel excels . `` i 'm also an avid chess player , '' he says . `` and i have aspirations of eventually being a titled player one day .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- an ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between vikings and the islamic world , more than a century after its discovery . the finger ring found in a 9th century swedish grave is inscribed with arabic kufic writing . the letters appear to read `` al_llh , researchers say , which they interpret as meaning `` for/to -lrb- the approval of -rrb- allah . '' in a paper published in the journal scanning , the researchers say it is the only ring with an arabic inscription ever found at a scandinavian archaeological site . the object was originally discovered during a late 19th century grave excavation in the town of birka , on björkö island , about 19 miles -lrb- 30 kilometers -rrb- from stockholm . birka was a key trading center during the viking age and made a unesco world heritage site in 1993 . the ring is part of the swedish history museum 's collection , originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst , bearing the inscription `` allah . '' researchers led by stockholm university biophysicist sebastian wärmländer say they used `` scanning electron microscopy -lrb- sem -rrb- with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy -lrb- eds -rrb- to analyze the ring 's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the `` amethyst '' was colored glass . `` for the stone , we must remember that even though colored glass might today be perceived as a ` fake ' material of lower value , this was not necessarily so in the past , '' the team cautioned . `` even though glass production began around 5,000 years ago in the levant it was still an exotic material in viking age scandinavia . '' more significantly , the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks . `` together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken : if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away , also the file markings would be gone . but the metal surface displays no wear , and as the original file marks are still in place , this ring has never been much used . '' the team , therefore , believes the ring was passed from an arabic silversmith to the woman , with few or any other owners in between . while imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from afghanistan -- they were `` usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes '' researchers said . the owner of the ring was found wearing traditional scandinavian clothing , but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave . `` it is not impossible that the woman herself , or someone close to her , might have visited -- or even originate from -- the caliphate -lrb- which then stretched from tunisia to the borders of india -rrb- or its surrounding regions , '' they said . while travel between the islamic caliphate and the viking world was recorded in ancient texts , tales of such journeys often included references to `` giants and dragons '' making it hard to tell fact from fiction , the researchers said . `` the importance of the studied birka ring is that it most eloquently corroborates ancient tales about direct contacts between viking age scandinavia and the islamic world . such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods , culture , ideas , and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in-between , '' they concluded . modern relationship . this new evidence of ancient ties between the vikings and the caliphate comes at a time when sweden 's relationship with the modern islamic world seems to be problematic . the country 's foreign minister , margot wallstrom , has recently come under scrutiny after criticizing human rights in saudi arabia . in january , she tweeted that the flogging of blogger raif badawi was `` a cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression , '' which needed to be stopped . saudi arabia blocked wallstrom from giving a speech to the arab league in cairo on march 9 , in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women . sweden subsequently announced that it would not renew its memorandum of understanding with saudi arabia on military cooperation -- and in turn saudi arabia and the united arab emirates withdrew their ambassadors to sweden . the united arab emirates said it had summoned sweden 's ambassador to protest `` the abusive remarks by the foreign minister of sweden , margot wallstrom , against saudi arabia .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` in order to attain the impossible , one must attempt the absurd , '' wrote miguel de cervantes , the shakespeare of spain . and the quest to find his remains has sometimes seemed both , even -lrb- dare one say it -rrb- quixotic in a time of recession . but forensic scientists have persevered , and appear to have triumphed . almost 400 years after cervantes ' death , a team led by francisco etxeberria announced tuesday that they were confident they had found cervantes ' coffin in the crypt of the convent of the barefoot trinitarians in the barrio de las letras -lrb- literary quarter -rrb- in madrid . historical records indicated cervantes had been buried there , but the convent had been substantially rebuilt since . -lrb- etxeberria , incidentally , performed the autopsy on former chilean president gen. salvador allende , confirming he had committed suicide . -rrb- . at a news conference in madrid on tuesday , etxeberria said that while there was no mathematical proof or dna test available to completely verify the findings , there were `` many coincidences and no discrepancies '' in the examination of `` osario 32 , '' a common grave in the crypt that contained the remains of 16 people . `` we have cervantes , represented in some form in this group of bones that are unfortunately very degraded and very fragmented , '' etxeberria told national television . the search for cervantes ' coffin -- using radar -- began last year , funded by the madrid city council . it first mapped more than 30 burial cavities in the walls and nearly 5 meters beneath the floor of the church . mass spectrometry dated fragments of wood and cloth found in these cavities to the 17th century , an encouraging but far from conclusive development . one crumbling coffin found in january had the initials `` m c '' hammered in nail heads , along with a jumble of skeletal remains . even then exteberria urged caution , but further research has narrowed the odds . the forensic team had been hoping that some of those remains would positively identify cervantes , who suffered gunshot wounds in the chest and left hand at the battle of lepanto in 1571 . but they are not in sufficiently good shape , and some of the remains found may be of cervantes ' wife , catalina de salazar . nor will dna analysis be much help , for there are no known descendants of cervantes . catalina was not cervantes ' first partner . as a teenager he ran away from home with a barmaid , josefina de perez , before enlisting with the spanish navy . it was only in the 1580s that he started to write , publishing `` la galatea '' in 1585 and his most famous work , `` don quixote , '' in 1605 -- or to give its full title , `` the adventures of the ingenious nobleman don quixote of la mancha . '' but `` don quixote '' would hardly be noticed in cervantes ' lifetime , and he was almost penniless when he died , having joined the third order of st. francis in his declining years . he knew he was dying when he wrote in the prologue of a posthumously published novel , `` perhaps the time may come when i mend again this broken thread and say what words fail me here and what needed to be said . farewell , waggish jokes ; farewell , wittiness ; farewell , merry friends , for i am dying and longing soon to see you , happy in the life to come . '' cervantes was buried on april 23,1616 -- in the same week william shakespeare died . there are now plans to reinter cervantes at the convent and build a new entrance to the crypt in time for the 400th anniversary of cervantes ' death next year . tyler fisher , a lecturer in hispanic studies at royal holloway college in london , says that such exhumations `` ignite public attention , inspire re-readings , and invest an all-but-forgotten corner of the city with a renewed , imaginative depth . '' cervantes might enjoy all the attention . many literary critics say he was not aware of his own genius . john ormsby , a scholar and translator of cervantes ' work in the 19th century , wrote of `` don quixote , '' `` never was a great work so neglected by its author . '' cnn 's helena cavendish de moura contributed to this report .
sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 special operations forces members from the al anad airbase in yemen due to that country 's deteriorating security situation , sources in the region familiar with the situation told cnn . those being evacuated are the last american troops stationed in the arab nation , which is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , the terrorist group also known as aqap . the united states closed its embassy in sanaa last month , after houthi rebels took over the yemeni capital . and hundreds of al qaeda members escaped two yemeni prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions . for years , the u.s. military has worked closely with yemen 's government to go after aqap , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al qaeda figure anwar al-awlaki . and u.s. president barack obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign . `` yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , '' obama said in january , promoting the policy of `` partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government '' as the best approach in a bad situation . `` the alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , '' the president said . but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by yemen 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace . these include the rise of the houthis , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president abdu rabu mansour hadi and the presence of not only al qaeda fighters but other militants . on friday , for instance , isis purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in sanaa what , if true , would mark that group 's first large-scale attack in yemen . the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried isis proclamations , but could n't be immediately authenticated by cnn . those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to yemen 's state-run saba news agency . while isis and al qaeda are both sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of islam and violent opposition to the west , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon . in fact , aqap strongly rebuked isis in a video released in november , characterizing its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's declaration of an islamic caliphate as illegitimate . more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the islamic state violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there . with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the west -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over . meanwhile , the main players for control of yemen 's government -- those siding with hadi , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the houthis , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds . just two days ago , a yemeni jet commanded by the capital 's houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden . no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides . the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemeni military forces -- some under the houthis , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , said aden gov. abdulaziz hobtour . at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to hobtour . hadi took to the airwaves of adan tv , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest . he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the saudi capital of riyadh , condemning the aden strike and urging yemeni troops to refuse orders from houthi officials . hadi tied the houthis to iran , which he was said supported the `` coup '' that led to his departure from aden . `` the iranian agenda of the houthis will not last , '' he said . needless to say , the houthis are n't convinced . mohammed al bukhaiti , a top member of the houthi political council , said hadi 's speech wo n't help yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power . `` we blame hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved yemen 's ongoing crises , '' al bukhaiti said . `` hadi will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow .

kano , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- troops from niger and chad discovered a mass grave with more than 90 decomposed bodies near a northern nigerian town recently retaken from the islamic militant group boko haram , security sources from both countries said friday . the corpses , some of them beheaded , were found in a shallow mass grave under a bridge just outside the nigerian town of damasak , near the border with niger , the sources said . troops from niger and chad took back the town from boko haram last week during a joint operation , the security sources said . damasak is in borno , one of several northern states inhabited by the islamist militant group . borno is in the northeast corner of nigeria and borders niger , chad and cameroon . boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since 2009 , attacking police , schools , churches , mosques and civilians . it has kidnapped students , including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in april 2014 and remain missing . the group , its naming meaning `` western education is forbidden , '' has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria . journalist aminu abubakar reported from kano , nigeria . cnn 's melissa gray wrote and reported from atlanta .
aberdeenshire , scotland -lrb- cnn -rrb- in an exclusive interview ahead of his u.s. tour -- and ahead of his 10-year wedding anniversary -- prince charles paid tribute to the `` brilliant '' way his wife , camilla , duchess of cornwall , has taken on the `` real , real challenge '' of defining her public role . `` it 's always marvelous to have somebody who , you know , you feel understands and wants to encourage . although she certainly pokes fun if i get too serious about things . and all that helps , '' prince charles told cnn . the couple first visited the u.s. together as newlyweds in 2005 , and camilla was confronted by hardcore princess diana fans with abusive placards . polls at the time found that between 57 % and 73 % of brits opposed charles ' new wife being known as queen . if you go back even further , to 1997 , the year diana died , an ipsos mori poll put it at 86 % . reporter 's notebook : interviewing the royal couple . but there 's been a change in sentiment since they married . a new poll conducted by comres for cnn found that only 35 % now oppose camilla being known as queen . nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago . this coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing camilla to be herself . when she appears in public , she 's either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with . prince charles praised how his wife has handled herself . `` she 's done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis , which of course runs in her family , '' he said , noting that camilla 's mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease . he also points to other issues camilla is associated with , including literacy and preventing sexual violence . the duchess of cornwall , by sticking to what she knows and cares about , is able to connect with the people she meets , which does n't always come across on camera . when charles and camilla married in 2005 , there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of diana , who was expected to be queen herself . with this in mind , royal aides announced that camilla would not use the title of queen when charles becomes king . instead she would be known as princess consort . that still stands , although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of queen .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the fury of tropical cyclone pam , one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall , has moved on , but the misery it left behind in the islands of vanuatu is just starting to become apparent . aid workers described scenes of extensive devastation in the capital , port vila , and expressed fears of even more destruction farther afield . thousands were in need of shelter , food and water , the red cross said sunday . `` homes have been lost , crops are destroyed . the damage is enormous , and people need our help , '' said aurelia balpe , head of the red cross in the pacific . `` yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage .

'' most buildings in the capital were destroyed or damaged , he told cnn on sunday . many roads were blocked by fallen trees or power lines . the main objective now is to get disaster response teams into vanuatu and kick-start the humanitarian operation , sune gudnitz , regional head for the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs , told cnn from fiji , about 600 miles away . his aid agency has had word of much destruction on efate , the island where port vila is located , and from the southern island of tanna , he said . only a little information has so far trickled out from beyond the capital , but gudnitz said he fears the worst . `` unfortunately , the more that comes out , the worse it looks , '' he said . vanuatu president baldwin lonsdale , who was at a u.n. conference on disaster risk reduction in japan on saturday , issued an appeal to the global community to help his shattered nation . vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency , opening the door for other countries to help . vanuatu 's remote location adds to the challenges the international response faces . port vila is more than 1,770 kilometers -lrb- 1,100 miles -rrb- northeast of brisbane on australia 's east coast , and some 2,200 kilometers -lrb- 1,367 miles -rrb- north of auckland , the closest city in new zealand . reaching the more isolated communities will also take time . vanuatu 's archipelago -- comprising 83 small islands , about 65 of them inhabited -- is roughly 850 kilometers -lrb- 528 miles -rrb- long . many of the people are subsistence farmers , said cnn 's bill weir , who visited vanuatu recently . he recalled talking to a resident who built the first indoor bathroom on his island and sought advice on where to find a toilet paper dispenser . `` it 's setting them back years , '' weir said of the storm . people away from the capital live much as their ancestors did generations ago . homes are built of weak materials , including straw and corrugated steel , that stood little chance against pam 's raging winds . `` when you 've got a category 5 cyclone that essentially just sat here for 24 hours -- where do you go when you have a storm that powerful ? '' perry of care international said . `` it 's very terrifying to think about what people have been through . '' while international teams are finding a way in , it will be up to humanitarian agency staffers on the ground and the local communities themselves to do what they can to get by amid the wreckage . aid workers said the most immediate challenge is to get clean water to people . many people will be spending another night in emergency shelters . track the storm . pam is the south pacific 's second strongest cyclone since record-keeping began in 1970 . and it 's the strongest of any type since super typhoon haiyan smashed into the philippines in 2013 , killing more than 6,000 people . cnn 's ralph ellis , ben brumfield and laura smith-spark contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a severe solar storm created a stunning display of light in the night sky over parts of the united states , europe , australia and new zealand early wednesday morning , spotted by those lucky enough to be awake in the wee hours . called aurora borealis in the northern hemisphere and aurora australis in the southern hemisphere , the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived tuesday about 10 a.m. et -lrb- 1 a.m. wednesday in sydney -rrb- . both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the earth , said cnn meteorologist todd borek . `` when these particles bombard the earth 's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere , the collision often creates brilliant colors , '' borek said . `` most of the time , auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint , which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on earth . '' share your photos of the aurora with ireport . the stronger the storm , the farther south it can be seen , said borek . and this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful , reaching as a high as a g4 on a scale from 1 to 5 tuesday night , according to noaa 's space weather prediction center . the storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours , and noaa 's latest reports say it 's down to a g1 . though the storm could affect gps technology and power grids , noaa said tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions . the most visible impact as been this stunning light display . if the auroras are seen again tonight , borek said , they wo n't be as pronounced and most likely wo n't reach as far south as tuesday night . people in northern michigan , northern minnesota and maine may be able to spot them , although he warned that clouds from minnesota to montana may impede visibility wednesday night .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- british actress emma watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world : `` do n't let anyone tell you what you can or can not do , or can not achieve . `` just do n't allow it . it 's wrong . it 's so wrong . be what you want to be -- and prove them wrong . '' the emotional harry potter star took to the stage at facebook 's headquarters in london on sunday , march 8 , to talk about gender equality as part of international women 's day celebrations . cnn was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world -- as the 24-year-old un goodwill ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey . emma 's facebook moment . of the dozens gathered at the event , the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike harry potter himself . describing the `` surreal '' moment she gave a speech at u.n. headquarters , later watched by 17 million , watson said : `` gender equality historically has been a woman 's movement . `` and how it 's affecting men has n't been addressed , '' she told moderator greg james . during the hour-long conversation , watson gave the audience a rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism . `` i love having the door opened for me , is n't that just polite ? '' she said . `` but i think the key is , would you then mind me opening the door for you ? '' `` chivalry should be consensual . '' and it 's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too , she added . `` i get disturbed by this idea that men ca n't cry , '' she continued . `` they ca n't express themselves and i think that 's the saddest thing in the world . being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it 's not what makes you a girl . '' when internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress , following her un speech , she said it only made her more determined in her campaign . `` if they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite , '' she added . almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the heforshe campaign , including u.s. president barack obama , and actors joseph gordon-levitt and matt damon . `` i read a letter of support from a 13-year-old boy that was equally as passionate as a ceo , '' said watson , adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night . `` i asked my younger sister : ` what would be the one thing you 'd want from boys in your life ? ' she said : ' i just want them to play with us . ' and i think that really translates at every level . we just want to be included . '' watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother , jacqueline , who was a `` single working mother and type one diabetic . '' `` she wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good , '' said watson , adding : `` she was actually thrilled when i got my first detention ... i think i failed a latin exam . '' answering questions submitted via facebook , watson said the recent lack of female representation at the academy awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over . `` why are women not directing their own stories ? '' she said . `` the human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly . and at the moment one of its wings is clipped , '' said watson , paraphrasing famous american feminist , gloria steinem . when asked what things we can all do to affect change , the actress said it was n't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones . `` it 's everyday , it 's individual , it 's on a case by case basis , '' she said . `` whether it 's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue . '' in the audience , a man wearing a hogwarts jumper asked watson whether women should be paid the same as men , when they are more likely to take maternity leave . she answered : `` i do n't think in the grand scheme of things -lsb- maternity leave -rsb- is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field . `` i think men should be equal partners in raising children .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the aircraft carrier uss ranger , which saw action in the vietnam war and operation desert storm and had appearances in the movies `` top gun '' and `` star trek iv , '' is on its final journey , a five-month cruise at the end of a tow cable from bremerton , washington , to a scrapyard in texas . the 56,300-ton warship , which was launched in 1956 , was decommissioned in 1993 but kept in storage for possible reactivation until march 2004 when it was stricken from the naval vessel register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it and turn it into a museum . but attempts by groups in long beach , california , and fairview , oregon , to do so came up short of meeting u.s. government requirements for donation . the long beach group called itself top gun super carrier in reference to the ranger 's role in the 1986 tom cruise movie . the carrier was used for interior shots in the film , which also featured appearances by the carriers uss carl vinson and uss enterprise , according to internet movie database . in december , the navy paid international shipbreaking of brownsville , texas , a penny to take the carrier off its hands . the shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap . the ranger , which left bremerton on thursday , follows two of its predecessors in the forrestal class of carriers -- the forrestal and the saratoga -- to scrapyards in brownsville . another carrier , the uss constellation , part of the kitty hawk class , was towed to brownsville last year . like the ranger , the constellation was stored in washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of south america , as it would not fit through the panama canal . the ranger 's final journey is expected to take four to five months , the navy said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the sounds recorded on one of the `` black boxes '' recovered from downed germanwings flight 9525 firms up investigators ' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane . `` for god 's sake , open the door ! '' capt. patrick sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door , pleading with the co-pilot . thirteen minutes later , the plane slammed into the french alps . the audio from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has not been released , but the german newspaper bild published sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording . cnn translated bild 's report -- which the newspaper says is based on the 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder -- but can not independently verify the information . france 's accident investigation agency , bea , told cnn that the agency is `` dismayed '' by the voice recording leak to bild . martine del bono , a spokeswoman for the agency , said the leak could not have come from a bea agent . she said the agency considers the report mere `` voyeurism . '' according to bild 's report , sondenheimer told co-pilot andreas lubitz that he did n't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff . lubitz tells him he can go anytime . lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot of flight 9525 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains , french authorities have said . the flight took off 20 minutes late . after reaching cruising altitude , sondenheimer asked lubitz to prepare the landing . once that 's finished , lubitz again tells the captain he `` can go anytime . '' there is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says , `` you can take over . '' at 10:29 a.m. , air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend . three minutes later , air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit , warning of the `` sink rate , '' bild reported . next comes the banging . sondenheimer begs lubitz to let him in . passengers then begin to scream , according to the transcript obtained by bild . another three minutes pass . a loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters -lrb- almost 23,000 feet -rrb- . a minute and half later and 2,000 meters -lrb- about 6,500 feet -rrb- lower to the ground , an alarm says `` terrain -- pull up ! '' `` open the damn door ! '' the pilot says . it 's 10:38 , and the plane is at 4,000 meters -lrb- about 13,000 feet -rrb- . lubitz 's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder , according to bild 's report . two minutes later , investigators think they hear the plane 's right wing scrape a mountaintop . screams can be heard one final time . cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations . they 're never officially released , according to cnn aviation reporter richard quest . quest called it `` unbelievable '' that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner . communications between air traffic control and a plane 's cockpit can be downloaded privately , but that 's less common in europe than it is in the united states . an edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident . although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing . that device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight . jean pierre michel , lead investigator for the french inquiry , said on saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point . but french authorities have said that lubitz appeared to have crashed germanwings flight 9525 deliberately into the alps on tuesday as it flew from barcelona , spain , toward dusseldorf , germany , with 150 people on board . much attention has focused on lubitz 's state of mind since then , with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues . lubitz , 27 , passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a german aviation source told cnn . an official with lufthansa , which owns germanwings , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health . the official also said that the company was never given any indication lubitz was depressed , and that if he went to a doctor on his own , he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly . a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , `` concerning a diagnosis . '' but the university clinic said it had not treated lubitz for depression . the speculation about lubitz ' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his dusseldorf apartment . the note , which was `` slashed , '' said lubitz was not able to do his job , city prosecutor christoph kumpa said friday . the fact that investigators found `` ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , '' prosecutors said . germanwings corroborated that assertion , saying it had never received a sick note from lubitz . a handful of publications , citing unnamed sources , have reported that lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies . cnn has not been able to confirm these reports . lubitz suffered from `` generalized anxiety disorder , '' and from severe depression in the past , le parisien newspaper reported sunday , citing sources close to the investigation . in 2010 , lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication , the paper said . he was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters , but it 's unclear when that happened , according to le parisien . the newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes , which forbade him from working from march 16 to march 29 . the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer . a subsequent report from the times on saturday , citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , said lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk . however , an official with lufthansa , said that if lubitz had vision problems , they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination . authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic , according to the times . citing an unidentified senior investigator , german newspaper die welt said that lubitz suffered from a severe `` psychosomatic illness '' and that german police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition . lubitz suffered from a `` severe subjective burnout syndrome '' and from severe depression , the source told the newspaper . news reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment . investigators are expected to question his relatives , friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside . lubitz had a girlfriend , a teacher at a school in dusseldorf not far from his apartment , according to german media . who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ? dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town , digne-les-bains , france . most of the people on the plane were from germany and spain . relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site , in the village of le vernet . flowers have been laid there , in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the french alps . the mayor of one local community said he had seen lubitz 's father on thursday evening , describing him as `` a man in deep distress . '' `` we get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders , '' bernard bartolini , the mayor of prads-haute-bleone , said saturday . `` i can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken , '' bartolini said . `` he had so much emotion in him .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton is pressing the reset button -- yet again . she 's quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the state department . clinton 's twitter account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care , college affordability , civil rights and jobs -- issues she hopes will help mobilize president barack obama 's democratic coalition and pave her way to the presidency . meanwhile , her nascent operation is leaking details of future staffers in an unmistakeable message to democrats spooked by the email flap that the campaign-in-waiting will become an official effort , possibly as soon as next month . a cnn/orc international poll out on wednesday found that she 's miles ahead of any potential democratic challenger and would beat all potential republican candidates by at least 10 points . despite fretting among some democrats who worried that the party 's best -- and perhaps only -- viable democratic candidate appeared to be in trouble , early signs suggest clinton is doing what the clintons do best : mounting a comeback . `` the interest in the story is collapsing onto itself . i do n't see an organic clamoring for more information , '' said a longtime clinton ally who did n't want to speak for a campaign that has n't yet been announced . this person , who has spent time in iowa , argued that outside the community of political reporters and consultants in washington and new york who fixated on the story , the people who really count -- voters -- were n't really interested . `` people very much want to know what the campaign is going to be about ... what is she going to do about student loan costs , for example ? '' tharon johnson , a democratic strategist who was southern regional director of obama 's re-election campaign in 2012 , agreed . `` if and when hillary clinton decides to run , she will have to address this issue , but i believe the american people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them , '' he said . of course , clinton still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated , no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008 . but the cnn poll revealed that those critical of clinton 's role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53 % . a slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with clinton 's slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles . perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1 % of respondents had never heard of clinton . that supports the idea expressed by some democrats that clinton may be the most vetted figure in public life . there are people who will never vote for her and those who are dedicated to her quest to be the first female president , but very few whose minds may not be made up . a less well-known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of hyper-covered flap clinton was . but republicans believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving , as it touches on a narrative that the clintons are secretive , resistant to transparency and often blur the rules . there are also other problems -- including the question of foreign funds sent to the clinton foundation and hillary clinton 's whopper speaking fees -- that republicans believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely democratic nominee 's character . then there are the foreign policy questions , including a now damaging photo op in which clinton offered a `` reset '' button to russia only for the country to revert to a cold war-esque posture . she was also a central player in obama 's foreign policy , which often appears to be overtaken by the middle east 's swift descent into chaos . `` for everything that i can see , the democrats have put all of their eggs in one basket here , '' said sean spicer , communications director of the republican national committee . `` that is more of a downfall in the general election than in the primary . '' spicer argued that even with younger voters , who do not remember the clinton years , the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals . though clinton is the prohibitive democratic front-runner , her support in the party is not universal . but where she faces resistance , it is more likely to be over policy than emails , as grass-roots democrats are suspicious over her centrist , pro-business and hawkish foreign policy leanings . `` as this discussion was playing out inside the beltway , our members were focused on issues , '' said anna galland , executive director of moveon.org , which wants elizabeth warren to challenge clinton for the democratic nomination . galland said activists were preoccupied with the preservation of the social safety net , constraining wall street and those on the `` ragged edge '' of the middle class . similarly , the young voters who flocked to obama in 2008 and who will be crucial to clinton 's hopes of mobilizing an effective democratic coalition in 2016 may also offer clinton a political cushion . this group is hazy over historic references to long ago clinton scandals like filegate , travelgate and even the monica lewinsky episode that led to president bill clinton 's impeachment . `` the media loves a clinton scandal , '' said one democratic source who did n't want to be named because he does n't work for clinton . `` but young people are more likely to know her as secretary of state , and someone who ran for president in 2008 . '' polling bears out the theory . the cnn survey shows clinton 's favorability among voters age 18 to 34 with a 22 point positive differential . but she 's barely in positive territory among voters age 50 to 64 , who are likely to have strong memories of her time as first lady , and is underwater among those 60 or older . another well-connected democrat who did n't want to go on the record criticizing clinton admitted that the email issue did play into gop caricatures about the allegedly `` conspiratorial '' politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state 's early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president . but democratic operatives think that once clinton is actually running , with an infrastructure behind her , and striking messages about the minimum wage , college debt and middle-class economic issues , voters will engage . in many ways , the email furor was a story the media could n't wait to write , so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode , at least in the absence of any evidence that clinton broke the law or made classified information vulnerable . political reporters have pined for weeks for clinton to swing her campaign into action , and her failure to offer a storyline opened a vacuum that was easy for unflattering stories to fill . her slow response breathed new life into a question that only clinton can answer : will her 2016 campaign be as dysfunctional , reactive and distracted as her chaotic and unsuccessful 2008 effort ? but there were a few lessons . it 's clear the clinton machine is not about to morph into a humming , scandal-free effort in the image of barack obama 's first presidential campaign . and clinton 's bitter relationship with political reporters seems as bad as ever . the days when she partied with a state department press corps more preoccupied with policy than politics seem like ancient history . but here also , clinton is trying a reset . her nascent campaign has made it known that she is staffing up her campaign and press operation . john podesta , who is expected to take a leadership role in her campaign , is respected by reporters , as is jennifer palmieri , the outgoing white house communications director expected to take on a similar role for clinton . on tuesday , it emerged that clinton would name brian fallon , who has also good ties with reporters , to be lead press secretary .

'' ptsd can occur after many types of trauma : rape , torture , child abuse , natural disasters and car , plane , and train wrecks , to name a few . according to the ptsd alliance , more than 13 million americans have ptsd and the societal cost is in the billions . women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder . symptoms tend to cluster into three areas : . • reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images , along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking , chills or heart palpitations . • avoiding reminders of the event , including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends , family and everyday activities . • being hyperaroused , easily startled , irritable , angry , or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating . as one might expect , service members are hardest hit . the department of veterans affairs estimates 30 % of all vietnam vets have experienced ptsd . among troops recently deployed to iraq and afghanistan , ptsd can run as high as 20 % in any given year . but why does severe emotional trauma trigger ptsd in some people and not others ? the idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop ptsd is a popular focus of recent research . scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice . the lack of a fear-regulating brain chemical called gastrin-releasing peptide led to greater fear response among the rodents . in another study , mice without a protein necessary to form `` fear memories '' were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces . studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30 % of the differences in response to trauma , with identical twins much more likely to both develop ptsd than fraternal twins . other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences , mental disorders , or addictive tendencies . an unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of ptsd symptoms . prior studies of people diagnosed with ptsd compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role . `` the body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system , '' says baker , discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals . `` the systems all talk to each other . '' the recent study , published in the journal molecular psychiatry , is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 marines taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones . another group of 96 marines was also studied to verify the results . `` under this experimental design , not only can we identify differences between u.s. marines with ptsd and without , but we can go back in time , so to speak , to see if any of the marines who eventually developed ptsd '' showed evidence that it would emerge , says the study 's co-senior author , christopher woelk . `` in this vein , we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively ` causal ' in nature . '' in the blood of marines ultimately diagnosed with ptsd , the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body 's first line of defense -- and interferon , a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action . in addition , this hypervigilant immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma . `` why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less ? is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen ? '' asks baker . instead of pathogens , another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war . `` you could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of ptsd , '' says baker . baker stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded . `` we 're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience , and with more research we 'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments , '' says baker .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- so now we know . the germanwings aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction , according to officials . we all wish it were n't so , and the investigation , instead of looking at possible deficiencies of the plane , will now look to the co-pilot , who -- by all accounts -- showed no signs that this would be his horrific legacy . the irony would be rich , if it were n't so tragic . the locked door , the very mechanism put into place to protect the cockpit from unruly or dangerous passengers -- made more secure in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- was used against a pilot who , for reasons still unknown , left the cockpit . it may be too early to draw conclusive lessons from what has happened , but as this unfolds and before we begin constructing a narrative about the pilot that may be filled with rumors , innuendo and half-truths , there are structural issues to address immediately . first , we have seen that there is a real risk of pilots bringing down planes . we have built no back-up plans into the secure cockpit programs . it might be necessary to devise secure and classified entry access passwords or electronic keys that are available only to both pilots or a pilot and the lead flight attendant . no system of security should rely on a single point of entry and while the post-9 / 11 security planning made sense then , it may have outlived the threat now . second , regardless of pilots ' backgrounds and ideologies , airlines as sophisticated as lufthansa may need to implement more than voluntary stress-relief assessments . the zeitgeist of pilots is very similar to the military : tough , strong , with psychological challenges viewed as `` sissy . '' perhaps airlines will need to guarantee that pilots who seek counseling will not be unjustly punished . and instead of sitting back and waiting for someone to approach counselors , regular and consistent check-ins might be necessary . finally , the `` t '' word . before the news today , the obama administration quickly rejected a notion that this was terrorism . and that may still be accurate . but as someone who has been a part of counterterrorism efforts , i am impressed with the french prosecutor 's honesty in a search for the right words . this is obviously terrorism in the general sense to elicit fear in a general population , but whether it was done for some political or ideological reason -lrb- in the absence of any group taking credit , it does not fit the model of most major airline terror attacks -rrb- we still do not know . and it is n't as if there is a national response that we can expect from germany , such as going to war . still , it clearly is n't just suicide . this is different . if there is some nefarious ideological motivation , this may be one of a few incidents where a `` loner '' is able to create massive , simultaneous deaths . most lone wolf terror is almost always of low consequence . it may be that we are in an era when we do n't have the right words to describe the threats we face from loners with the capacity for mass casualties . as lufthansa ceo carsten spohr said , `` if a person kills himself and also 149 other people , another word should be used -- not suicide . '' and that honest assessment is what we heard today .
los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- even as major airports across the country clamp down on employee screening , a lone wolf could still potentially slip through security , a top airport official said . email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com . patrick gannon , police chief of los angeles international airport , said the 54,000 employees with security badges undergo recurring criminal background checks and random screening . but even that may not be enough . `` i agree that in any airport throughout the united states and here also , there is never a 100 % guarantee that somebody who wanted to do something illegal or wrong could n't make that happen , '' gannon said . only two major airports in the united states -- miami and orlando -- conduct full employee screening by requiring all employees with access to secure areas to pass through a metal detector , a cnn investigation found . other airports like los angeles conduct random screenings . many airports do n't do any screenings at all other than a criminal background check before employees are hired . the crackdown on employee screening comes after the arrest of a delta baggage handler and passenger accused of gun smuggling at atlanta 's hartsfield jackson international airport in december . both atlanta and los angeles have since begun restricting access by closing access doors that lead to the airfield . nevertheless , gannon acknowledged that the potential of a lone wolf committing a crime at the airport worries him . `` it concerns me all the time , '' he said . with so many employees , '' -lsb- t -rsb- here is no way that you are going to have the ability to screen every single person that comes to work in the airport . '' at lax , employees punch in a code and swipe their badge to access the airfield . gannon said about 18 out of approximately 300 access doors have been closed as the airport evaluates employee screening procedures . he said , `` the more you limit the access doors , the more you can focus things like spot checks and screenings and cameras . '' even at miami international airport , gannon said , `` they still ca n't 100 % say that they can keep contraband or any type of item out of their restricted area . '' lauren stover , miami airport security director , agreed that id badges alone `` are not enough -lsb- to -rsb- stop malicious intent . '' `` you can vet employees for basic information on their backgrounds , but it 's not going to prevent them from carrying out some kind of malicious activity against an airport . and airports need to know their threats . for us , we have threats from criminal activity to being targets of a terrorism attack , '' stover said . in the wake of congressional scrutiny of airport employee screening procedures , private security guards at atlanta 's airport last month began checking employee bags as the first step toward moving toward full employee screening . the airport also plans to reduce the number of secure access doors from 70 to 10 . `` in the last six months ... people are being recruited to engage in terrorist acts , '' said miguel southwell , the airport 's general manager . `` people are being recruited from the united states . so now we have a greater insider threat . '' the tsa is conducting a review of the feasibility of full employee screening , although previous government studies have concluded that would be too expensive and inefficient . watch anderson cooper 360 ° weeknights 8pm et . for the latest from ac360 ° click here .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- arsenal crashed out of the champions league at the last 16 stage for the fifth time in succession after falling agonizingly short in monaco . the premier league side recorded a 2-0 victory on the night but went out on away goals after the tie finished level at 3-3 on aggregate . monaco , which won 3-1 in the first leg , was overwhelmed for much of the contest and was fortunate to escape without being dumped out of the competition . olivier giroud 's first half strike and aaron ramsey 's 79th minute effort ensured a tense finale but the visiting side was unable to find a winner . no team had ever overcome a two-goal first leg deficit away from home in the champions league and progressed -- but arsenal 's first half display gave it hope . giroud , who has often been criticized this season for failing to take his chances , lashed in from close range with nine minutes of the first half remaining . ramsey , a substitute , drove the ball into the net after theo walcott 's effort had struck the post and monaco 's defenders hesitated . giroud had a chance late on to cap a dramatic fightback but his effort was saved on the line . `` the best team went through , '' arsenal defender per mertesacker told itv . `` monaco deserved it because they played much better in the first leg . we played well today but it was a massive deficit , and it was n't enough tonight . `` we came here and tried absolutely everything , and when you look at the game we could have scored more than two . `` monaco deserve it and that 's absolutely fine . they caused a lot of problems away from home . we have to admit that we regret the first game . `` but if we continue to play like that we 'll do well in the fa cup and the league . but play as badly as we did in the first game and you 're out of the champions league . monaco deserved it .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- kids , being kids , like to climb on things . more often than not , that 's ok . but when the thing in question is a war memorial ? that 's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the vietnam women 's memorial in washington . the photographer , matt munson , described the shot on facebook as `` two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran . '' the parents , he said , were laughing . `` it actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before i could take a picture of them all , '' munson wrote . `` the more i look at this photo the angrier i get . '' he has plenty of company there . as the photo went viral , comment after comment poured in on facebook and twitter , chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue , part of the vietnam veterans memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier . one nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet . the third looks skyward , to a rescue helicopter or perhaps god , according to the memorial foundation 's website . in munson 's photo , a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair . the older man , wearing a navy ballcap , and a woman also look on . the children 's parents are n't shown . disgusting . `` disgusting , '' facebook user trisha davidson wrote of the children 's actions . `` so wrong , '' twitter user karsonwithak chimed in . but not everyone was upset . `` i fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that , '' reddit user z3k3 wrote . but the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of world war ii `` loved watching the kids play on the local memorial . '' `` he saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little , '' z3k3 wrote . fair enough , some said . but some memorials are meant to be interactive . others are n't . and a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just does n't seem to be the place for play , a reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote . `` unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly ` use me , interact with me , to help carry my message ' -lrb- e.g. memorial benches -rrb- , the default is leave it respectfully alone , '' nickfree wrote . on the mommyish parenting blog , associate editor maria guido wrote that `` there 's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some . '' `` if these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- i would n't find anything wrong with the image , actually . but they 're not , '' she wrote . `` these parents were disrespectful , '' she wrote . `` the kids were being kids and following their directives . '' though the national parks service , which operates the memorial , did n't immediately respond to a request for comment , the vietnam veterans memorial fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect . `` please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation 's veterans , '' the group wrote on facebook . `` we hope our visitors understand this moving forward .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- no deal is better than a bad deal , say critics of president barack obama 's nuclear talks with iran . but what if republican and democratic opponents succeed in their intensifying effort to derail the diplomacy ? the price of failure could be an ugly blame game and cascade of political reprisals leading to nuclear chicken between iran and the west -- potentially leading to war . `` we would have to deal with a resumption of iran 's nuclear activities , which we do n't want to see take place . iran would have to deal with the resumption of sanctions , which they do n't want , '' said gary samore , a top nonproliferation official during obama 's first term . for now , the grave consequences of a breakdown in talks are one reason the united states and iran are still at the table , as a grueling diplomatic process reaches critical deadlines and painful political decisions beckon . iran deal : a treaty or not a treaty , that is the question . secretary of state john kerry and iranian foreign minister javad zarif are haggling over the remaining issues in lausanne , switzerland , ahead of an end-of-the-month deadline for a framework agreement , which then must be finalized by july 1 . but time may be running out for a deal in which six world powers would lift sanctions that have throttled iran 's economy in return for assurances that tehran will continue to stay a year or so away from developing a nuclear bomb . the white house puts the chances of a deal at only 50-50 : disputes still rage over the scale of nuclear infrastructure iran will be allowed to keep , the pace of sanctions relief and the extent of nuclear site inspections . despite the controversy stoked last week in washington when 47 gop senators sent a letter to iran 's leaders warning that the future of a deal was not guaranteed , many analysts believe that the talks will go on , even if the end-of-march deadline slips . `` not because all sides are desperate to keep talking . but i think sufficient momentum has been created in the last month or so that they see real possibilities , '' said robert einhorn , a former senior u.s. state department arms control official . obama may now have slightly more political leeway on the talks than before -- ironically because of attempts by u.s. and israeli critics to pen him in . a few weeks ago , skeptical democrats appeared to be lining up with republicans and approaching a veto-proof senate majority that could have forced obama to submit a deal to congress or accept the passage of new sanctions . either move could have killed the agreement . but the republicans ' letter and a fiercely critical speech to congress by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on the proposed deal prompted some skeptical democrats to close ranks , at least temporarily . but senate republican majority leader mitch mcconnell told cnn 's dana bash on `` state of the union '' that obama was on the cusp of agreeing a `` very bad '' deal that would allow iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure intact . he said that if an agreement is reached , he would bring up legislation that would give congress 60 days to back or reject a deal , despite fresh pleas from the white house for the gop to hold off . if no deal is reached , mcconnell said on sunday that he would press ahead with toughening sanctions on iran , he said . republican sources , meanwhile , said that despite the furor over the letter from the senators , no democrats had yet formally pulled support for legislation requiring the senate to have a say on the deal . that leaves the real possibility of a pitched political showdown on iran in the coming months . the opening for diplomacy is meanwhile not endless . and if no deal emerges by july , political pressure for a tougher administration stance towards iran may be unstoppable . if diplomacy fails , how events unfold will be dictated by how the process collapses ; who gets the blame ; and the political pressures exerted on obama and iranian president hassan rouhani in washington and tehran . `` if , at the end of june , there is not a deal , and talks have broken off , i think that it is inevitable that the congress will adopt new sanctions legislation , '' said einhorn , now with the brookings institution . `` what that will mean is the iranians will reciprocate . '' iran could start up centrifuges halted during the nuclear negotiations , bring more advanced machinery online and enrich uranium to the potent 20 % level that would get it closer to a weapon . and if it bars international inspectors , the world would have no idea how far iran is from making a bomb . what 's in the iran nuclear deal . the administration thinks that if the united states gets the blame for using hardball tactics that derail talks -- if , say , congress imposes more sanctions , as administration critics want -- there is no way its international partners would keep existing sanctions in place , let alone double down and impose new ones . in addition to unilateral u.s. sanctions congress has imposed , the united nations , european union and other countries have put in place their own sanctions cutting off iran from international partners and not just the american economy . cornelius adebahr , a european security specialist at the carnegie endowment for international peace , predicted iran would reap a propaganda victory . `` it would give ammunition for iran to say the u.s. is not reliable , '' he said . massachusetts institute of technology 's jim walsh , a specialist on the talks , said the iranian government would have little choice but to hit back at a tougher u.s. stance . `` the iranians are just not going to take it . they are going to feel condemned to respond . both sides will take their shovels and dig the holes deeper . '' walsh continued , `` we would be between a lame duck -lrb- u.s. -rrb- president for whom negotiations had just failed , a weakened rouhani , for whom negotiations have just failed , and a coming u.s. presidential election -- not exactly the best environment to return to talks and accomplish a diplomatic settlement . '' aborted negotiations that leave iran rededicated to its nuclear program raise the specter of tehran with a bomb -- or some enemy country taking military action to stop it . did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? but critics of the deal being worked out in switzerland do n't agree that such an outcome is the likeliest scenario . gop hawks and israel believe tehran is so desperate for sanctions relief , especially at a time of low oil prices , that it will have no choice but to offer a better deal than the one currently on the table and agree to the complete halt to uranium enrichment that israel and conservatives demand . `` if iran threatens to walk away from the table -- and this often happens in a persian bazaar -- call their bluff . they 'll be back , because they need the deal a lot more than you do , '' netanyahu maintained in his congress speech . former republican presidential nominee mitt romney made the case in a usa today op-ed friday that obama should `` walk away from a flimsy nuclear agreement . '' those opposed to the deal reject the administration that follow their advice would likely blow up the talks and set washington on an inevitable path to war as the only remaining way to disable iran 's nuclear infrastructure . instead , gop congressmen counter that several bills they are pushing , with significant democratic support , do not forestall the possibility of continued diplomacy if talks fail . they say that extra sanctions would increase obama 's leverage in diplomacy , not weaken it . even if talks do succeed this year , the long-term future of an agreement still would n't be assured . the diplomatic effort has powerful critics among hardliners in tehran who , whatever 's written on paper , could push to illicitly expand iran 's nuclear program and close in on a bomb . it 's not just republicans who fear tehran may violate any deal or test the limits of compliance . some people who back the talks admit that may be the case , too . in washington , congress will be required to lift the existing sanctions on iran to sustain the agreement in years to come -- a step that is hardly a given . and the stiff republican opposition means a deal is not assured of surviving the arrival of a new president in the white house come 2017 . a future republican president could reverse obama 's sanctions waivers fairly quickly , as the senators warned in their letter to iran . whether the new president would want to do so is another matter , however , especially if iran lives up to the terms of a deal , which would include stringent verification by international inspectors . he or she would risk a heavy political price . a unilateral washington pullout would likely infuriate u.s. partners and leave the rookie president facing a boiling crisis that could overwhelm the new administration 's nascent foreign policy . `` that 's what the administration is counting on -- if there is compliance and the deal is working well , '' said einhorn . kerry reminded congress this week that britain , france , germany , china and russia would all be cosignatories of a deal . `` if all those countries have said this is good and it 's working , -lrb- will a new president -rrb- just turn around and nullify it on behalf of the united states ? '' he asked . `` that 's not going to happen . '' congress would face the same cost-benefit calculation when it comes to the sanctions only lawmakers can expunge . in the event of a democratic white house victory in 2016 , the congressional math could also change in favor of a deal . and if republicans keep their majorities , lawmakers who are bent on thwarting obama may be less willing to handcuff a new gop president .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- creflo dollar 's new scheme to raise $ 60 million to purchase a luxury gulfstream g650 airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of televangelists exploiting their churches ' tax-exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets . preaching the word of faith , or `` prosperity gospel , '' and capitalizing on lax government oversight of his church 's finances has enriched dollar and his family to the detriment of his followers and the american taxpayer . world changers church international , dollar 's 30,000-member church , is a tax-exempt organization under the internal revenue code . that means the church 's donors receive a tax exemption for their donations -lrb- including for dollar 's new jet ambitions -rrb- , and the church pays no tax on the revenue . what 's more , because it is organized as a church , the federal government does not require world changers to file a publicly available tax return , as other nonprofit organizations are required to do . those tax returns provide at least some financial information to donors and the public about the organization , including its revenues , assets , expenditures and executive compensation . dollar is known for his custom suits , luxury homes and private jets that ferry him , among other places , from his home base in college park , georgia , to his satellite church in manhattan , where he and his wife reportedly have a $ 2.5 million apartment . for dollar , though , these excesses are n't embarrassments . instead , they are proof that his theology works , that god blesses the faithful with abundant riches . dollar tells his congregants to `` sow a seed '' with him , promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and , essentially , a return on their investment . to promoters of the word of faith , or prosperity gospel , `` sowing a seed '' with your pastor is required for god 's blessing , even if you 're taking it out of your rent money or the last remaining cash in your wallet . many christians find word of faith a heretical theology , an embarrassing distortion of jesus ' teachings , not to mention a fraud on congregants . while the government can not constitutionally mediate theological disputes or otherwise interfere in a church 's internal affairs , it can use its oversight powers to ensure that preachers who use their pulpits for profit do n't exploit the tax advantages afforded to ordinary houses of worship to pursue their legitimate charitable purposes . in 2007 , the senate finance committee , under the chairmanship of iowa republican sen. charles grassley , launched an investigation into the financial practices of six televangelists , including dollar . the committee requested documents from dollar and his wife , taffi , explaining that taxpayers `` should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations . '' the documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for world changers , information about related for-profit and nonprofit entities , and data on executive compensation and the church 's real and personal assets . more than three years later , after an outcry from the televangelists , most visibly dollar 's mentor kenneth copeland , the committee opted to abandon its efforts to instigate any sort of regulatory changes . instead , the committee called on the ministries to engage in `` self-reform , '' even though the committee staff 's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries , including dollar 's , were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability . of the six televangelists from whom the committee sought financial data , dollar was deemed the `` least cooperative . '' without dollar 's cooperation , the committee was left to piece together a puzzle about his finances through public documents , third parties and news reports . it concluded that in 2006 , world changers had received $ 69 million in contributions at its atlanta church alone , that the dollars owned two multimillion-dollar homes in georgia , and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury gulfstream dollar now seeks to acquire . the committee staff was clearly troubled by the array of business entities , `` including private airports and aircraft leasing companies , '' that raised red flags `` about the use of the church 's tax-exempt status to avoid taxation . '' precisely because of dollar 's lack of cooperation , the staff concluded , `` we are unable to determine whether and the extent to which they are reporting and paying taxes on income earned in those entities . '' dollar is now looking to raise $ 60 million for this new aircraft , purportedly `` to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord jesus christ . '' four years after the abandonment of the senate finance committee 's televangelist investigation , it looks like the absence of government oversight has only emboldened creflo dollar .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a salary dispute between north and south korea has sent jitters through factory owners operating at an industrial complex that is supposed to be a symbol of cooperation for the divided korean peninsula . the disagreement started in late february , when the north korean government demanded an increase of around $ 8.60 a month for north korean employees working in the kaesong industrial complex . south korea is working on a response to the demands , leaving factory owners worried about the threat of a factory shutdown . `` i 'm already nervous about the situation because of the traumatic experience in 2013 when the north closed down the complex , '' said yoo chang-geun , the south korean head of an automobile parts manufacturer that employs 400 north koreans in kaesong . yoo 's company , sj tech , operates out of kaesong , which is just north of the demilitarized zone in north korean territory . he was referring to north korea 's monthslong closure of kaesong in 2013 , during a period of heightened tension on the peninsula . about 125 south korean companies operate out of kaesong , employing more than 50,000 north korean workers . an official from the south korean government 's unification ministry , who according to policy spoke to cnn on condition of anonymity , says companies at kaesong pay their north korean workers an average of $ 155.50 a month . north korea is demanding an increase of roughly 5.5 % , to an equivalent $ 164.10 a month . the south korean government argues that the salary hike is a breach of an existing agreement for the industrial park , which first opened in 2004 . the official called the north 's request a `` one-sided demand . '' the official did not rule out the possibility that penalties could be imposed on south korean companies if they individually agree to raise employee salaries . manufacturers in kaesong rely on the government in seoul to represent them in negotiations with pyongyang . `` it feels like we 're entering a very difficult phase where innocent corporations are being beaten up by political fights between the north and south , '' kim seo-jin , the director of corporate association of the kaesong industrial complex , said wednesday . experts say this is n't the first time the north and south have butted heads over employee salaries in kaesong . the industrial park was established as a symbol of cooperation at a time when a previous government in south korea was pursuing a `` sunshine policy '' of friendship with its northern rival . south korean companies benefited from the extremely low cost of north korean labor . meanwhile , north korea gained a valuable stream of hard currency revenue by appropriating an undisclosed amount of salary from its citizens working in kaesong . south korean employers also made a practice of giving small food bonuses to some hungry employees . for a time , this came in the form of `` choco pies , '' a packaged south korean dessert . the snacks reportedly became highly-prized items on the black market in the communist north 's rigidly controlled economy . eventually , employers transitioned to giving workers instant noodles , as one former kaesong factory owner told cnn in 2014 , `` in order to provide a more substantial snack . '' `` the whole project is built with an understanding that north korean wages should and will continue to rise , '' says john delury , associate professor at yonsei university 's graduate school of international studies in seoul . but one factory owner said the communist regime 's most recent approach to the salaries is problematic . `` the amount of the pay raise demanded this time is small , '' said sj tech 's yoo chang-geun . `` but having this kind of precedent may lead to losing control of the operation in the complex . '' experts say seoul and pyongyang 's approach to the kaesong salary dispute will serve as an important barometer for the direction of future relations between the rival governments . `` kaesong is the last living legacy of the sunshine policy , '' says professor delury of yeonsei university . `` if something like wage disputes lead to the shutdown or freezing of kaesong , that would be a major blow .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- calling state bans on same-sex marriage `` incompatible with the constitution , '' the obama administration friday filed a brief at the u.s. supreme court in support of couples who are making challenges in kentucky , michigan , ohio and tennessee . `` the marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights , responsibilities and status of civil marriage , '' solicitor general donald b. verrilli jr. wrote . he said the states have `` burdened petitioners in every aspect of life that marriage touches , from the mundane to the profound . '' the brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide . the court will hear arguments in the state cases on april 28 . verrilli said the laws `` impose concrete harms on same-sex couples and send the inescapable message that same-sex couples and their children are second-class families , unworthy of the recognition and benefits that opposite-sex couples take for granted . '' the bans , he said , `` can not be reconciled with the fundamental constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws . '' he said there is `` no adequate justification for such a discriminatory and injurious exercise of state control . '' verrilli stressed that throughout history lesbian and gay people have encountered numerous barriers that have `` prevented them from full , free , and equal participation in american life . '' in an op-ed earlier this week , published in usa today , attorney general eric holder wrote , `` marriage equality is an idea whose time has come . '' president barack obama 's position on same-sex marriage has evolved . in may 2012 , in an interview with abc news , he announced his support for gay marriage . `` at a certain point , '' he said , `` i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same-sex couples should be able to get married . '' at his 2013 inauguration he said , `` our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law . '' in february 2013 , the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging california 's ban on same sex marriage . verilli argued that california law provided same sex couples registered as domestic partners all the legal incidents of marriage , but denied them the `` designation of marriage . '' ultimately , the supreme court dismissed that case . supporters of the state bans have until the end of the month to file their briefs . thursday was the deadline for briefs in support of petitioners . james obergefell , the named plaintiff in the case , came to the court friday as the human rights campaign delivered a brief signed by over 200,000 individuals in support of same-sex marriage . in an interview , obergefell said his journey began when he challenged ohio 's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage on death certificates . he was legally married to his partner , john arthur james , in maryland in 2013 , but after arthur died , ohio officials refused to recognize obergefell as his spouse . asked what it would mean to him if his side wins , obergefell said , '' it will mean john and i matter . it will mean we have the same rights and responsibilities as other americans .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- starbucks charges more than $ 5 for a large -lrb- `` venti '' in starbucks speak -rrb- caramel frappuccino , yet no one bats an eye . but when the ceo of starbucks announced a plan he hoped would ease racial tensions , the response was immediate outrage ! this latest controversy started monday when starbucks ceo howard schultz unveiled a new initiative in which starbucks baristas would write the words `` race together '' on coffee cups to help spark a dialogue on race . schultz even took out full-page ads in the new york times and usa today touting this effort . twitter immediately lit up with a flurry of angry tweets -- apparently from people who have consumed far too much caffeine . surprisingly , though , the backlash came from all sides . one self-described conservative tweeted this : . a person who noted her support of progressive causes in her twitter profile tweeted : . even people in the middle expressed scorn with tweets such as : . i , on the other hand , applaud schultz 's efforts , at least in theory . as schultz correctly stated when discussing the genesis for `` race together , '' `` if we just keep going about our business ... and ignoring this -lrb- racial issue -rrb- , then i think we are , in a sense , part of the problem . '' sure , i also see some logistical problems with the `` get your iced mocha frappuccino with a shot of racial tolerance '' approach . first , i live in new york city , where new yorkers barely have the patience to wait for a cup of plain old coffee to be poured let alone stand in line longer while people engage in a nuanced discourse on race . i can envision awkward situations where the baristas ask a customer , `` so how do you want your coffee ? '' to which the customer responds , `` black . '' for some reason saying `` black '' in the context of this program could feel uncomfortable . next thing you know , starbucks will have to coin politically correct terms for `` black '' coffee . and as a practical matter , only 40 % of starbucks employees are minorities . consequently , in most starbucks , the conversation about racial tolerance will between be between two white people . but let 's put those issues aside . the swift and angry backlash against schultz 's idea proves once again that not only do n't we live in a post-racial america , we live in a hyper-racial one . in fact , a recent cnn/orc poll found 40 % of americans believe racial relations have become worse during the six years barack obama has been in the white house . it 's strikingly obvious that if we are going to improve this situation , we need to have a candid and brutally honest discussion about the underlying factors contributing to racism , the lack of empathy for people of other races , etc. . and that 's simply what starbucks ' `` race together '' stated goal is : `` to stimulate conversation , compassion and positive action regarding race in america . '' starbucks ' senior vice president of communications , corey dubrowa , deleted his twitter account monday after `` feeling personally attacked in a cascade of negativity '' and being `` overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion '' in response to `` race together . '' but dubrowa was back on twitter on tuesday night . why ? because he truly believed in `` the power of meaningful , civil , thoughtful , respectful open conversation . '' dubrowa 's reaction may just be a teachable moment on discussing race . it 's truly not an easy topic to broach . the initial response by some , like dubrowa , may be to shut down when racial discussions become uncomfortable . but then , hopefully like dubrowa did later , the conversation can be rejoined within a framework that 's respectful to all involved . but to be blunt , one of the biggest obstacles in even starting this conversation is that most white americans do n't want to discuss race , as polls have confirmed . for example , after the grand jury in ferguson , missouri , did n't indict police officer darren wilson in the killing of teenager michael brown , a poll found that 80 % of blacks felt that the shooting raised important issues about race that needed to be discussed . how many white people agreed ? only 37 % . and personally i have seen some white friends become defensive when race issues are raised . why ? because many view it as an accusation that they are somehow racist -lrb- or at least complicit in racism -rrb- as opposed to a starting point for a productive conversation . the question is how can we begin that talk about race that our nation desperately needs to have ? true , the line at starbucks might not be the best place . but it has to start somewhere if we are going to close the racial gap that many , including myself , feel is growing .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- scientists at nasa are one step closer to understanding how much water could have existed on primeval mars . these new findings also indicate how primitive water reservoirs there could have evolved over billions of years , indicating that early oceans on the red planet might have held more water than earth 's arctic ocean , nasa scientists reveal in a study published friday in the journal science . `` our study provides a solid estimate of how much water mars once had , by determining how much water was lost to space , '' said geronimo villanueva , a scientist at nasa 's goddard space flight center . `` with this work , we can better understand the history of water on mars . '' to find answers to this age-old question about martian water molecules , scientists used the world 's three major infrared telescopes , in chile and hawaii , to measure traces of water in the planet 's atmosphere over a range of areas and seasons , spanning from march 2008 to january 2014 . `` from the ground , we could take a snapshot of the whole hemisphere on a single night , '' said goddard 's michael mumma . scientists looked at the ratio of two different forms -- or isotopes -- of water , h2o and hdo . the latter is made heavier by one of its hydrogen atoms , called deuterium , which has a neutron at its core in addition to the proton that all hydrogen atoms have . that weighed down hdo more , while larger amounts of hydrogen from h2o floated into the atmosphere , broke away from mars ' low gravity and disappeared into space . as a result , water trapped in mars ' polar ice caps has a much higher level of hdo than fluid water on earth does , the scientists said . the scientists compared the ratio of h2o to hdo in mars ' atmosphere today to the ratio of the two molecules trapped inside a mars meteorite , a stone that broke off from mars -- perhaps when an asteroid hit -- and landed on earth some 4.5 billion years ago . they were able to determine how much that ratio had changed over time and estimate how much water has disappeared from mars -- about 87 % . the findings indicate that the red planet could have had its fair share of blue waters , possibly even yielding an ocean . according to nasa , there might have been enough water to cover up to 20 % of mars ' surface . that would amount to an ocean proportionally larger than the atlantic on earth . `` this ocean had a maximum depth of around 5,000 feet or around one mile deep , '' said villanueva . nasa scientists say that much of this water loss happened over billions of years , along with a loss of atmosphere . and as the planet 's atmospheric pressure dropped , it was harder for water to stay in liquid form . heat also contributed to its evaporation . as a result , the remaining primeval ocean water continued to move toward the poles , where it eventually froze . `` with mars losing that much water , the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought , suggesting it might have been habitable for longer , '' said mumma . cnn 's ben brumfield contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- nasa astronaut scott kelly has started a trip to the record books . he plans to spend 342 days on the international space station -- the longest stretch of time any u.s. astronaut has spent in space . kelly lifted off friday aboard a russian soyuz rocket that launched from kazakhstan . the rocket docked at the iss at 9:33 p.m. et , according to a tweet from nasa , with hatches between the soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. et . kelly will stay twice as long as any u.s. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station , giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long-duration space flights . on earth , scientists will perform parallel studies on scott kelly 's identical twin brother , retired astronaut mark kelly . `` it 's a lot of fun , '' kelly said at a media briefing in january . `` space station is a magical place . '' two cosmonauts are riding up with kelly : mikhail kornienko and gennady padalka . kornienko also will stay up for a year . padalka will only stay up for six months . the trio will join three crew members already on the space station : u.s. astronaut terry virts , russian cosmonaut anton shkaplerov and italian astronaut samantha cristoforetti . other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just kelly and kornienko on the station . kelly , 51 , hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by nasa astronaut michael lopez-alegria and russian cosmonaut mikhail tyurin . they spent over seven months on the iss -- from september 18 , 2006 , to april 21 , 2007 . he is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission . when added to his previous space missions , that would give him a total of 522 days in space , breaking the record of u.s. astronaut mike fincke . fincke spent a combined 381 days , 15 hours and 11 minutes in space , according to his official nasa bio . while kelly shoots to set space station and other u.s. records , padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human . he 's already spent more than 710 days in space , including stays on russia 's mir space station and three previous stints on the international space station . why do it ? why stay up on the station so long ? nasa wants to know more about the impact of long-duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to mars and deeper into space . and the space station , in orbit 250 miles above earth , is the best place available to study that . spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll . nasa says space station astronauts have vision changes , bone loss , muscle atrophy and other problems . nasa says the experiments should have benefits on earth , such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections . the space station has about the same living space as a six-bedroom , two bathroom house . and it has a 360-degree bay window with a great view . but astronauts and cosmonauts still report feeling isolated and confined at times . kelly will document his feelings about being away from his two children and the rest of his family . `` i 'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience , '' kelly said . he also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long-term space flight . will he tell all ? `` i plan to be completely honest about it , '' he said , but ... `` who knows , maybe there are some crazy thoughts i 'll have at the end that i would n't want to share . '' mark kelly has volunteered for nasa 's `` twins study '' to see how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments . he is the husband of former u.s. rep. gabrielle giffords of arizona , who left office after being wounded in a january 2011 assassination attempt . `` he thinks it 's great that he can still be a participant in this , '' scott kelly said . so mark will be on earth getting poked and prodded by researchers -- while scott makes history in orbit . final candidates announced for one-way trip to mars .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- you may not know it , but comedian trevor noah actually made a bit of history even before being named to succeed jon stewart as host of `` the daily show . '' the 31-year-old south african comic has made only a few appearances on that show since popping up as a correspondent in december , but he 's better known within the world of standup comedy . in 2013 , noah became the first african comedian to perform on `` the tonight show with jay leno . '' he 's been on the cover of rolling stone in south africa , where he 's extremely popular . he 's joked about being the son of a black african woman and a white swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in south africa . `` my mom would be arrested . she would be fined , and still she was like ` ooh , i do n't care , i want a white man , ooh , ' '' he once told an audience at london 's soho theater during his standup show `` the racist . '' `` and my dad was also like , well , you know how the swiss love chocolate . '' why mixed-race comic was ` born a crime ' race , identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act . because of his parents ' then-illegal relationship , he joked , `` in the streets , my father could n't walk with us . he would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile . and my mom could walk with me , but every time the police went by , she would drop me . i felt like a bag of weed . '' noah has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid . in 2012 , he told npr that he was fascinated by how americans discuss race . `` i got to baltimore , and i was expecting ... because urban means built up and new , you know , '' he said . `` so i got there , and i was , ` whoa , it 's not as urban as people told me . ' ... but it 's very black . i 'll tell you that much . '' noah told cnn 's `` african voices '' in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera , hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the 2012 documentary `` you laugh but it 's true '' -- he moved to the united states for a year to try to raise his profile . he returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the states , he said . `` comedy is really getting quite popular in south africa , '' noah said . `` it 's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream , which is very good . i think the reason it 's doing so well is because south africans need to laugh and south africans want to laugh . '' noah has moved to the u.s. permanently and told newsweek , `` i 've always wanted to be a comedian in the world . i do n't want to be labeled a south african comedian . '' on `` the daily show , '' he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled `` spot the africa , '' which juxtaposed modern-day south africa and the united states . what remains to be seen is whether what the guardian has described as `` his combination of terribly polite , butter-wouldn ` t-melt stage presence and biting , often brutal gags '' will translate into success on `` the daily show .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- as planets go , mercury does n't get a lot of love . people spend more time on google searching for queen singer freddy mercury than planet mercury ... and freddie 's been gone for nearly a quarter-century . not even nasa spends much time there , making it the least-explored inner planet in the solar system . but one question has long perplexed scientists : why 's the darned thing so dark ? compared with our own moon , which is about the same size , mercury reflects much less light . scientists at lawrence livermore national laboratory , brown university and the planetary sciences institute say they may have found the answer : it 's been `` effectively painted black , '' in the words of megan bruck syal , a postdoctoral researcher at lawrence livermore . over the eons , the researchers argue in a paper published monday in the journal nature geoscience , microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon-rich comets may have contributed enough dark-hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light . the pieces seem to fit together : there 's a lot more carbon dust thrown off from comets close to the sun , where mercury orbits -- about 50 times as much for mercury as for our moon , the researchers say . and tests using a big nasa gun made to simulate planetary impacts on a small scale seem to show the theory is plausible , the authors say . `` we show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent , '' said peter schultz , a professor emeritus of geological sciences at brown university . `` from the standpoint of spectral analysis , it 's like an invisible paint .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the desert and dun-colored cliffs around the town of tataouine were once the backdrop for the movie `` star wars , '' much of which was filmed in this neglected corner of tunisia in 1976 . this struggling town on the fringes of the sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict , as a way-station for jihadists crossing the libyan border 60 miles to the east . earlier this month , before the gun attack on the bardo museum in tunis , three young men were arrested here as they allegedly made plans to cross into libya to join a terrorist network . a local official told cnn they had since been taken to tunis for questioning . two arms caches have also been found in the region this month , one of which included rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition , thought to have been removed from a libyan armory in the aftermath of moammar gadhafi 's ouster in 2011 . driving near the border , it 's quickly obvious why the tunisian government is so anxious about libya 's implosion and the emergence there of an isis affiliate whose tentacles stretch half-way across the country . this open space is vast and sparsely populated . smugglers ' tracks criss-cross the endless scrub and steep , arid hills that run along the border . gasoline , drugs and other contraband have long been smuggled across the frontier . near the town of remada , south of tataouine , a couple of soldiers manned a checkpoint . they wore protective jackets -- whether for show or because of the perceived threat from islamist militants , it 's hard to know . when we arrived , passports were requested and phone calls made . we were escorted into the town and politely but firmly told we could go no further without written authorization . exactly four years ago we had passed through remada unchallenged . tunisians had just launched the arab spring . there was a mood of heady optimism and the security apparatus of the ben ali regime had melted away . but already libya was falling apart , as different groups of rebels fought to oust gadhafi . thousands of foreign workers were then trying to escape the violence through the few official border crossings . now libya 's descent into chaos means those crossings are sometimes closed , and it 's foreign fighters using the smugglers ' trails that tunisia must worry about . at the national guard building in remada the officer in charge -- a burly figure in his mid-40s - was wearing a `` new york 1999 '' sweatshirt and appeared to be one of many plainclothes security personnel in the town . he was happy to talk but did n't want his name reported . ignoring calls on his cell phone , he lamented the state of the arab world and the expansion of daesh , as isis is frequently called . look at iraq , syria , libya ... of course tunisia is threatened , he said . the tunisians are doing what they can , he said . there is now a 1.8-mile no-go zone inside the border , and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles . the security presence has been boosted seven - to ten-fold , but even so there were n't enough men or equipment . the border , after all , is 380 miles long . a much wider buffer zone -- 12 miles deep -- has also been created , which people can only enter with permission . this has not gone down well with local herders whose goats and sheep live off the desert scrub . other measures taken by the tunisian authorities , according to the official in remada , include a ban on men aged 18-35 from going to libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there . another source said the ban applied to men under 30 . even so the two gunmen who stormed into the bardo museum last week -- both of them in their twenties -- had been able to cross illicitly into libya in december , according to tunisian state security minister rafik chelly . chelly told a tunisian network that the pair had received weapons training in the isis stronghold of derna . the mood among many tunisians seems much harder and more pragmatic than it was four years ago . a shopkeeper in a small village between tataouine and remada said there needs to be a security crackdown . he said people in the area led simple lives -- but they knew each other and noticed strangers . bassim , a taxi driver on the island of djerba , some 60 miles to the north of tataouine , was of a similar view . `` the people need to be the third eye of the security forces '' he said . `` and we need to think of the safety of visitors like we think of the safety of our families . '' bassim and hundreds of thousands of other tunisians have reason to be worried . they rely on tourism to make a living , and fear that isis will -- as it has threatened -- launch further attacks against foreigners visiting libya . bassim ferries tourists around djerba , whose luxury hotels and beaches are a popular destination for french and german tourists . it took the tourist industry years to recover from a terror attack on a synagogue on the island in 2002 in which 21 people were killed . bassim says he 's heard all too many horror stories about events in libya from the oil workers he took to djerba 's airport . others , mainly in the capital tunis , are apprehensive that the democratic gains of four years ago may be eroded or lost in a new security clampdown . they point to new anti-terrorism legislation that strengthens detention powers and the right of the authorities to monitor suspects ' phones and social media . the measure was being discussed in parliament wednesday when the attack was launched on the adjacent museum . tunisians say their country is at a crossroads as it tries to fend off the jihadist contagion seeping across north africa . their democracy is young and vulnerable . `` we want to be the hope of the arab world , '' said bassim , `` like we were four years ago . '' `` we still have hope , but now we have fear too . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there have been a few times in my career when i 've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace . no , i certainly do n't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing `` kumbaya '' together in the office , but i 'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me was n't , when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be , when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear , anxiety or what have you . i 'd love to say more about each of the women i 've met along the way who fit those descriptions , but my point is not to single anyone out . my goal is to ask the question , `` why ? '' obviously , not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior , but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up ? i figured this would be a perfect question for sophia nelson , author of a new self-help book for women called `` the woman code , '' and she did n't disappoint . unlocking ` the woman code ' : 4 tips to know your value . `` from the time we 're little girls , we 're taught to compete , '' said nelson during a recent conversation at cnn . `` i need to be prettier , taller , smarter , my hair needs to be straighter , curlier , whatever it is . i need to get the better looking guy . i need to always be better than because we 're taught to come from a place of lack as women . '' the way nelson , an award-winning author and journalist , radio and television personality and motivational speaker , sees it , we women need to start operating like the boys . men `` operate from a sense of , there 's this whole pie , and i want my piece , and i do n't care if he gets his piece , and maybe we even have to work together to start that business , start that company , '' said nelson . of course , it 's easier for a man not to worry `` if he gets his piece '' since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate america , but that is n't the case for women . today , just 5 % of s&p 500 chief executives are women and only 14 % of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women , according to a cnn money analysis . sheryl sandberg teams up with nba to get men to #leanin . decades ago , the situation was even worse . when i was just starting my television news career in 1990 , women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence . naturally , many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job . `` because they did n't think there could be ten of them , they only thought there could be one of them , '' said nelson . `` fast forward 20 years later . now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms , a number of women in congress . i could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us . '' which means we can lift as we climb , we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers , says nelson . `` how exactly do we do that ? '' i had to ask . nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other . first , nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about `` who 's in your row . '' `` if you hear another woman say , and i 've heard this , ' i do n't do women friends , i do n't have women friends , ' believe her and leave her alone . i mean that , listen to me now , '' said nelson . there are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women , so do n't invest any time , if possible , with people who do n't , she says . if you are in a meeting and you have a great idea , do n't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself , said nelson . `` collaborate , share , collaborate . ... so you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing . '' competition is healthy and we can compete , but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues ' playbook , she said . `` the guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of ' i want the dollars . i want to win the contract . i want to get the business . ' we have to get in that same mindset . '' we 're all busy but we 've got to slow down and mentor , said nelson . `` we have to build a bench , '' she said . `` men do this well again . you 've seen it in corporate , i 've seen it . the guys go out and golf . they do things together and they 're building up the next young man leader . whatever field we 're in ... we 're less likely to do it because we 're busy . we 've got to mentor . '' when you lift other women as you climb , said nelson , you realize it 's reciprocal . `` it 's not all about you . '' we women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations , i added . `` the right women , '' said nelson . `` i want to caveat that . and again , i do n't mean to be mean or catty but ... i know a lot of women in power positions that do n't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do . '' this is a tough one for us , says nelson . we need to be willing to say to another woman that we did n't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up , not pulling her down . `` do n't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her . you 'd be amazed at how silly we can be . we 're still in kindergarten some of us , '' said nelson . `` gossip is still one of the most rampant , nasty things we do as women to each other . and it hurts . it really damages women . '' why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter @kellywallacetv or cnn living on facebook .

'' the numbers speak for themselves . the united states has 5 % of the world 's population but 25 % of its prisoners -- by far the most of any country . meanwhile , between 2009 and 2012 , the top 1 % of americans captured 95 % of all income growth . so while it is true unemployment is down and wall street is booming , the combination of a debilitating criminal justice system and low wages has created an environment in which men such as those featured in `` dawg fight '' feel backyard fights are actually one of the less nefarious ways they can make money . sens. rand paul , r-kentucky , and cory booker , d-new jersey , have become interesting bedfellows as they work to address the country 's runaway prison industry . this week , the pair , along with sen. kirsten gillibrand , d-new york , introduced a medical marijuana bill as another step toward decriminalizing the drug . this is a welcome step , because of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001-2010 , nearly 90 % was for simple possession , according to the american civil liberties union . and while whites and blacks use the drug at the same rate , blacks were arrested four times as often , the aclu said . that 's not to say all of the ex-cons in the 12-by-12 ring are nonviolent drug offenders . some , by their own admission , have done worse . but they are out of jail now , and do n't have the luxury of waiting to see if debates going on in washington actually result in laws . `` i do n't promote violence , i promote hope , '' said dada 5000 , who started west perrine fights in his mother 's backyard and who was once a bodyguard for mixed martial arts fighter kimbo slice . `` a lot of these men paid their debt back to society ; they did the rehab , but they still ca n't get a job . they do n't blame society for their life . ... -lrb- t -rrb- hey are back here in these streets , and they would like a second chance , a chance to do the right thing , but those chances are not there . we are an alternative to the bad things . '' i asked if the election of the first black president provided any inspiration at all , and he said , `` obama 's black , but he did n't grow up black , not like this . `` he never had to make do , to go without . he never was put inside those situations , those circumstances where desperation pushes you to the edge . he 's had what he thinks are hard times , but it 's nothing like this . if he came down here , he would be blown away . '' corben echoes the sentiment . `` the unemployment rate is all well and good for people in washington , but those are not the people who are trying to make it , '' he said . `` people think of miami , they think of beaches and ocean drive and all of that . this is the part of miami people do n't want to talk about . `` but you know what ? miami is not unique . there are a lot of cities like this , '' he adds . `` dawg fight '' certainly does n't sugarcoat anything . the fights are raw , vicious . but then so is the reality in which it is based . two of the fighters featured are dead -- including one on whom police used a taser . with prize money as little as $ 100 , the chances this lifestyle alone can elevate a family out of poverty is slim to none . but what are the alternatives ? i grew up in a rough neighborhood on the eastside of detroit . i was mugged in elementary school by a grown man . and even i do n't claim to know the desperation these men see on a daily basis . `` we do n't have al sharpton and jesse jackson coming down here to this level of hood , '' dada said . `` this is the real miami . we may not want to acknowledge it , but it is . `` and i bet if you go to some of the other cities where men do n't have any skills , they do n't have an education , they may have a record ... you 'll find the same thing , '' he added . `` what i 'm doing is n't barbaric , it 's a message .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- when vladimir putin reappears , he does it with style -- and an in-your-face attitude . the russian president attended a large concert in moscow 's red square on wednesday to commemorate the first anniversary of his country 's annexation of the ukrainian territory of crimea , an act condemned by many in the international community as illegal . only putin does n't call it annexation . he calls it reunification . according to the presidential website , putin attended the `` we 're together ! '' concert and meeting `` celebrating the first anniversary of crimea and sevastopol 's reunification with russia . '' the peninsula became part of the soviet union in 1917 , following the russian revolution . but in 1991 , following the breakup of the soviet union , it became part of a newly independent ukraine . on march 16 , 2014 , crimea held a referendum on whether to continue as part of ukraine or to cast its lot with the russian federation . the result was overwhelming , at least among those voting : 95 % said they wanted to become part of russia . a mere two days later , russia annexed the territory . putin said later that he had been planning the move even before the referendum was held . `` friends ! '' the president said in red square on wednesday , according to his website , `` exactly one year ago , russia , which we are speaking of so much right now , and the russian people showed amazing togetherness and patriotism in supporting the aspirations of the people of crimea and sevastopol to return to their native shores . '' the issue , he said , was `` our history , our spirituality and our statehood , the things that make us a single people and single united nation . '' also participating , the website said , were `` popular russian music groups and singers . '' putin was recently out of sight without explanation for 10 days , during which time various meetings were canceled . he reappeared only monday . lest anyone doubt he was still in charge , putin , who prides himself on his fitness , has been displaying a different form of muscle this week -- the military kind . he mobilized russia 's entire northern fleet in a military exercise that reportedly ranks among the largest since the breakup of the soviet union . nato reported that , on tuesday , estonian radar detected an unspecified number of aircraft over the baltic sea . nato sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that `` the russian military aircraft '' flew on into the airspace of the russian exclave of kaliningrad .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the country 's largest presbyterian denomination has changed its definition of marriage to include gay couples -- though not explicitly . presbyterian church -lrb- usa -rrb- approved an amendment to its constitution after most of its 171 presbyteries -- or governing bodies -- voted for it , pc -lrb- usa -rrb- said tuesday . before , the definition said marriage was between `` a man and a woman . '' the new definition says , in part , that `` marriage involves a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , to love and support each other for the rest of their lives . '' already , pc -lrb- usa -rrb- ministers can perform same-sex marriages in states where such marriages are legal , the group said . but no teaching elder or session can be forced to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies if they do not believe they are appropriate . not all members supported the decision . in a post on pc -lrb- usa -rrb- 's website , jean and robert gorney accused the church of going against the bible and threatened to leave . `` we are not to change the bible , '' their post said . `` i do n't care who disagrees . '' but the covenant network of presbyterians , which says it supports `` a fully inclusive church , '' welcomed the news tuesday night . `` the change aligns the church 's constitution with a reality that has long been true : both same-gender and opposite-gender couples have been living in relationships that demonstrate covenant faithfulness , shared discipleship and mutual love , '' the group said . `` we are also aware that the discussion has been a difficult one for many , and that some will feel a deep sense of pain over this decision . the covenant network is committed to fostering healthy dialogue and working with those who hold a view different from ours , seeking opportunities for us to model an authentic and productive unity .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- entertainers are paid for entertaining and it 's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the olympics , says 100m hurdler sally pearson . in 2014 , while the winner of wimbledon received $ 2,600,000 and the augusta masters champion picked up $ 1,620,000 , when pearson won gold in the olympics three years ago she received zero prize money . `` people come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them , we are entertainers '' the australian , who set an olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012 , told cnn anchor alex thomas . `` entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage , and that 's exactly what we 're doing in a sporting sense . '' billions might have tuned in to watch london 's 2012 olympic games which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory , but the international olympic committee 's current policy is to -lrb- ioc -rrb- hand out gold , silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes , but no financial remuneration . `` i can see why they do n't , and i 'm sure they want to keep it like that , they want to keep it pure , '' added pearson . `` to be honest we 're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not . but the games would n't happen without the athletes . '' it also would n't happen without sponsors . the ioc has just signed a new eight-year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant toyota -- reportedly worth just under $ 1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include mcdonald 's and coca-cola . athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals , government support , grants and part-time work . in 2012 only half of american track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $ 15,000 a year from their sport . the fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history , pearson told the australia 's daily telegraph in 2013 how a year after her olympic gold medal in london she still was n't attracting enough sponsors . no stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship . while she has some support from qantas , amp and adidas , appearance fees and prize money in the diamond league -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28-year-old . now targeting more medal success at the 2016 rio olympics , pearson achieved a resounding win at the queensland track classic on march 7 with a time of 12.74 s. even so the issue of olympic prize money still clearly grates . `` i think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016 , i think it might be time to at least have a think about it , and discuss it because there 's no such thing as the olympics without athletics or athletes , '' said pearson .

london -lrb- cnn -rrb- an 18-year-old british man has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to join isis in syria , uk police say . counterterrorism officers arrested the man at his home in hodge hill , in the city of birmingham , early monday , west midlands police said . `` the operation was pre-planned and intelligence led . there was no immediate threat to public safety , '' they said in a statement . the arrest follows that of three teenagers from northwest london on sunday after they were intercepted by turkish police in istanbul . the two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested `` on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts , '' the metropolitan police said . they have since been released on bail . the investigation started friday , after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to syria . they were traveling with a 19-year-old , police said . british authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with turkish officials friday , and that night , they landed in istanbul on a flight from barcelona , spain , a turkish official told cnn . the teens were stopped with another person seen as suspicious by turkish intelligence at the airport 's risk analysis center , which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter turkey . turkish authorities questioned the teens , the turkish official said , and the metropolitan police said the three returned to london shortly before midnight saturday and were arrested . last week , turkish authorities said they had arrested a person -- working for an undisclosed nation 's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three british girls who are thought to have entered syria to join isis . british police say they think the three east london classmates -- shamima begum , 15 ; kadiza sultana , 16 ; and amira abase , 15 -- traveled to syria after flying from london to istanbul on february 17 . metropolitan police on monday announced a new media campaign to deter young people from traveling to syria . radio and press advertisements highlighting the influence a mother could have on her daughters would be placed in ethnic minority media , police said . the campaign said that it was mothers who often noticed changes in behavior that could signal an intention to travel to syria , they said . there was increasing concern about the number of women traveling to syria , deputy assistant commissioner helen ball said . `` it is an extremely dangerous place , and the reality of the lifestyle they are greeted with when they arrive is far from that promoted online by terrorist groups , '' she said . `` the option of returning home is often taken away from them , leaving families at home devastated and with very few options to secure a safe return for their loved one , '' ball said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- what 's your company doing this year for march madness ? if your workplace is like most , the answer is a big fat nothing . instead of leveraging the ncaa 's annual tournament and turning it into a genuine bonding experience between colleagues , most organizations pretend it is n't happening . on the surface , ignoring a sporting event that takes place during regular work hours might appear like sound business practice . after all , companies need to generate profit , and it 's hard to generate profit when your employees are huddled around a television , right ? wrong . what this perspective overlooks is that productivity is n't simply a function of how many hours we spend at the office . it also depends on the quality of our workplace experience . and one critical feature of that experience is how closely connected we feel to our colleagues . research has consistently demonstrated that we are more effective at our jobs when we feel attached to the people around us . how do strong colleague relationships elevate our performance ? for one thing , they make us more motivated . when you and your colleagues are close , failing to perform your duties generates more than a dissatisfied customer or an unhappy manager -- it means letting down your friends . the social pressure to achieve results can serve as a stronger motivator than anything a boss can say . closer connections also foster a sense of trust and more candid dialogue . studies comparing the collaboration patterns of friends to mere acquaintances indicate that friends are more willing to ask for help and more comfortable speaking up when a colleague is off on the wrong track . performance aside , workplace friendships benefit organizations for another reason : employees with richer friendships tend to stay on with their company for longer periods of time . despite these considerable benefits , at most companies , friendships are an afterthought . to motivate employees , managers tend to rely on bonuses , promotions , and salary increases , ignoring the fact that as humans , we all have a basic psychological need for meaningful relationships . yet the research is clear : when we feel valued and respected by those around us , we 're not only more motivated -- we 're also happier , healthier , and more productive . for too many organizations , investing in quality employee relationships means one thing : team-building exercises . think ice breakers , trust falls and scavenger hunts . every year , corporations spend millions on off-site retreats and weekend getaways packed with cringeworthy activities that purportedly foster better communication . but here 's the truth : while awkward collaborations may spark brief experiences of closeness , they rarely translate into lasting friendships . so what does ? studies suggest three factors are essential to the development of authentic , meaningful friendships : familiarity -lrb- being around the same colleague often -rrb- , similarity -lrb- finding commonalities in your background -rrb- , and self-disclosure -lrb- revealing personal information about yourself every now and then , and having your co-worker do the same -rrb- . few activities include all three of these elements . this explains why close relationships usually take years to develop . but interestingly , office game-viewing parties come close . they present opportunities for colleagues to mingle with those from other departments and connect over shared interests . for many , the ncaa basketball tournament is associated with their experience at college , which leads them to share stories about their past , prompting co-workers to do the same . unlike team-building experiences that compel employees to engage with one another , game-viewing parties position people to connect voluntarily . and that feature can make all the difference . in recent years , a number of forward-thinking workplaces have begun leveraging march madness in intelligent ways . ogilvy & mather , for example , an international marketing agency based in new york , invites employees to watch tournament games on projection screens in conference rooms and the office cafeteria . to address the fact that not everyone has the time to follow college basketball , a virginia financial services firm called the motley fool offers a free `` bracketology '' class , where nonenthusiasts can get caught up on this year 's favorites and collect advice before filling out their brackets . a number of organizations , including office furniture manufacturer turnstone , even serve game-day snacks , such as pizza , popcorn , and chicken wings , to simulate the viewing experience of a sports bar , minus the alcohol . in addition to organizing a vibrant workplace gathering , there are also opportunities for making better use of the office tournament pool . here 's one idea : instead of having employees pay an entry fee -lrb- which discourages nonfans from joining in -rrb- , sponsor prizes so that everyone participates . then , go beyond recognizing individual contestants and reward the team or department with the highest average score . this way , employees have reason to root for one another , fostering a sense of collaboration . another approach worth considering : using the office pool as a motivational tool . some years ago , nettel partners , a sales organization in philadelphia , launched a competition among its salespeople in the weeks before the ncaa tournament . the more appointments a salesperson secured with potential clients , the sooner he or she could select a team in the office draft . the results were astonishing . total cost to nettel for furnishing prizes : $ 300 , plus the price of a personalized basketball jersey . total impact on the business : a 35 % jump in appointments , not to mention a boost in office morale . as the ncaa tournament tips off this month , organizational leaders would be wise to re-examine their approach to march madness . instead of treating the tournament as a nuisance that prevents employees from working , perhaps it 's time we considered embracing it for what it is : an inexpensive opportunity for bringing our work teams closer together . without the trust falls .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's hardly news to state that air pollution is bad for people 's health . what might be more surprising to learn , though , is that air pollution is bad for the health of an unborn child , long before his or her lungs ever take their first breath . a growing body of research indicates that various forms of air pollution have a measurable impact on the health of babies , both in utero and after birth . we imagine the infant to be protected inside its mother 's body , but pollutants can reach the baby the same way nutrients and medicine do . lead , mercury and particulate matter are among the types of air pollution we know can impact the health of infants before and after birth . ozone , or smog , is the next candidate for addition to the list of air pollutants known to be harmful to fetal health . over the past several years , a number of studies have indicated a likely link between higher levels of maternal ozone exposure and poor health outcomes in infants , including changes in lung structure and function , low birth weight and neuro-behavioral abnormalities . many of these health effects can be expected to have lifelong consequences . these are deeply concerning results that require more investigation to understand fully . these studies add to a substantial amount of evidence showing the ill effects of ozone for people of all ages . estimates place the toll in 2007 at 15,000 premature deaths related to ozone among individuals of all ages . ozone also causes shortness of breath , wheezing and coughing , asthma attacks , increased risk of respiratory infections and increased need for people with lung diseases -- such as children with asthma -- to get medical treatment or be admitted to the hospital . how can a pregnant woman protect herself and her growing fetus from the harm caused by ozone ? after all , ozone is usually invisible -lrb- except in certain cases , as smog -rrb- and high levels are undetectable to the average individual . summertime air quality alerts may help in some cases , but some pregnant women can not avoid exposure . in addition , studies confirm that these daily pollution alerts are inadequate to protect our health because they are based on the present federal ozone standard , which does not include evidence from current , critical health science . in other words , the alerts sometimes fail to accurately indicate when the air is dangerous to breathe . thinking that it 's safe to work or play outside when ozone pollution levels trigger a yellow air quality alert -lrb- indicating a `` moderate '' level for ozone pollution -rrb- can significantly threaten the health of many vulnerable individuals . in order to truly protect our children , we need strong , national standards limiting ozone . ozone forms in the air from emissions from a number of sources , but the biggest culprits are cars , trucks and other motor vehicles , as well as power plants . the u.s. environmental protection agency -lrb- epa -rrb- proposed new ozone standards in november that would bring limits in line with the science . epa is accepting comments from the public on the standard until tuesday , march 17 , and both of our organizations have expressed support . an updated standard would help ensure we have access to accurate information about the air we breathe , and help drive reductions in ozone pollution to protect the health of all americans . strengthening the ozone standard to reflect the best current science will help save lives and protect our families , including pregnant women and their babies .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` breast is best '' -- you could call it a mantra of sorts that sums up much of today 's research on breastfeeding . not only does breastfeeding have clear short-term benefits , such as protection from infectious diseases and a reduction in mortality , it 's also been shown to be associated with an increase in intelligence . prior studies have shown an increase of up to 7.5 iq points in elementary age children who were breastfed , as well as an increase in verbal , performance and comprehensive iq in adults . the latest addition to this perspective is a long-term study of infants born in pelotas , brazil , in 1982 . published in lancet , the study interviewed 5,914 new mothers about their plans for breastfeeding and then followed up to see how they did . `` information on breastfeeding duration was collected very close to the time when weaning happened , so we had a very precise information on the duration of breastfeeding , '' said study author , dr. bernardo lessa horta , in a podcast on lancet . what makes this study unique is that it followed the subjects all the way to age 30 . `` we were able to follow about 68 % of the participants , which is a very good follow-up rate , '' said lessa horta . `` we observed that breastfeeding was positively associated with performance and intelligence at 30 years old , as well as with education , school achievement and higher monthly incomes . '' in fact , lessa horta said the subjects who had been breastfed for 12 months or longer had a higher iq -lrb- about 3.7 points -rrb- , more years of education and earned roughly 20 % more than the average income level . `` it 's suggesting that the positive effect of breastfeeding on iq leads to a higher income , '' he said . `` this is our main finding at this moment . '' one possible reason for the advantage of breast milk , lessa horta added , is that it is `` rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which are important to brain growth and development . '' called lcpufa for short , these essential fatty acids are found in salmon and shellfish and have been added to infant formulas since the 1990s . however , the benefit to mental or psychomotor development from adding lcpufa to infant formula is unclear . because the study did not measure home life , intellectual stimulation or bonding between mother and child , it was not able to tease out whether these factors may have also contributed to the increase in iq . that leaves it open to critics , such as texas a&m professor joan wolf , author of `` is breast best ? `` this study does not address the very real possibility that mothers who choose to breastfeed , regardless of income or education , distinguish themselves from those who bottle-feed in all kinds of ways that are likely to promote intelligence , '' wolf wrote cnn . for lessa horta , the implications of his study are clear : `` the finding supports the promotion of breastfeeding . it 's more evidence that besides the clear short term benefits , breastfeeding also has long term consequences in terms of human potential .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- roberto mancini says he carries manchester city 's supporters in his heart -- but there 's not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the premier league champions . manuel pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current city manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season . mancini , the man who led manchester city to its first premier league title in 44 years back in 2012 says pellegrini is `` lucky '' to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning england 's top division . pellegrini , who led city to the domestic title last season , is under fire with city trailing chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the european champions league . `` i think pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players , '' inter milan coach mancini told cnn 's don riddell on the eve of city 's crucial game with barcelona in the champions league . `` i think city can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year . '' nicknamed `` the engineer , '' pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side 's title charge in recent weeks . the chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its premier league title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow burnley last weekend . his team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night . city faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the european champions league -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $ 482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season . it must overturn a 2-1 deficit against barcelona at camp nou on wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture . only once in nine attempts has barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged champions league knockout tie and not progressed . pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at city but a number of those purchases have failed to impress . eliaquim mangala , who arrived from porto for $ 47million has endured a dismal first season in english football , while $ 32million man stevan jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from fiorentina . `` it 's my opinion that city is the best team in the premier league , '' said mancini . `` it 's in second and six points behind chelsea but i think it 's the best team . `` in the premier league anything can happen right up to the last game , in the last minute , '' perhaps a nod to city 's last gasp english premier league title win in 2012 , thanks to sergio aguero 's stoppage time winner against queens park rangers . `` i think they should think that they have a chance to win the title . '' mancini , who replaced mark hughes in december 2009 , enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure . he led the club to the fa cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season . under mancini , the club attracted star players such as yaya toure , mario balotelli , david silva and aguero . he signed a new five-year deal with the club in july 2012 but results dipped with rival manchester united regaining the league title and city suffering a shock fa cup final defeat by wigan . mancini was criticised for his side 's lack of success in the champions league , where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties . the italian , 50 , was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with carlos tevez , the argentina striker , which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the city squad . in the 12 champions league ties under his stewardship , city managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team 's failure on the european stage . at the time of his sacking , the club said that mancini failed to hit `` stated targets '' and that it wanted to `` develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football '' . `` i had a fantastic time in england , '' he added . `` we won the premier league after many years . i have all city 's supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this . `` maybe i miss the premier league because i worked there for three-and-a-half years . i built the team that is now in second position . `` i think they play with the same players and i am very proud of this .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's recent speech to the u.s. congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world : the leader of america 's most important client state in the middle east defies the reservations of the white house , abusing congress as a platform for his israeli election campaign . disregarding israel 's already strained bilateral relations with the united states , netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self-manifestation -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman . netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate israel-advocate , however , his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving israel 's national interests . political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies . netanyahu joins a long list of israeli politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion . so far he has been just another israeli leader seeking `` easy '' short-term answers to fundamentally strategic problems , thereby further protracting an already protracted conflict . as a puppet of ideological , conservative playmakers who whole-heartedly reject a two-state solution , netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of foreign minister avigdor lieberman and economy minister naftali bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain palestinian public dissidence through mere coercion . consequently , netanyahu 's foreign policy vis-à-vis the peace process has been a disaster . he took over from ehud olmert and tzipi livni -- two politicians who at least believed in a two-state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive . israeli leaders typically fall into two categories : those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace . olmert was the former , and netanyahu long seemed like he could become the latter . in reality , however , netanyahu is neither . he has given in to a toxic form of jewish nationalism , disregarded israel 's relatively good regional position vis-à-vis its otherwise-occupied arab neighbors ; he has continued to build settlements out of spite , thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the palestinians and waged a ruthless war against gaza without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation . apart from the tragic effects of netanyahu 's policy on the peace process , his stubbornness has alienated allies in europe and washington . while the arab world has been widely apathetic about the israel-palestinian issue amid regional disintegration , partners on both sides of the atlantic have tried to facilitate the revitalization of constructive peace talks . yet , netanyahu chose to ignore external initiatives , retracting to a jewish nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia , self-victimization and the illusion of israeli autarky in security and defense . as a consequence , israel 's foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled . obama 's middle eastern focus has shifted from the israel/palestinian issue to a rapprochement with iran . european lawmakers are considering recognizing palestinian statehood despite israeli objections . more importantly , many traditionally pro-israel western publics have turned their back on the jewish state . younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation : israel as the david in a fight against goliath . israel 's monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible , uncompromising short-minded policy towards a palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the west . at first sight , then , the prospect of four more years of netanyahu , does not sound too promising -- at least in regards to the peace process . at a closer look , however , a continuation of netanyahu 's policies might actually help the palestinian cause . his implicit rejection of the two-state solution ; his prioritization of short-term security over sustainable security solutions ; his pursuit of a toxic jewish nationalist agenda justifying an intensification of sectarianism between israel and the occupied territories as well as within israel , are all factors that will leave israel increasingly isolated . his israel-first narrative might win netanyahu votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right-wing amid a top-down constructed climate of fear . hamas ' and hezbollah 's mid-tech missile capability , syria 's socio-political disintegration and subsequent rise of islamist non-state actors , have been used by the netanyahu government to create an arab bogyman ostensibly threatening the jewish state 's very existence -- a new bogyman coexisting side-by-side with netanyahu 's `` favorite '' bogeyman , iran . despite netanyahu 's pre-occupation with security , the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far . if netanyahu receives another mandate on tuesday , israel will be further driven into the international offside , pressure from the west will increase and thereby the palestinian cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and publics across the world . netanyahu has become somewhat of a villain in the west -- an untrustworthy , short-sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in ramallah appears to lack the willingness to compromise , cooperate and empathize . thus , while another term of bibi will not be in the national interest of israel , it will very likely serve the palestinian interests .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- tunisia 's ultra-radical fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 arab spring revolutions . wednesday 's attack on the bardo museum in tunis was grimly predictable , coming from what the tunisian interior ministry calls a violent ultra-radical islamist fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services . jihadist firebrands representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on tunisia 's outward-looking , investment-friendly majority . the attack was carried out by two gunmen , believed to have been supported by at least two accomplices . it may torpedo efforts to revive tunisia 's employment-generating tourism industry and may discourage other big-spending visitors . it will probably lead tunisians -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected president beji caid essebsi . the attack adds to the global narrative by which islamic revolutionaries -- increasingly flying under the flag of the so-called islamic state -lrb- isis -rrb- -- pose an existential crisis to moderate states , often western allies , in the arab world . tunisia is the sole country to have emerged from an arab spring revolution with its political process intact -- current president , essebsi , who was elected in november 2014 , and his ruling coalition , are the products of a long constitutional process . in four tumultuous years they have competed hard with , but also showed a capacity to work with , opposition parties , led by the `` moderate islamist '' ennahda , which is represented in government and parliament . islamists of a very different hue were responsible for the bardo attack . local salafist groups -lrb- of whom the best known is ansar al-sharia -rrb- as well as multinational units including isis have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young tunisians in the capital 's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior , where the original revolution that removed ben ali in february 2011 surged up . legitimate claims for more jobs and resources in these underprivileged areas during the four subsequent years have largely come to nothing , adding to frustrations . radical jihadists -- some with back bases in libya and algeria -- have posed a major security challenge to successive governments , murdering two prominent `` secular '' politicians in 2013 . the tunisian armed forces , supported by algeria 's more experienced and better equipped military , have been fighting jihadist radicals in the mount chaambi region for nearly three years . they have yet to declare final victory , pointing to the resilience of underground groups . while successive governments have acted against radical salafist groups , thousands of tunisians have gone underground ; they are widely believed to make up the biggest national group fighting with jihadists in syria -lrb- over 3,000 by many accounts -rrb- , and are present in libya and other failing states . in january 2013 , tunisians and libyans made up the majority of jihadists who attacked a strategic gas plant operated by bp and statoil in southern algeria . so , the bardo attackers are a known enemy . prime minister habib essid has promised a robust security response . but the tunis tragedy is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the political process . a majority of tunisians remain foursquare behind preserving `` republican institutions , '' even if they vocally disagree on the detail of policy . it will remind tunisia 's many friends that the country 's transition is brittle , and that tunis needs commitments of support to become reality , with more military and wider financial assistance , and , above all , investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011 . massacre at the bardo places tunisia more centrally within the global isis narrative , which has recently expanded to neighboring libya . it is a ghastly way to remind the world that tunisia 's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- december 16 , 2014 was a dark day , not just in our nation 's history , but the world 's . young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in peshawar along with their teachers . it shook a nation that had already seen more than 55,000 of its innocent civilians die in the hands of terrorism in the last 10 years , to a whole new level . naturally , i was in no less despair . hailing from a humble background , where both my parents have served in the field of education their entire lives , the strong emphasis on education in our house was probably another reason why this incident had affected me so deeply . read more : bloodstains , bullet holes mark peshawar classrooms . i canceled my tours and concerts and could n't gather myself to do much in coming weeks . however , being an artist , i had to express myself ; even more so because i have always believed that an artist should be more than a tool for his art to resonate through . he must also resonate the voice of his surroundings by being socially aware and strive to contribute to his environment for the better in whatever little or large manner that he decides for himself . i thought that each one of us needed to wake up to this call and help and inspire the other to do more for our future . so i picked up the phone and started calling all my colleagues from film , fashion , tv and music . i was pleasantly surprised that all of them agreed with my initiative and came on board without a second thought on such a short notice . we all got together because we all want a progressive , peaceful , tolerant and positive pakistan . and the response to the song and video further solidified my belief that every pakistani wants the same . they just need someone to show them the way . and to me , education is the way forward . it 's the the key to progress and peace . i also feel that there is a lot more to pakistan than what the world gets to see . pakistan is a beautiful land with beautiful people who -- like those in any other nation -- want to live in harmony with themselves and the world . a place where people sing , dance and play . unfortunately because of an extremist minority , it is sometimes seen as an extremist country . but no society is void of extremism in one way or the other . this is something that we all need to work towards -- the international community and us . pakistan needs your help . it has been fighting this battle for years and lost countless lives in the process . its economy has also suffered . the world needs to see pakistan in a whole different light to help us out of this darkness . they need to partner with us towards progress . they need to understand the complexities of this society and the fact that it 's not easy to survive through all that this country has been through . today the entire nation stands as one for this cause . and that is what i have tried to show the world in this video . a pakistan that stands united to make sure that the lives of those innocent children did not go to waste . i also did n't want this to be just a song . i wanted to practically help towards a cause dear to me -- education . so , i collaborated with a leading pakistani educational non-profit organization , the citizens foundation -lrb- tcf -rrb- and 141schools . org -lrb- 141 schools -rrb- , a new citizen web movement . together , they are building 141 schools across pakistan . each school will be dedicated to the children and teachers who lost their lives in attack on december 16 , 2014 . all proceeds from the downloads of the song will go towards building schools for the children of pakistan and ensuring a bright future . i aspire to build at least one school which would cost around 20.7 million pkr -lrb- $ 202,900 -rrb- . if you want to help , click here .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` captain america '' actor chris evans met some `` true superheroes '' on saturday at seattle children 's hospital in a visit with `` guardians of the galaxy '' star chris pratt . it was their second hospital visit as part of a super bowl bet that ended in a win for everyone . the bet : if pratt 's team -- the seattle seahawks -- won the super bowl , evans would visit seattle children 's hospital dressed as captain america . if evans ' team -- the new england patriots -- won , pratt would visit christopher 's haven in boston dressed as `` guardians of the galaxy '' character star-lord , wearing patriots quarterback tom brady 's jersey . even though the patriots won , the two chrises visited both hospitals . pratt wore his star-lord costume to visit boston children 's hospital in february , and evans donned his captain america duds to visit seattle children 's on saturday , bearing gifts in the form of marvel action figures and accessories . `` meeting captain america and star-lord is an experience our patients will always remember , '' seattle children 's said . `` the kids were beyond excited to meet captain america and star-lord .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the midst of all the shouting over indiana 's new religious-freedom law , which many fear will lead to increased discrimination against lgbt people , culture warriors marked the grim anniversary of another conservative `` victory , '' one that left more than 10,000 needy children without their pledged financial support . a year ago this week , i rose each morning with red , puffy eyes and heavy sense of exhaustion . i had n't slept soundly since march 26 , a day many of my friends and readers mark as the last day they wanted anything to do with organized christianity . it all started when world vision , a humanitarian organization i had long supported and promoted , announced a change to its hiring policy allowing people in same-sex marriages to work in its u.s. offices . in response , conservative evangelicals rallied , and within 72 hours , more than 10,000 children had lost their financial support from canceled world vision sponsorships . ten-thousand children . in addition , funding for schools , hospitals , water projects , and medical care was threatened as churches vowed to cut off support to an organization that hired lgbt people . as one of my readers , anthony , recalls , `` our church leadership vowed that they would pull all support , including over $ 2 million to build two hospitals in zambia . '' to try and stem some of the bleeding , i joined with other world vision bloggers to encourage my readers to sponsor children or make one-time donations to the organization . we had raised several thousand dollars and multiple sponsorships -- many coming from gay and lesbian couples -- when the ceo of world vision announced the charity would reverse its decision and return to its old policies discriminating against gay and lesbian employees . it had worked . using wells and hospitals and child sponsorships as bargaining chips in the culture wars had actually worked . never in my life had i been so angry at my own faith tradition . many conservative evangelicals count the world vision reversal as a major victory in the culture wars . eric teetsel , director of the manhattan declaration , told christianity today he considered it `` the best news of 2014 '' for evangelical christians . `` this was christianity at its best , '' he said . but as i survey the battlefield a year later , i ca n't help but wonder if even the most strident culture warriors would consider the world vision campaign worth its many casualties . there are , of course , the families around the world affected by the sudden drying up of funds meant to support their hospitals and schools , not to mention the kids who used to receive letters and gifts from their sponsors , but whose pictures were casually ripped from the refrigerator and tossed into the garbage can once they were deemed expendable collateral in an american political battle . then there are the many gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people , -lrb- especially lgbt christians caught in the middle -rrb- , for whom the campaign represented yet another blow to their humanity . i remember a gay friend of mine telling me , through tears , `` christians do n't even think i 'm worthy of answering phones in the office of a humanitarian organization . what makes them think i would be welcome in their churches ? '' and then there are the many christians and former christians for whom the world vision campaign was the final straw in a drawn-out disillusionment with organized religion . when i marked the anniversary with a facebook status on the topic , i was surprised by how many of my readers marked march 26 as the day they left the church . `` i do n't think i can ever get over this , '' wrote kelly . `` changed my views on evangelicalism and my faith forever . '' anthony , who once taught sunday school at his church , only rarely attends now . this is the tragic irony of the culture wars : the casualties tend to be the very people jesus went out of his way to serve : the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the outcasts , the people ostracized and deemed `` sinners '' by the religious elite . and when the world sees christians hurting rather than helping such people , in the name of political gain , our testimony is profoundly diminished . we have lost the way of jesus when we are more committed to self-preservation than service , more occupied with waging war than washing feet . in all likelihood , indiana 's religious-freedom law will not directly affect many people . but the conversation that has surrounded it , in which discrimination against lgbt people has been characterized as a `` deeply held religious belief , '' will have far more lasting effects , not unlike the effects of the campaign against world vision . so to the culture warriors , i plead : before you wage the next campaign , assess the potential collateral damage and ask yourself if it 's worth it . remember that the fruit of the spirit is not power or might , influence or entitlement . the fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , gentleness , and self control , and `` against such things , there is no law '' -lrb- galatians 5:23 -rrb- . and to the wounded , i offer only this : you are not alone . please know there are field medics -- pastors and priests , artists and activists , poets and parents and healers and dreamers -- ready to welcome you back to faith and to church whenever you 're ready . we can walk the long road to healing together , even if it 's with a limp .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the debate over health care reform once again blooms in d.c. , but this time democrats and the president whose legacy rests on the affordable care act are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species . the gop has kicked off its season by pulling obamacare up by the roots in its proposed 2016 house budget . but this budget will not become law . and so republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the supreme court rules in their favor this summer , or if a republican wins the white house next year backed by complementary majorities in the house and senate . either scenario would mortally wound obamacare . but this is n't a zero sum game . smart republicans already know they do n't win just because the other side loses . upending obamacare may poison the gop 's standing with 16.4 million americans who will face adverse , even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law , or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy . this week , the conservative weekly the washington examiner aimed to mark obamacare 's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to `` reform , replace or restart '' the law . a gas leak scuttled the event . once they 've regrouped for their next panel , republicans should instead entertain a different r : revise . so far every plan republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance , which , oddly for a party celebrating self-reliance , encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others . many of the gop plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low-income americans with tax credits . tax credits do n't make much sense when you do n't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place . these alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key obamacare principle of providing guaranteed access . to date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured americans by a whopping 35 % . sen. ted cruz , r-texas , lifted his veil even during his own plan 's debut by insisting `` every last word of obamacare must be repealed '' while promoting his own health care choices act that ditches subsidies and the mandate . republican presidential front-runner jeb bush shares cruz 's preference to dismantle the `` monstrosity '' altogether , describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills . and besides repealing the aca , house budget committee chairman tom price , r-georgia , wants to tear into president lyndon johnson 's great society achievements as well . his budget proposal dismantles the federal medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states , while asking seniors on medicare to try their luck with a voucher-discounted private insurance . what these approaches do n't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it , yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege . the beating heart of obamacare is its mandate to purchase health insurance , which keeps costs down for everyone , makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions , and makes government subsidies possible for those who ca n't afford any insurance without them . if republicans shift their focus to revising obamacare , there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull , and they can expect many democrats to join in the work . but after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 republican attempts to kill the bill , democrats ca n't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything . but there are some places to look . even aca supporters can acknowledge some specific anti-competitive features in the law . this should interest republicans . the aca 's push toward offloading risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation , with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk this trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition . meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few in-network hospitals and physicians , again making the health care marketplace less competitive . the united states may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world , centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training . but going out of state to seek such care is n't an option for many patients on exchange plans . cruz proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally , an idea that we should build on . years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high copays , deductibles , and out-of-pocket maximums that obamacare uses as a cost-control measure . among families making 250 % to 400 % over the federal poverty line , 55 % to 68 % ca n't make their deductible , depending on their plan . the numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold , and even for families making over 400 % of the poverty line , 25 % to 38 % ca n't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill . despite these costs , the aca penalizes responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts . furthermore , obamacare is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for `` free , '' yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run . that 's not the most rational distribution of funds if we 're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost . since jeb bush is interested in focusing on the big-ticket items and not sweating the small stuff , perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support . obamacare is n't a work of art by any means . it 's a messy , pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of americans want : access to affordable health care when it 's needed . some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead , like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed essential health benefits it covers . so , my advice to republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of obamacare they 'd like to improve , let 's have the policy debate , then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law , leaving its beating heart intact . show you 're open to constructively improving the aca and i 'm sure we 'll see democrats start coming to the table with their own pet peeves about the law . 2016 does n't have to be a hyperbolic , hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million americans .
new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- kayla mueller , peter kassig , alan henning , david haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by isis in the past year . the exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown ; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive . what we do know is isis holds at least one female aid worker , and possibly more . the international federation of the red cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in october 2013 remain missing , but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them . abductions and killings of aid workers are , unfortunately , nothing new , but the numbers are . according to aidworkersecurity.org , at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013 , a 121 % increase on 70 recorded killings the year before . not all were victims of isis , a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled syria . in fact , according to the same report , it is the taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers , in large part in afghanistan . here 's the difference : isis is changing the game . the taliban may have many reasons for abductions -lrb- flexing their muscles , negotiating prisoner releases -rrb- , but they also have a record of frequent hostage release . the need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters , or mattered . for isis , it appears to matter less . abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income -lrb- isis demanded at least $ 6 million for kayla mueller , and reportedly $ 200 million for two japanese hostages -rrb- or , failing that , their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness . so far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by isis is extremely low , save for those whose ransoms were paid . the freeing of 19 kidnapped assyrian christians shocked many , because release is not a common part of isis ' playbook . these tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide , who may look to emulate isis ' model of abduction and violence . one example is west african extremist group boko haram , which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies , an approach disturbingly similar to isis ' . `` humanitarian work has always been risky , but it 's never been more dangerous than it is now , '' says caryl stern , president and ceo of the u.s. fund for unicef . `` there used to be a time when an organization 's flag provided a great deal of protection . that 's no longer the case . '' the response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of syria and its environs altogether , but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers . still , outside workers like mueller , kassig , henning and haines were inside syria when they were taken , and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations . not only that , but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency , local staffers become bait . indeed , the majority of victims have been working in their own countries . isis does n't just target aid workers . journalists , soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list . but in the wild west that is syria and its borders , few of these remain , save for aid workers . in a space devoid of government , refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities , the new front line in the war on terror , a sometimes unwelcome association . and as isis spreads beyond syria 's borders , the risks grow further afield . yet despite these risks , thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the u.n. high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million . while some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection , many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit . their security and locations for the most part are under constant review . when cnn approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences , and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level , many declined , in large part due to security concerns . for this reason , some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous . if i think back , i 've been doing this work for about 20 years , and i remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection , some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much , much more difficult ; we 're asking people to put themselves in harm 's way in some circumstances . i mean , we do n't do that , but it 's not the exception any more . my family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry , i worry about them and that does n't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work . i 'm very selective about where i say i go . i need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that 's here , not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people i 'm responsible for in this region . i do n't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one , two , three times -- who do n't see a future for their children ... someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security , and i mean that in the personal sense of a mother who , when she goes to sleep at night with her children , she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day . fear is always there in the back of everyone 's mind . we just need to continue what we 're doing , stopping is not an option , halting our operations is not an option , and we are taking great risks , our staff are taking great risks . it is a difficult thing to tell family , to tell colleagues . oftentimes i just do n't mention all the details of where i go because they just do n't need to know . but it needs to be done , we also ca n't run an operation remotely . ... i 'm not going to the front lines , i 'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we 're not adrenaline driven people . we want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks , but it 's about calculated risks . we do n't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger . if we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security , morale , pressure from here , pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place . there 's not going to be another organization that 's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that iocc may create , that 's not going to happen . so that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization ; we feel that responsibility that we 've got to deliver on this thing . donate to iocc . there 's an internal motivation that keeps you going . you feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance , and know it 's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service . so yes , you need be of course strong , motivated , passionate , and of course feel the need to assist and deliver . it 's an unprecedented time , and what we 're calling the new normal ... as we 've seen in the last year , the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups , who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we 're not the u.s. army , we do n't have a physical ability to repel . there may be in people 's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance : like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car , you 'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community . i think that golden age is more myth than reality , but regarding today 's reality it 's extremely dangerous it 's so true . and your flag , your neutrality , your white car , all the good intention you have , that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies . there 's a phrase that the u.n. uses and a lot of ngos use which is `` stay and deliver , '' so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there , but we always have to be in a risk management role ; we have to critically look at : do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get ? the fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends , and that has more of a toll , i think , with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly , sometimes i do n't tell them till i 'm already on my way so i do n't have to have those calls before i even get on an airplane . it 's hard ; there are some areas where the family and friends do n't understand why you 're going there , and you re-articulate , `` if not you , then who ? '' and you ask , `` would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened ?

london -lrb- cnn -rrb- best-selling british fantasy author terry pratchett has died at the age of 66 , his website said thursday . pratchett , who wrote more than 70 books , including those in his `` discworld '' series , had been diagnosed with a rare form of alzheimer 's disease in 2007 . a statement on the website announced the news of his death at home thursday with `` immeasurable sadness . '' `` i was deeply saddened to learn that sir terry pratchett has died . the world has lost one of its brightest , sharpest minds , '' said larry finlay , managing director at transworld publishers . `` in over 70 books , terry enriched the planet like few before him . as all who read him know , ` discworld ' was his vehicle to satirize this world : he did so brilliantly , with great skill , enormous humor and constant invention . '' pratchett continued to write following his diagnosis , completing his last book , a new discworld novel , in the summer of 2014 . revealing his illness in 2007 , the author -- who had a strong following among fans of fantasy fiction -- said he had been diagnosed with `` a very rare form of early onset alzheimer 's , '' which he described as `` an embuggerance . '' he said then , `` frankly , i would prefer it if people kept things cheerful , because i think there 's time for at least a few more books yet . '' according to thursday 's statement , he had posterior cortical atrophy , a progressive degenerative condition involving the loss and dysfunction of brain cells , particularly at the back of the brain . the last posts on his verified twitter account , run by pratchett with close friend rob wilkins , give a poignant farewell -- and have already been retweeted thousands of times . `` at last , sir terry , we must walk together , '' the first tweet in the series reads -- an apparent reference to death , a recurring and generally sympathetic character in the discworld books , who always speaks in all caps . `` terry took death 's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night . `` the end . '' jeremy hughes , chief executive of the alzheimer 's society , a charitable organization , said pratchett -- who spoke out publicly about his condition and called for greater funding for alzheimer 's research -- had `` fundamentally changed the way dementia is seen and understood . '' `` his vehement determination to reduce the stigma of dementia meant he helped drag it out of the shadows -- kicking and screaming at times , '' he said . `` shouting from the rooftops about the absurdity of how little funding dementia research receives , and fighting for good quality dementia care , he was and will remain the truest of champions for people with the condition . '' pratchett was also a patron of the british humanist association , which paid tribute thursday to the humor and dedication with which the author `` turned his suffering into a positive campaign . '' pratchett , who began writing while a provincial newspaper journalist in the 1960s , became a full time writer in 1987 and received the order of the british empire `` for services to literature '' from prince charles in 1998 . people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's bharati naik contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the sack and pillage of the mosul museum by the so-called islamic state of iraq and syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the buddhas of bamyian . the bulldozing of the archaeological site of nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in iraq . these acts are a deliberate attack against civilians , minorities , heritage sites and traditions . in the minds of terrorists , murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked . it is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization , whose temples , palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of iraq and mesopotamia for the last 3,000 years . it is important we understand the true nature of this conflict . this war against culture is a war against people . it is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression . this is why extremists attack schools , media , or other places of culture . through modern methods of communication and information , they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds . they forbid girls to go to school , kill journalists and vandalize museums : all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity . there can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity , and i wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion . when culture is under attack , we must respond with more knowledge , and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity 's shared heritage . this is why we appeal to all cultural institutions , museums , journalists , professors , and scientists to share knowledge widely about the mesopotamian civilization . we need to remind all of the history of this land which led the islamic golden age . and we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth , in iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own . pre-islamic heritage in iraq belongs to all iraqis , just as the pyramids are written into the identity of all egyptians . what is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the `` irreparable loss of treasures of humanity . '' what is happening is a security issue . the deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime . we see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations , spread terror , and encourage violence . we see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted sites , and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism . with this in mind , we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes . the acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action . faced with such crimes , we hope we can better understand the values we all share , and stand united in respect of humanity .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson city manager john shaw resigned tuesday in the wake of a scathing justice department report . the report blames ferguson , missouri , police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets african-american residents . `` over the last several months i have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community , '' shaw wrote in his resignation letter . he continued : `` during this time i have also worked closely with the department of justice to identify opportunities to improve , and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change . `` and while i certainly respect the work that the doj recently performed in their investigation and report on the city of ferguson , i must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target african americans , nor falsify charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor . any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false . '' shaw 's resignation was announced the same day the city council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with shaw . residents elect city council members , who in turn appoint the city manager . the city manager directs and supervises all city departments , including the police department . along with other officials , shaw was heavily criticized by the justice department report , which found that authorities in ferguson frequently saw residents as `` sources of revenue . '' in fact , the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said . in one march 2012 email , the captain of the patrol division reported to shaw that court collections the previous month reached $ 235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $ 200,000 . the city manager reported the email to the city council , congratulating police and court staff on their `` great work , '' the report said . when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million for the whole of 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : `` awesome ! thanks ! '' according to the federal report . the doj 's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager michael brown , who was shot by ferguson police officer darren wilson in august . wilson , who was not indicted on any charges , has resigned from the police department . but when ferguson resident sue schmidt defended wilson at tuesday 's city council meeting , she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd . `` i 'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe darren wilson an apology , '' schmidt said , prompting laughter by some in the audience . `` the same justice report that you 're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100 % .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's playing out like a scene from `` night of the living dead '' -- in the boardroom of one of italy 's most famous clubs . director george a. romero 's horror cult classic revolved around a swarm of slow-moving cannibalistic corpses snacking on the inhabitants of a shopping mall and parma general manager and team legend alessandro melli talks in similarly apocalyptic tones as he details the financial crisis engulfing the serie a club . `` it seems like we are zombies , working without knowing where we are heading , '' melli told cnn 's don riddell . rooted at the bottom of italy 's top flight , parma has debts of approximately $ 100 million and faces a looming financial collapse -- barring a miracle ownership rescue . the club has been docked points twice this season for failing to pay its players and faces a bankruptcy hearing on march 19 . `` every day they take away a part of our work and piece of our hearts . bits of the club are foreclosed every day and we come here to work just because we love our work and our team , but we can not do our job , '' added melli . `` we 're living in a nightmare , whichever way you look at it . because this is not just about the money , even though we ca n't ignore it , there is a lot more that they are taking away . dignity , the smile ; they took away our respect and it hurts . '' last season parma finished sixth in serie a , only to be barred from taking part in european football 's second tier competition -- the europa league -- over an income tax bill . between 1992 and 2002 parma won two uefa cups , the 1992 european cup winners ' cup and three italian cups in a successful spell between 1992 and 2002 . in 1997 , led by current real madrid coach carlo ancelotti and with the caliber of players like gianfranco zola , faustino asprilla and hernan crespo , parma finished runners-up in serie a. `` look at the team we had , '' said angelo manfredini , president of the parma supporters club , referring to those halycon days , as he rattled off other players including melli , fabio cannavaro and longtime italy captain and goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , who now plays for juventus . `` all were players who meant something to football . '' fast forward to more austere times and parma 's current players have n't been paid since august . they 're so fed up they 've threatened to go on strike -- that is if the games are allowed proceed in the first place , with two of parma 's recent fixtures having been called off given the club 's problems . parma was once owned by the world 's leading dairy company , parmalat spa , which collapsed under financial fraud in 2003 . the club has already changed hands twice this season after a russian-cypriot conglomerate sold the club to giampietro manenti . a despairing melli depicted a club that is being seemingly taken apart seat by seat , screw by screw . `` one day , we wo n't have the laundry anymore , '' said melli . `` the next day , computers -lrb- will be -rrb- taken away , then we do n't have emails anymore . `` and then the physical objects related to sport , like benches , like the team bus ... everyday it 's like being stabbed . '' for his part , manenti has reportedly said he will not sell the club , which will likely mean another spell in administration for parma , the second time in the past 10 years . their next scheduled match is a home game on march 22 against torino , but melli is more concerned about what the future holds in store for parma rather than the next 90 minutes . `` i hope to have a new owner to sort out our debts and save the brand , starting again from serie b and to start again with new management that loves what they are managing , '' said melli . `` slowly , we can rebuild . it will take time and patience , with the right people in the right places . only in this way can parma be reborn like a phoenix . `` objectively , it 's unlikely this will happen . this is just the hope of a lover , trying to find his lost love . but he needs the help of others , we ca n't make it by ourselves .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- brace yourself europe -- `` moneyball '' is coming to a football pitch near you . spend-thrift baseball executive billy beane -- made famous by brad pitt 's oscar-nominated portrayal in `` moneyball '' -- is taking up a position with dutch club az alkmaar . `` i 'm truly excited for the opportunity to be part of az alkmaar in an advisory role , '' beane told the az website . `` despite being a great football club with a storied history , they face many of the challenges we have with the oakland a 's . my love for football and az 's vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit . '' the idea behind `` moneyball '' is to obtain maximum value for each player bought or sold . beane has had a longstanding fascination with european football , citing arsenal 's arsene wenger as a manager he admires for his blend of performance on the pitch and financial prudence . the american has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended . it turns out he did n't have to wait that long . `` i think it 's interesting and exciting for him personally , '' said chris anderson , co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy anderson sally . `` he 's been a football fan for many , many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry . this is not as much a stretch as one might imagine ; he actually knows football . '' beane will retain his general manager duties with the oakland a 's , a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest payrolls in major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- . the a 's have qualified for mlb 's playoffs each of the past three seasons , only to be knocked out before the world series every time . critics of baseball 's sabermetrics system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in michael lewis ' `` moneyball '' book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that beane has never won a title with the a 's . in holland , beane wo n't need to start from scratch , as az currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the dutch eredivisie . az 's director of football earnie stewart is a known `` moneyball '' fan himself , having organized a screening for his fellow az execs shortly after joining the club . the former u.s. midfielder , who scored against colombia in the 1994 world cup , is half-dutch and hopes the collaboration with beane can give the club an extra edge . `` we 've had a lot of contact with billy in the last few months '' , stewart told the club 's website . `` his knowledge and ideas are impressive . also billy 's soccer network is excellent . we have already noticed that billy thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation . that 's what really connects with the ambitions of az. '' like the a 's , az have managed to compete with the big boys of the dutch league -- chiefly psv and ajax -- on a limited budget , winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons . beane 's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market . `` there is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody , but that is not true at all , '' beane told the telegraph in 2011 . `` you want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying . that may come in the form of a very expensive player , it may come in the form of a very young player , but it 's not about being cheap or not spending money . '' but it 's questionable whether `` moneyball '' principles can be applied to football , a sport where -- unlike in u.s. sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another . instead , athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace , untethered by salary caps . however , anderson argues beane could be about to exploit a gap in the market . `` i would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball , '' said anderson , who also wrote `` the numbers game : everything you know about football is wrong . '' `` the combination of a global market plus inefficiency means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there is n't in the same way in baseball . '' either way , beane is likely to relish the challenge of imparting his knowledge to the boardrooms of european football , perhaps even as a pre-cursor to a full time job in the sport . `` i think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role , '' said anderson , adding that beane could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the shark-infested waters of football player transfers . `` in football we 're still in a pre - ` moneyball ' era , '' added anderson . `` so the baseball equivalent of the mid-1990s . is the football equivalent of 2015 . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- they say time and tide wait for no man , as henrik stenson discovered at the arnold palmer invitational in florida when he complained he had been decisively rushed after being put on the clock in the closing stages of his dramatic defeat . the swede -- who lost to defending champion matt every by one stroke -- was ticked off that he and playing partner morgan hoffman were subjected to time constraints from the 15th hole onwards because of alleged slow play sunday . under competition rules , players are put on the clock if they have fallen behind the allotted time for each hole and well behind the preceding group of players . once the measure is imposed , shots are timed and players given a one-stroke penalty for the second shot -- but not the first -- on which they are found to have taken too long . stenson said the decision `` got to me , and obviously i was rushing '' as he three-putted both that hole and the 16th , opening the door for floridian every to seal the title with a round of 66 crowned by a long-range putt on the final green . officials at the bay hill course said stenson and hoffmann 's had been the slowest pairing of the day sunday . but the frustrated 38-year-old swede said he `` could not see the point '' of being put on the clock . `` when someone is sitting there with a stopwatch it affects you a little bit , '' he explained , accusing officials of `` influencing , potentially , the outcome of this tournament towards the end . '' `` i did n't really have much time to look at my putt -lsb- on the 15th -rsb- and rushed that one a little bit , the first one , and three-putted , '' the pga tour website quoted him as saying . `` morgan got a bad time on his second shot on 16 , and again i kind of rushed my putting on 16 and three-putted that one . that 's really what cost me the tournament , those two three-putts on 15 and 16 . `` we might have been a couple minutes out , for sure -- but then again it 's normally not the quickest when you 're playing in the last group . '' -lsb- there are -rsb- more people , more movement . you have to back off every now and then for some mobile phones and stuff like that . '' the pga tour was not immediately available for comment about stenson 's remarks . stenson told reporters that `` it 's hard when you do n't feel like you can take the time you want , '' adding that he was `` disappointed with the rules official for pushing us up late in the round for no obvious reason . '' and he was unimpressed when told that part of the reason for the imposition of the ticking clock could have been a desire to complete play before live tv coverage came to an end at 18.00 local time . `` i thought we were here to play golf , not to finish at 6pm , '' he snapped . meanwhile , a delighted every was left to reflect on the 17ft birdie putt on the final green that took him to the title . `` you watch tournaments on tv where guys make putts like that to win and everybody goes nuts -- it 's cool to close one out like that , '' he said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- with his kiss makeup on , frontman gene simmons always looked a little scary . so maybe this new venture makes sense . the rocker and reality-show star is teaming with wwe studios to launch erebus pictures , a label that will finance and produce horror movies . the joint venture kicks off with a three-picture deal starting with `` temple , '' expected to begin shooting this summer . `` the horror genre continues to fascinate me as it proves to be endlessly thrilling and engaging for audiences , '' said simmons , who with kiss has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide . erebus pictures is named after the greek mythological deity that personifies darkness . it has a logical marketing platform in the wwe network , a subscription-based streaming service known for pro-wrestling shows such as `` monday night raw '' and `` smackdown '' that appeal to primarily young male fans , arguably the core of the horror-movie audience . wwe says `` temple '' is about a team of highly trained operatives who find themselves trapped inside an isolated military compound after its artificial intelligence is suddenly shut down . while investigating the source of the malfunction , the crew begins to experience strange and horrific phenomena as they try to uncover who or what killed the team previously stationed at the compound . the studio says a director for `` temple '' will be announced shortly . erebus pictures ' second feature will go into production later this year . wwe studios ' most lucrative film has been `` the call , '' a 2013 thriller starring halle berry , which earned $ 68 million worldwide .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- wildlife services in california are being pushed to their limits this year . since january 2015 , every month has set a record in sea lion `` strandings , '' mostly sea lion pups , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . `` there has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since january , '' said justin greenman , assistant stranding coordinator for noaa on the west coast . `` stranding does happen , but just to give you perspective , 1,800 -lsb- sea lion -rsb- pups have been responded to this year alone . we responded to 1,600 strandings total during the entire year in 2013 , '' he said . stranding is the official term to describe marine life that `` swim or float into shore and become beached or stuck , '' according to noaa . strandings are taking a toll on the resources available in coastal counties from san diego to santa barbara . local care facilities have taken in more stranded sea lions this year than 2004-12 combined , and it is only mid-march . greenman said he expects the problem to continue beyond april , when weaning normally occurs , when the pups are 10 or 11 months old . dave koontz , director of communications for seaworld san diego , said seaworld has rescued nearly 500 sea lions this year . `` this is a new record for sea world , '' koontz said . `` in 1983 we rescued 474 . '' some of the sea lions responded to have had to be euthanized . `` they -lsb- sea lion pups -rsb- have to be able to eat and fish on their own before they can be released back into the wild , and a lot of these pups have n't even been weaned , '' greenman said . greenman said california has had warmer weather than usual this year , and , while noaa is still conducting studies on the channel islands to get a more proven explanation , warmer water drives the food source farther out or deeper into the ocean , where the colder water is . when food is farther away , the mothers are away from the pup too long in search of food , and return with little food or too few nutrients for a growing sea lion . `` we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , '' greenman said . however , he said , the species has made a comeback since the marine mammal protection act of 1972 . california 's sea lion population has grown to 300,000 from an estimated population of 10,000 in the 1950s , according to the washington department of fish & wildlife . people who observe stranded sea lions are advised not to touch them or attempt to rescue them , because it can be dangerous and it is illegal . instead , call any of the rescue agencies listed on noaa west coast region 's website . if the animal has died , the local dead animal pickup service should be alerted .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- spirit airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes . the low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $ 69 round-trip fares in april and may that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply . round-trip purchase is not required , so you could actually pay $ 34.50 for a one-way flight . but the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy , which obliquely references a sexual act . `` we 've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years , '' reads the offer on spirit 's website . `` it 's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother 's bed -lrb- the one with the fantastic articles -rrb- . use your mouth to spread the word : spirit is in an even better position to get you where you 're going . '' some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste . `` you ca n't object to that price point , but you certainly can object to the discount airline 's marketing strategy , which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if spirit 's website was hacked , '' wrote aaron rupar of kmsp in minneapolis . spirit spokesman paul berry , in a prepared statement , said the promotion reflects the airline 's quirky culture . `` spirit is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be . we enjoy being different than other airlines , '' said berry , spirit 's director of corporate communications . `` when it comes to advertising , different means we do n't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares . but we 're also different because our ads are fun , provocative , sometimes silly and often irreverent . they get lots of attention , '' he added . `` the vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are . we understand there is a small group of people who feel differently . '' the $ 69 fares must be booked by the end of the day tuesday . questionable taste or not , the promotion may be working : people were complaining on twitter that they could n't access spirit 's website to book flights . based in florida , spirit airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can . the airline 's defense is simple : pay for what you want on your flight , and do n't pay for what you do n't want . airline plans $ 15 flights to europe .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in tennis , a hitting partner is someone who often does more than just practice with a big star . they sometimes have to be psychologists , waiters , chauffeurs and even bodyguards . they may get to travel the world but the job is n't without its perils . two years ago , for example , the father of bernard tomic , one of the most hyped players in the last decade , was found guilty of assaulting the player 's former hitting partner , thomas drouet . now , one of the longest lasting relationships -- and one of the highest profile -- has come to an end . sascha bajin , a constant in serena williams ' life the past eight years , suggested on twitter earlier this week that he was no longer working with the 19-time grand slam winner and has instead begun a partnership with williams ' friend and tennis rival , victoria azarenka . williams wished him well . their split was confirmed by williams ' agent , jill smoller , in an email to cnn.com , and azarenka 's coach , wim fissette , confirmed that bajin is indeed the two-time grand slam champion 's new hitting partner . they practiced together for the first time this week . `` i 'm very excited about having sascha in the team , '' fissette told cnn.com in an email . `` sascha is a great guy ... and has so much experience in working with serena . `` i saw sascha hit many times so i know he is just a very good tennis player . to give the player the best rhythm is extremely important . `` on the other hand i think it 's very good there is someone else in the team with experience winning grand slams . that 's always very important . sascha knows what it is like to be in semifinals and finals in grand slams . '' no one has disclosed what led to the parting of ways but bajin was n't with williams as she won the australian open in january . bajin said he was injured , with frenchman jonathan dasnieres de veigy replacing him . fissette , who was formerly alongside kim clijsters , simona halep and sabine lisicki when they either won or reached grand slam finals , said he was `` very surprised '' that bajin became available . `` sascha was working so many years with serena and i felt they had an excellent relationship , more than just player and hitting partner , '' he said . `` i felt they were very good friends . `` but it 's not my business to know what went wrong . maybe they both needed a new challenge . i think everybody will remember the many years they worked together and the excellent results she had during that time . '' williams , about to make her return to indian wells after a 14-year absence , once likened bajin to a brother . `` outside of my parents , i think he 's probably the most important person on the team , '' williams told usa today in 2013 . `` he 's much more than a hitting partner . he 's my older brother . he 's family .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the university of north carolina will pay whistleblower mary willingham $ 335,000 to settle her lawsuit with the university , following the largest academic fraud scandal in ncaa history . willingham is the former athletics literacy counselor who blew the whistle about the fake classes that went on for nearly 20 years at the prestigious university . willingham spent years fielding attacks from university officials -- including accusations that she was lying when she said that officials within the athletic department steered underprepared athletes into the fake classes to keep them eligible . for nearly five years , unc denied those claims , but willingham refused to keep quiet . she first told her story to the news & observer in raleigh , and then to national media when the university refused to admit that the classes were well-known to faculty . the added attention forced unc to hire a new investigator and launch a new probe in 2014 . that latest review , led by ken wainstein , a 19-year veteran of the u.s. justice department , found exactly what willingham had always claimed -- widespread and systematic cheating . willingham left her job last spring after complaining that she was being retaliated against . `` the university 's settlement with mrs. willingham resolves all of the outstanding legal issues in the case , '' said rick white , associate vice chancellor of communications and public affairs . `` we appreciate the efforts of the mediator to help us achieve a successful and timely conclusion to the mediation . we believe the settlement is in the best interest of the university and allows us to move forward and fully focus on other important issues . '' when she sued , willingham said she hoped to accomplish what no other investigation has done -- to subpoena documents and to depose university officials under oath . her lawsuit never got that far . instead , she says she 's hoping that will be accomplished by a larger class-action lawsuit filed by powerhouse attorney michael hausfeld on behalf of two former unc athletes . devon ramsay and rashanda mccants both sued in january , saying they were promised an education but did n't get one because of the paper class scandal . hausfeld is the attorney who beat the ncaa last summer in federal court on behalf of former ucla player ed o'bannon , winning a case that will forever change college sports by forcing the ncaa to eliminate the rule that forbids schools from paying players . that lawsuit is the reason willingham says she was ok with entering into mediation in her whistleblower suit . she shared the settlement document with cnn . `` it 's about the students and not about me . i do n't need it to be about me , '' willingham said . `` i got an education , but those students left without one , and we still have a system that does n't work . and so i 'm hopeful that -lrb- the hausfeld lawsuit -rrb- will move forward and prove that -lrb- ncaa division i -rrb- schools all across the country have a flawed system where a promise of an education is n't happening , and therefore these students are getting nothing .

beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- when it came to the environment in china , it was hazy through much of the weekend -- literally and figuratively . as a thick layer of toxic air blanketed beijing and much of northern china on friday , censors smothered a wildly popular but controversial documentary on the country 's air pollution , removing it from all major video streaming sites . at a standing-room-only press conference saturday , the newly appointed minister of environmental protection ignored raised hands of foreign journalists eager to ask about the development and made no mention of the documentary that he had praised just a week earlier . without a hint of irony , he promised to be more transparent and reassured the masses of their right to oversee the government 's fight against air pollution . `` under the dome '' -- a slickly produced two-hour documentary on journalist chai jing 's dogged quest to find the causes and solutions to china 's severe smog problem -- attracted over 200 million views online in just one week , an unprecedented number even in the world 's most populous nation . supporters and detractors of chai , a famous former anchor and reporter at state-run national broadcaster cctv , began a war of words almost immediately after the video 's release on february 28 . admirers compared it to `` an inconvenient truth , '' the oscar-winning documentary on former u.s. vice president al gore 's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming . critics , on the other hand , portrayed it as a piece of shoddy investigative journalism filled with bad science and biased conclusions , which blamed the problem largely on the entrenched interests of the state oil industry . some even called it propaganda for president xi jinping , who had declared keeping the sky blue a top policy priority . the new environment minister 's initial response to the video -- in the form of a widely reported text message of gratitude to chai -- reinforced some doubts over chai 's claim of editorial independence for her self-funded project . many more people , however , perceived it as an encouraging sign of the government 's adoption of a more open attitude to a politically sensitive topic , as xi and other leaders started to publicly acknowledge the severity and urgency of the issue . but such optimism was dashed 24 hours after the documentary 's launch , as censors moved to reign in increasingly heated online debates surrounding air pollution and beyond , and removed all mention of the video from homepages of major websites . as the week progressed , leaked state media memos -- widely circulated on social media -- revealed ever-harsher wording from propaganda authorities as they scrambled to limit the continuing impact of the video . finally , after millions of clicks , `` under the dome '' vanished from much of chinese cyberspace friday as heavy smog descended on the capital . also in beijing were almost 3,000 delegates who had gathered to attend the national people 's congress , china 's rubber-stamp parliament that meets in full once a year to approve the ruling communist party 's legislative proposals . pollution has remained a hot topic at this year 's session , state-run xinhua news agency reported , adding that xi vowed to legislators friday `` to give an iron hand to any polluters in the smog-choked country . '' with chai 's viral video also encountering an iron hand , analysts explained that the seeming contradiction makes perfect sense in a one-party dictatorship with little tolerance for open dissent . `` smog is like any other problem in china -- dig it too deep and you touch the issue of political system , '' said yao bo , a well-known news commentator with more than 1.2 million followers on chinese social media . `` the video does n't do that but comments on it had started to question the system . '' `` i think the video caught censors off guard , '' he added , dismissing the idea that its fate reflected infighting among china 's senior leaders . `` the censors eventually acted as expected , after going through this bureaucratic process that is always half a step behind . '' as gusty winds blew away beijing 's smog sunday afternoon , this much became clear to the public : in china , the government cares about the environment as much as you do , but only one of you is free to talk about it .
beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- china 's premier on sunday offered a sobering assessment of the world 's second largest economy amid fears of a sustained slowdown but brushed aside concern that it could face a full-blown economic crisis . `` i do n't deny that the chinese economy is facing downward pressure and multiple risks , '' said li keqiang at a nationally televised press conference . `` the key is to find the balance between stable growth and structural adjustments under the new normal -lrb- of slower growth -rrb- . '' `` we have n't adopted the policy of strong short-term stimulus in recent years -- in other words ... we still have plenty of tools in our toolbox , '' he offered . earlier this month , the people 's bank of china -- the central bank -- cut interest rates to guard against deflation and the country set its lowest growth target in 25 years . li , the no. 2 leader in china behind president xi jinping , also promised a further streamlined government to strengthen the role of free market in the economy . `` the pain of reform is still there , actually the pain is becoming more acute and in more places , '' he said . `` during the course of reform , vested interested will be tested -- but this is not nail clipping , this is like cutting off one 's limb with a sword and we have to do it despite the pain . '' li held the highly choreographed annual press conference -- often the only occasion a senior chinese leader faces the media -- after china 's rubber-stamp parliament approved the government budget and concluded this year 's 10-day session . li answered questions from pre-selected journalists that focused on the economy and touched on the government 's stance on the anti-corruption campaign , the environment and foreign policy . before he was ushered out of the ornate room , the premier responded to a question shouted from the audience about myanmar , whose warplanes reportedly dropped a bomb friday in a chinese border town and killed four civilians . `` we have the responsibility and capability to firmly safeguard the stability of the chinese-myanmar border -- and will firmly protect the lives and property of our citizens , '' li said to applause from chinese reporters .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- two days after odin lloyd was found dead , new england patriots star aaron hernandez looked into the eyes of team owner robert kraft and said he was innocent , kraft testified tuesday in hernandez 's murder trial . kraft , answering questions from a prosecutor and one of hernandez 's attorneys on the witness stand in a massachusetts courtroom , recalled a private conversation that he had with the star patriots tight end on june 19 , at the patriots ' gillette stadium , as news spread that hernandez was being investigated in lloyd 's death . `` he said he was not involved , '' kraft testified in the courtroom in fall river . `` he said he was innocent . '' hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of lloyd , a semipro football player who was found dead in massachusetts on june 17 , 2013 . hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge . his co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . kraft testified that he asked to speak with hernandez in an office near a weight room in the stadium , and asked the player to look him in the eye and tell him if he was involved in lloyd 's death . according to kraft , hernandez told him during that meeting that he hoped the time of lloyd 's death `` came out , '' because hernandez had been at a club that night . according to testimony from hernandez 's fiancée , shayanna jenkins , the player had not been at a club , but was at dinner with her and some friends before the shooting . mel robbins , a cnn legal analyst , called kraft 's testimony `` explosive . '' `` what a great , great witness for the prosecution , '' she said . `` basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss . and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand . '' how did hernandez know when the murder happened , robbins asked , unless he was there ? the patriots ' owner also testified , when asked by a defense attorney , that he 'd never had any problems with hernandez , and that the player was always respectful to him . the billionaire magnate of the kraft group , a company with interests ranging from paper and packaging concerns to sports and entertainment , said hernandez always greeted him with a hug and kiss . asked by the defense why hernandez was signed to a $ 40 million long-term contract , kraft said simply : `` he 's a very good player . '' at times during his 30 minutes or so on the witness stand , kraft seemed uncomfortable . `` do you work ? '' bristol county district attorney william mccauley asked kraft . `` i think so , yes . '' asked where he worked , kraft responded , 1 patriot place , or gillette stadium , where the super bowl champions play their home games . `` what do you do for work ? '' `` whatever they ask me to do . '' outside court , surrounded by cameras , kraft expressed sadness over lloyd 's death . `` a man died , '' he said . `` this is about a man being killed . it 's unfortunate . '' later , mark briggs , head of security at gillette stadium , testified that he also asked hernandez whether the former star was telling the truth about lloyd . `` he swore on the baby 's life that he was telling the truth , '' briggs said . hernandez was arrested in connection with lloyd 's death a week after that meeting with kraft . the patriots released hernandez less than two hours after the arrest on june 26 , 2013 . jenkins , 25 , and hernandez are the parents of a young daughter . jenkins ' sister shaneah was dating lloyd , 27 , who was shot six times , according to prosecutors . the trial began in late january .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- andreas lubitz , the co-pilot who authorities say deliberately crashed germanwings flight 9525 in france , passed all his tests and medical exams and gave no voluntary indication that he was unstable or mentally ill , lufthansa ceo carsten spohr told cnn thursday . `` we have at lufthansa a reporting system where crew can report without being punished their own problems or they can report about problems of others without any kind of punishment . that has n't been used either in this case , so all these safety nets we are so proud of here have not worked in this case , '' spohr said . lubitz had been with germanwings since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time after training at the airline 's flight center in bremen , germany , the company has said . germanwings is the budget carrier for lufthansa . the ceo said he did n't know much more than what has been released by french authorities : the captain left the cockpit , tried to regain access by knocking on the door and `` the door was either kept locked or not opened in the way it was supposed to be , and that for sure is a clear indication that the remaining pilot -- the co-pilot -- did n't want the captain to return . '' had the copilot suffered a medical emergency -- as some experts speculated in the initial hours after the accident -- there are safety procedures in place so that the pilot can re-access the cockpit , he said . that is , `` unless the person on the inside locks it and this apparently has happened here , '' the ceo said . after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , cockpit doors were manufactured to withstand manual force and small weapons , so there was `` no way to get back to the cockpit for the captain , '' he said . spohr was asked why lubitz was allowed to be alone in the cockpit . american airlines require that any pilot leaving the flight deck be replaced by a flight attendant , so that two people remain in the cockpit at all times , but that 's not the case with all airlines internationally , cnn aviation analyst david soucie said . an 8-minute descent to death . a lufthansa spokesman previously said that the airline complies with all german and european aviation regulations , something spohr reiterated in his cnn interview . `` most airlines around the world follow the same procedures as lufthansa that in flight phases with low workload , the pilot can leave the cockpit -- especially for physical need -- and then he returns to the cockpit as fast as he can . that 's a global thing , most accepted procedure , which we have used at lufthansa for many , many years , '' spohr said . asked if the airline might reconsider this policy in light of tuesday 's crash , spohr said it was possible . `` i think we look at that as well , but we should not put the whole system at stake just because of this terrible single accident , '' he said . the airline will be consulting with its own experts , aviation authorities and experts with other airlines to determine what , if any , of its procedures need to be bolstered to prevent future such accidents from occurring , spohr said , adding that he stood strongly by the manner in which lufthansa operates airplanes and trains its employees . `` we understand emotions after this terrible accident , but for us as professionals we need to ensure the safety focus of lufthansa is in no way touched -- and i promise you it 's not -- and we will do our very , very best to even improve it further .

barrington , new hampshire -lrb- cnn -rrb- u.s. sen. ted cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a new hampshire speech on sunday , hitting the current administration on the economy , obamacare and national security . `` and the obama-clinton foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire , '' the senator from texas declared . but he was stopped by a 3-year-old girl sitting in the front row . `` the world is on fire ? '' she yelled out . cruz took it and ran with it . `` the world is on fire -- yes ! your world is on fire , '' he exclaimed , seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter . `` but you know what ? your mommy 's here and everyone 's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better . '' the scene -- while cute -- captured cruz 's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language , never backtracking . there was no `` just kidding '' or `` that was only a metaphor '' to assuage the little girl . instead , the first-term senator continued with his speechifying and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now , they could get better -- especially , cough cough , if he becomes president . a woman who identified herself as the child 's mother named michelle later told the wrko 's kuhner report that her child 's reaction came in a `` high question kind of voice , '' but that her daughter was `` quite happy '' in the aftermath . `` she really , basically was like ` oh , oh , this is a great man . ' he 's the firefighter in her mind as a three-year-old . and was quite happy and she wanted a cookie . '' cruz is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he 's built in congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a white house bid . this weekend , he was on a two-day swing through new hampshire , stopping sunday afternoon at an event put on by the strafford county gop . in the same way cruz challenges establishment republicans in the senate , he 's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism . for example , his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality , a huge issue in the first-in-the-nation primary state . but cruz argued that not only is money a form of speech , it emboldens speech . `` the answer is not to muzzle citizens ; it 's to empower citizens across the country , '' he said . throwing a bone to his questioner , however , he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed . he took the same steadfast approach last weekend in iowa , when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol -- a popular regulation in iowa where corn is king . while nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate , cruz flatly opposed it , saying in front of close to a thousand iowa farmers that he does n't think the government should be involved in the private sector . gov. scott walker , who 's vying with jeb bush for frontrunner status , said he supported the mandate in iowa , despite previously opposing it in his home state of wisconsin . asked by reporters sunday about accusations that walker is a flip-flopper , cruz first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions . `` it 's easy for candidates to give an answer , '' he said , but added : `` the proof is in the pudding . what i 've urged republicans to ask of every candidate is : have you walked the walk ? show me your record . '' cruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to `` repeal every word of common core , '' a set of testing standards that jeb bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in dover , new hampshire just two days earlier . common core , however , was not legislation approved by congress . rather , it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders , and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards . still , cruz played somewhat coy with his white house aspirations , aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they 're running for president . when voters pressed him sunday to make a white house bid , cruz told them to `` stay tuned . '' `` i 'm looking at it very , very seriously , '' he told the audience . `` i would point out a week ago i was in iowa , yesterday i was in south carolina , and today i 'm in new hampshire . '' but he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently , one of the girls gave her approval for cruz 's presidential aspirations . `` if you win , that means snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in , '' his daughter said , according to cruz . in terms of energy and turnout , sunday 's event stood out from other events held by potential white house contenders who were in new hampshire this weekend , in part because it was open to the public , unlike other events headlined by walker and bush . his remarks were met with boisterous applause , and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event . halfway through cruz 's remarks , a small-business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two-minute rant about how other republicans in washington are n't representing their conservative constituents . `` it is d-day in america folks , '' he said , getting the crowd on their feet . `` we ca n't wait for another republican . we need ted cruz . '' the man said his wife wrote a blank check for cruz and pulled out his wallet , only to throw it on the ground at cruz 's feet . `` for those who believe in miracles , this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician , '' cruz said , getting a big laugh from the crowd . `` and he actually got it back . '' cruz could not accept the money because he 's not yet a candidate . one man , bill higgins , stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping cruz would meet his goat named izak , an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said `` i voted '' and who happened to bite jon huntsman in 2011 . cruz waved hello at higgins as the senator exited the building sunday afternoon but did n't stop to greet the goat . `` he 'll be back again , '' higgins said , trying to appear unfazed . `` i 'm sure he wants to get to his next stop . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- when it comes to the u.s. fraternity and sorority system , it 's a disturbing truth : life is largely segregated by race , money and power ; and , yet , most of us find that unsurprising . this week , however , we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change . the push came in the form of a nine-second youtube video , which i 'm sure you 've seen by now . it reportedly shows members of the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity at the university of oklahoma chanting these chilling lines : `` there will never be a ni **** sae . you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . '' `` the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant , '' cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin writes , describing a clip that rocketed around social media , leading ou 's president , david boren , to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school . the video is hard to watch , but i have a feeling it 's one we need to see , both because it hints at the inner workings of certain greek organizations , and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the united states . i 'm thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public . that alone should give some reason for hope . others were n't , but i was shocked by the video . this , in 2015 ? in my home state ? both of my parents participated in greek life in oklahoma , but at a different university . i know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement . what happened on the bus at ou does n't negate their positive experiences . but it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion . sometimes students are excluded from greek life , in theory , because they 're seen as uncool or do n't `` fit in '' with a particular chapter . but we 'd be kidding ourselves if we did n't realize that , often , a person 's race -- or sexual orientation , for that matter -- factors into this you 're - in , you 're - out process . oklahoma school 's response to video caught between racism , civil rights act . and it 's hard for me not to see the sae video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology . this is a case of dangerous group-think run amok . in a system that remains largely divided by race , perhaps videos like this should n't be so surprising . that 's the view of matthew hughey , an associate professor of sociology at the university of connecticut who studies racial dynamics in american greek life . the u.s. fraternity and sorority system is `` a form of american apartheid , '' he told me in an interview on monday . instead of thinking of the oklahoma fraternity members as `` bad apples , '' he said , we should see them as part of a `` bad orchard . '' that orchard includes , but is n't limited to , greek organizations , he told me . it also includes the rest of us and our country 's racist history . `` largely , these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world , '' he said . sigma alpha epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . comparative data on the racial make-up of these organizations is impossible to come by , but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race . from 2003 to 2006 , hughey spent time interviewing students from greek organizations at three colleges on the east coast . `` at the time of interviews , the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members , and there was an average of 2.4 nonwhite members per organization , '' he wrote in a 2010 paper published by society for the study of social problems . that 's 3.8 % minority members , in those instances . hughey 's sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who 's spent time on a college campus knows to be true : there are white fraternities and there are black ones . sometimes we even dare call them that . far too many of us , especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in greek life , either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism , sexism and violence in the u.s. greek system as somehow isolated . it 's clear that 's not the case . `` in 1992 , texas a&m university fined its chapter $ 1,000 after it threw a ` jungle party ' attended by frat brothers in blackface . then in 2002 , syracuse university suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface . as recently as 2013 , the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed african american students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs , '' according to the washington post 's terrence mccoy . all of that was just sae . other examples are easy to come by , too . according to the new york daily news , here 's the text of an invitation to a 2013 asian-themed kappa sigma party at duke university : `` we look forward to having mi , yu , you and yo friends over for some sake . chank you . '' and in january 2014 , according to the new york times , arizona state university investigated an mlk-day party hosted by the tau kappa epsilon fraternity in which `` nonblack students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys , flashing gang signs and drinking from hollowed-out watermelons . '' it 's clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing . one easy place to start would be simply getting more information . why do n't universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is ? hughey told me that data is n't available . then we could know the answers to some interesting questions : how segregated are greek organizations ? are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others ? what 's the trend over time ? is there progress ? john lewis on oklahoma students : ` they should be gone ' universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations . do traditionally black and latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats ? if not , why ? and why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place ? what does that do to the student body as a whole ? i 'm not calling for an end to the greek system . but it 's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes . `` any time there are racist remarks made , we must speak up as americans , '' boren , the ou president , said in a news conference . he added that he hopes the sae students `` think long and hard '' about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week . `` i hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people , '' he said . the rest of us should do that , too .

paris -lrb- cnn -rrb- french lawmakers are weighing a ban on extremely thin models . new legislation debated in parliament tuesday would require modeling agencies to get medical certificates from models proving that their body mass index is at least 18 . models would also be required to undergo regular weight checks . and agencies that violate the law could face fines and even possible prison sentences . dr. olivier veran , a doctor and french lawmaker who 's proposing the measures , said it 's time to put a stop to the practice of pressuring models to be so thin that it 's dangerous for their health . `` we want to combat the idea that an agency could urge a model to stop eating ; for example eating cotton balls to lose their appetite , to always lose more weight , '' he said . seeing models ' bones as they parade down the catwalk is a troubling trend , veran said . `` we have had chief editors of prestigious magazines tell us that more and more often , they are obliged to use photoshop , not to make the models look slimmer , '' he said , `` but to erase the tracks of bones under the skin , to make them look bigger . '' vernan 's proposed amendments to a health bill would also target the dark online world of pro-anorexia websites that promote self-starvation and encourage young women to post photos of their emaciated frames . the average bmi for a woman in france is 23.2 -- the lowest average in western europe , according to a 2009 study from france 's national institute of demographic studies . in france , veran said , 30,000-40 ,000 people suffer from eating disorders , mainly teenagers . marisol touraine , france 's minister of social affairs , expressed her support for the new anti-anorexia measures in an interview with cnn affiliate bfmtv . `` the approach is good , '' she said , adding that the government will have to examine the wording of the new legislation in further detail . extreme cases such as that of french model isabelle caro have sparked calls for change for years . caro died in 2010 , three years after she posed nude in a controversial ad campaign against anorexia . similar concerns in spain , italy and israel prompted those countries to adopt laws against the use of ultra-thin models on catwalks and in advertising campaigns . israel even has strict rules on how model 's bodies are photoshopped ; any changes must be clearly marked on the photo . some in the industry are supportive of the proposed laws , but say they do n't strike at the real issue . `` the fact of the matter is , fashion creatives have to think about the messaging they are promoting around body image ideals and the fact they are normalizing an unachievable physical appearance , '' said caryn franklin , a fashion commentator . veran 's legislation is set to go before the french parliament at the end of the month for discussion . and he wants to outlaw what he calls starving models by the end of the year . `` i think that by the end of 2015 , '' he said , `` we will no longer have anorexic models on the catwalk .

new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- korean air 's `` nut rage '' case has made its way back to new york , with the flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts filing a lawsuit against the airline and a former executive . heather cho , a korean air executive and daughter of the airline 's chairman , is serving a one-year prison sentence in south korea after throwing a fit on a new york flight because her nuts were served in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl . in a civil suit filed this week in state supreme court in queens , new york , cho -- whose name is listed as heather hyun a-cho in court documents -- is accused of `` verbally and physically '' attacking flight attendant kim do-hee in december on a seoul-bound flight departing from john f. kennedy international airport . at the time , cho , who was seated in first class , demanded that the plane go back to the gate so kim could be kicked off the flight , according to the lawsuit . the episode , which was widely reported , was a `` prime example of the corrupt and entitled behavior of the members of elite south korean business families , '' the lawsuit states . the suit describes cho as the `` princess '' of the `` so-called royal '' family that controls korean air , and says the executive screamed obscenities at kim before hitting , shoving and threatening the flight attendant . on her return to south korea , the lawsuit states , kim was `` pressured to lie to government regulators in order to cover up the incident , and to appear in public with cho as part of an orchestrated effort to try and rehabilitate cho 's public image . '' a south korean judge last month said that cho 's actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers , and ruled that she violated aviation law , changed a flight path and interfered with operations . she was sentenced to a year in jail . the judge blasted cho for her conduct , saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger , she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight . the case is emblematic of growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism of the families that control the country 's top companies . cho resigned as vice president at the company a few days after the incident and publicly apologized , saying she accepted `` full responsibility . '' last month , she appeared in a south korean court wearing a green prison uniform . she gazed downward . her hair hung in her face . `` i do n't know how to find forgiveness , '' she said . park chang-jin , the chief steward who was booted from the flight instead of kim , has said the former executive treated crew members like `` feudal slaves . '' park and kim , the flight attendant who served the nuts , had knelt in front of cho in apology . kim testified that cho berated them about the service and later shoved and cursed her . when the flight arrived in korea , the flight attendant said another airline manager , yeo woon-jin , pressured her not to talk to investigators about cho 's physically abusing her and park . yeo was found guilty of interfering with an investigation . korean air chairman cho yang-ho apologized to the flight attendants and the public following the public uproar over the incident . in a statement , kim 's lawyer , andrew weinstein , called heather cho 's behavior `` humiliating , degrading , and damaging to ms. kim , but ... also emblematic of ms. cho 's unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement . '' the incident has damaged kim 's `` career , reputation , and emotional well-being , '' and efforts to settle the case out of court have been unsuccessful , according to the statement -- which did n't specify how much was being sought in damages . attempts to reach representatives of korean air as well as lawyers for cho were unsuccessful . cnn 's david shortell contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the news that the u.s. military will charge army sgt. bowe bergdahl with desertion for abandoning his post in afghanistan revives a deeply disturbing and morally wrenching incident in america 's troubled war in afghanistan . from the moment last year that the world learned about the prisoner-swap deal that secured his freedom , the questions that surrounded begdahl 's disappearance gained significance . after all , the united states had agreed to a very high price for his release . based on the evidence that has come to public light , desertion seems the right charge against bergdahl , whose comrades say he walked away , abandoning his commitments as a soldier in a war and creating new and greater dangers for them . but even before the charges were filed , there were other question whose answers are emerging . was the united states right to negotiate a high-price trade ? did `` leave no man behind '' trump `` no negotiating with terrorists '' ? and if it did , did the importance of saving one man outweigh the dictate not to pay ransom even if that man was a traitor or a deserter ? new information about his disappearance and life of the people freed in exchange for bergdahl make the case all the more troubling . bergdahl , you will recall , spent five years as a prisoner of the haqqani network , a group allied with the taliban organization , america 's principal enemy in afghanistan . taliban fighters had captured him in june 2009 , just after bergdahl , apparently disenchanted with the military , left his post in southeastern afghanistan . the taliban handed the american soldier to the haqqanis , who shuttled him between locations as they and their partners negotiated for his release , seeking to maximize the profit from their valuable captive . in may 2014 they struck a deal . five taliban commanders were flown out of the u.s. prison at guantanamo bay , freed in exchange for the american soldier whose disappearance many had already labeled a desertion . the images became iconic . a strikingly pale bergdahl , blinking painfully against the bright sun as he was handed over to u.s. officials . the scene contrasted sharply with a video of the taliban chiefs ' receiving a heroes ' welcome in qatar , where they prepared for a new life after their american captivity . national security adviser susan rice said bergdahl had served with `` honor and distinction . '' if that had been the case , the trade would have proved much less controversial . but from the moment bergdahl went missing there had been questions . in the letters he wrote home before vanishing , bergdahl showed a steady erosion of his faith in the military and belief in the mission . `` the future is too good to waste on lies , '' he told his parents . `` and life is way too short to care for the damnation of others . '' men who had served with bergdahl said he had simply walked off the base carrying little more than a compass . not only would such a move constitute near-suicidal foolishness , it also put his comrades in great danger , particularly as they set out on a desperate quest to find him . what has been the cost of bergdahl 's odyssey ? some said the search for him cost the lives of six american soldiers . the specific circumstances are complicated , but it is clear that the six died in paktika province in the months after bergdahl vanished , during a period in which every mission , even if not directly aimed at finding bergdahl , included some element of a search . as one former team leader told cnn , `` when those soldiers were killed , they would not have been where they were if bergdahl had not left . '' one of them , 2nd lt darryn andrews , received a posthumous silver star for saving the lives of five soldiers during a mission that had shifted from searching for a taliban target to looking for bergdahl . andrews left behind a pregnant wife and a 2-year-old son . then there is the cost of signaling to the taliban , of telling all of america 's enemies , that if they capture a u.s. service member they could trade him for a ransom . this could endanger other americans . and there is another potential cost : the men who were freed in exchange for bergdahl could go on to fight again . the more you learn about the details of their post-guantanamo lives , the more distressing the transaction looks . under the terms of the deal , qatar agreed to keep the former prisoners from leaving the country for one year . in the meantime , they are said to be living a life of fantastic comfort and luxury , courtesy of their gracious qatari hosts . according to reports , they have each been allowed to bring five more families to keep them company . the 35 taliban households are living in the lap of qatari luxury , but the fighters are getting restless . at least two of the former guantanamo detainees reportedly want to go back to the battlefield , perhaps adding to the eventual tally of the bergdahl transaction . now bergdahl will face his punishment ; he could be sentenced to life in prison for what the military says was desertion and misbehavior , and what his comrades said was a shameful betrayal -- one that cost lives . the question remains , should the united states have traded for this man ? my sense is that the united states has a duty to the soldiers it sends to war . all soldiers should know that their country will do what it takes to bring them back . america could not leave bergdahl to die in a mountain cave , especially if it did not know with certainty the circumstances of his disappearance -- but even if it did . whether the obama administration negotiated as effectively as it could have is another matter . on that count , i am skeptical . the trade -- bergdahl for several hardened prisoners -- was a heart-splitting dilemma , but it was the right call .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- from the moment we are born , the first question our parents are asked is , `` is it a boy or a girl ? '' the answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child 's path and trajectory for years to come ; however , the question is not simple . the question is tragically flawed and here 's a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question : you 're asking the wrong people . i realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby 's physical `` parts , '' but only that beautiful baby can accurately and authentically tell you what gender he or she is . you may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior 's first baseball glove -- it 's just not that simple . i may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that i know very little about this great big world , but i know way too much about gender and being mislabeled . why transgender teen jazz jennings is everywhere . you see , the doctor told my parents , `` it 's a girl , '' but he could n't have been more wrong . aside from my biology , i knew i was a boy from the age of 2 . i was 100 % sure of who i was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation . keep in mind that this was a time before i had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl 's body was anything beyond normal , and this was long before i could possibly articulate what was happening . however , there was no need to articulate anything . i was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind -- not yet distorted by biology , other people 's confusion , or fear . it was when i was older that other people let me know something was `` off . '' no matter how many times i was told differently , i was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too , for the most part . i want to address the moment where people , gender , and respectful communication part ways . that is the moment when the word `` sexuality '' creeps into the conversation . that is when people get scared , cite religion , start whispering , and disconnect . it 's a sad moment , but i get it . people have always mocked what they do n't understand , and this is a tough one for most to grasp . that said , it has to change and i believe it is changing . the transgender life : what to know , say and understand . i can not stress to the world enough , gender and sexuality are two completely different things , and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight . save your fear people . this is not something to be afraid of ; it 's an opportunity for us to evolve . nothing is completely black or white , hot or cold , here or there , or male and female ; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that , the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are . it all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation . i first heard the term `` gay '' in the second grade , long after i had my first `` girlfriend '' and had proudly written `` a penis '' at the top of my christmas list . not until after i learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did i become afraid of who i was . it was n't until i learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality `` abnormal '' or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that i became terrified that i was `` different . '' i knew i liked girls and i was technically a girl , biologically , but i was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings . i was not gay -- but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over . thankfully , i grew up in a household that taught me that i could love anybody i wanted to and it was fine because it is fine . anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that . fortunately , people have developed more of an understanding of that over time , but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that . do they matter ? of course they do because we all matter , equally ; however , ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate ; everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and i look forward to the battles as much as the victories . as long as you 're happy , you 're indestructible . that said , i knew being gay was n't a bad thing , but i also knew it did n't describe me . i was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that , either . i was afraid of being thought of differently . the most crippling fear came from people not understanding that i was a boy trapped in a girl 's body and simply labeling me something i 'm not . that 's what i was truly afraid of . experience how one family reacted when their daughter said she 's a boy . cnn films presents `` raising ryland , '' a short film available exclusively on cnn digital on wednesday , march 18 . discovering that i was transgender was a miraculous moment . i finally found the key that unlocked the cage i 'd been trapped in for 14 years and that 's why i call this journey , `` my transcension . '' with the support of my parents , i am sharing my story . breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular , but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation . i am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward . i 'm taking the body i was born into and transforming it into the body i know i 'm supposed to be in -- thanks to my family , friends , dr. jo olson , the support groups , the science , and lastly , myself . see , that 's the irony , i was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the `` is it a boy or girl '' question -- not the doctor , my parents , or anyone who thinks they know better . that is the lesson , let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone 's choice . i realize that it 's easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender , i consider that a win for us all . truthfully , i 'm most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it , to proudly begin my transcencion from someone i was n't -- into the man i always knew i 'd become . whether i 'm a boy or a girl , white or black , rich or poor , gay or straight , it 's completely irrelevant . what truly matters is the fact that i 'm avery wallace and i 've always known exactly who i was . i 'm here to share my journey and hopefully , help someone else recognize theirs .
istanbul -lrb- cnn -rrb- a prosecutor involved in a controversial case died tuesday after he was shot during a hostage siege in an istanbul courthouse . prosecutor mehmet selim kiraz died in the hospital from injuries he suffered during the attack , prime minister ahmet davutoglu said , speaking to reporters on turkish television . the two gunmen who took the prosecutor hostage were killed in a shootout with police after a standoff that lasted for hours . kiraz was assigned to the controversial case of berkin elvan , a 15-year-old boy who was injured during the anti-government gezi park protests in june 2013 . the teen died the following march after having spent nine months in a coma . the case , with its overtones of possible police overreaction , has been politically contentious , just as the protests themselves were . in an online post widely cited in turkish media , the left-wing revolutionary people 's liberation party-front claimed responsibility for the attack . the post said the gunmen were seeking to avenge elvan 's death . president recep tayyip erdogan described the gunmen as terrorists and said they were disguised as lawyers when they entered the courthouse . `` this is not to be taken lightly , '' he said . the gunmen took the prosecutor hostage around 12:30 p.m. in his office on the sixth floor of the caglayan district courthouse , the semiofficial anadolu agency reported . police evacuated that floor of the building , the agency reported , and snipers were deployed . an explosion , followed by sounds of more gunshots , could be heard coming from the courthouse tuesday evening , hours after the siege began . istanbul police chief selami altinok said kiraz had been shot before turkish security teams entered the room where the hostage crisis was unfolding . `` there is nothing else to do but to pray at this moment , '' erdogan said . the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front , known as the dhkp-c , is viscerally hostile to the turkish state , the united states and nato , and has had links with the far left in europe . the marxist-leninist group claimed responsibility for a 2013 suicide bombing at the u.s. embassy in ankara . among other attacks attributed to the dhkp-c was the assassination of a former justice minister , mehmet topac , in 1994 , as well as the murders of a number of senior police and military officials and , 1996 , a prominent businessman , ozdemir sabanci . cnn 's gul tuysuz reported from istanbul . cnn 's don melvin reported from london . cnn 's nimet kirac reported from atlanta . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , paul cruickshank and tim lister contributed to this report .
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- russian president vladimir putin awarded medals monday to chechen leader ramzan kadyrov and to andrei lugovoi , the suspect in the murder of former russian security agent alexander litvinenko , among more than 30 other honorees . kadyrov was given the order of merit . the decree signed by putin states : `` for work achievements , active social activities and many years of diligent work the order of merit is awarded to ramzan kadyrov , the president of the chechen republic . '' lugovoi , the suspect in the poisoning death of former russian security agent alexander litvinenko , was given a second-class medal of the order of merit for the motherland , according to putin 's decree . sergey kislyak , a diplomat who 's been serving as russia 's ambassador to the united states since 2008 , was also among the honorees . he was cited as an `` honored employee of a diplomatic service . '' lugovoi is an mp in russia 's lower house of parliament for the nationalist and pro-kremlin liberal democratic party . he is deputy chairman of the lower house 's security and anti-corruption committee . he also has hosted a show called `` traitors '' on russian tv and runs a restaurant in moscow . kadyrov has spoken out about the assassination of opposition leader boris nemtsov , defending zaur dadayev , one of the chechens charged in the shooting . `` zaur dadayev was a russian interior ministry officer who served with distinction , '' kadyrov said on his instagram account . putin 's spokesman dmitry peskov said it was a coincidence that the arrest of suspects in nemtsov 's killing happened around the same time as the award to the chechen president . in an interview with russian business outlet rbc , he stressed that the decree on awards was filed several months ago .
havana , cuba -lrb- cnn -rrb- so what has u.s. state department subcontractor alan gross been up to since he was released from a cuban prison exactly three months ago ? it turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us . gross , 65 , has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in cuba by traveling abroad , attending the state of the union address as a guest of the obamas and last week meeting pope francis at the vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win gross ' freedom . after five years of being disconnected from the outside world , gross now frequently posts on social media , writing of family reunions , eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in cuba . `` i ca n't get away from cuba , '' gross wrote after hearing a cuban song playing in an airport on his travels . while visiting israel , he posted a photo of cohiba cigars advertised for sale in a tel aviv tobacco shop . in 2009 , gross was arrested by cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island . gross said he was merely helping the island 's small jewish community get online , but cuban officials accused of him being part of a u.s. government plot to destabilize the island 's single-party communist government . cuba has highly restricted internet access , and most people are not able to access the web in their homes or on their phones . on december 17 , 2014 , gross was freed , along with three cuban intelligence agents and a cuban man convicted of spying for the united states . it was part of a deal between the cuban and u.s. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of cold war animosity . gross , his wife , judy , his attorney and three u.s. congressmen flew from havana to his home state of maryland aboard a u.s. military jet , one of the smaller versions of air force one used to transport president barack obama . the image of gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with cnn reporting the news of his release on a tv screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @alanpgross twitter page . the night of his release , he enjoyed a meal of spicy thai food with family and friends , a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison . in january , gross changed the status of his facebook page to read that he had left his job as `` hostage '' at the carlos finlay military hospital where had been held in havana . later , he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist 's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in cuba . with his dental concerns met , he moved on to food . gross also recounted savoring long-denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese . many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence : gross renewing an expired driver 's license or visiting a starbucks for the first time in five years . but in other posts , he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in israel , seeing the snow fall in washington and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the internet . a spokeswoman for gross turned down a cnn request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his . rep. chris van hollen , the democrat representing the maryland district gross hails from , called it `` incredibly moving '' that a man who spent five years in a cuban prison has since sat next to first lady michelle obama and met the pope . more than that , he 's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in washington and havana . `` alan did not ask for this special role in history , '' van hollen said , `` but he 's become a catalyst for this new chapter in american and cuban relations . '' the photos that gross posted online show a smiling man , slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison , no longer the gaunt-faced , hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in cuba . `` the distance we 've come since december 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey , '' gross wrote in a facebook post saturday . `` for which we 're grateful . ''
leicester , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- richard iii , the king found beneath a car parking lot , has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service , 530 years after his death in battle . the remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of leicester in august 2012 . they have been pored over by scientists at the city 's university ever since , but after more than two years of legal wranglings , the bones were finally laid to rest thursday in a coffin built by richard iii 's distant relative , michael ibsen , whose dna helped prove their identity . it was standing room-only at leicester cathedral -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as archbishop of canterbury justin welby led prayers for the long-dead king , swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket , before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth , life and death . oscar-nominated actor benedict cumberbatch , a distant cousin of england 's last plantagenet king , read a poem dedicated to richard iii , written by poet laureate carol ann duffy . `` my bones , scripted in light , upon cold soil , a human braille . my skull , scarred by a crown , emptied of history . describe my soul as incense , votive , vanishing ; your ownthe same . grant me the carving of my name . '' queen elizabeth , represented at the ceremony by the countess of wessex , sent a special message to mark the reinterment , which she hailed as `` an event of great national and international significance . '' `` today we recognize a king who lived through turbulent times and whose christan faith sustained him in life and death , '' it read . but though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin , empty tomb , relatives clad in gloomy , pitch-dark suits -- this was not , the organizers insisted , a sad occasion . `` this is not a funeral at which we mourn , '' said professor gordon campbell , of the university of leicester , welcoming the congregation to the cathedral , just yards from that famous parking lot . instead , the aim of the service was to offer richard iii a fitting farewell , and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at bosworth in 1485 . back then , his body was slung over a horse and carried back to leicester -- legend has it that his head struck bow bridge on the way -- before being put on display for three days , to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead , before being slung into a hastily-dug grave at the church of the grey friars . now richard 's bones , accompanied by a specially-crafted rosary , recognizing his catholic faith , rest in a lead-lined coffin of english oak , his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale swaledale fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black kilkenny marble carved with his name , dates , coat of arms , and his symbol : a white boar . speaking before the commemorations , philippa langley , founder of the `` looking for richard '' project , said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment : `` richard died over 500 years ago , so i do n't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all . i hope there 's perhaps some joy , that something has been done well and right and that we 've made peace with the past . '' but ibsen admitted he found sunday 's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving : `` there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs , which caught me completely unawares , '' he said phlegmatically . `` leicester born and bred '' sisters susan foster and sharon stirling were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving . `` this is history , is n't it , it 's never going to happen again , '' said foster . `` we grew up with all the stories of richard iii . we lived close to bow bridge , so we know all the legends about him . '' stirling said she thought the richard iii story would be a big bonus for the city : `` i think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he 's got quite a fan club , after all . '' leicester has always been proud of its links to richard iii ; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor , there 's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave . but in recent days , interest has risen to fever pitch : shop windows are full of richard-themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery . the florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses , which people have been leaving at richard iii 's statue , and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs , from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate . there 's even a `` return of the king '' beer -- locally brewed and promising `` a distinctive regal flavor . '' some 35,000 people lined the bunting-and-flag-draped streets of leicester and its surrounding villages on sunday to watch as the king 's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again . another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay `` in repose '' at the cathedral in the days since , watched over by an honor guard of veterans . among them was jane gregory , who traveled two hours by bus from her home in south derbyshire twice in a week to be there . `` it was just something i had to see and experience -- it 's part of history , '' she told cnn outside the reburial service on thursday . `` i came on monday too , to view the coffin -- it was a great experience . i queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute . '' history enthusiast paul eames stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his ipad after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife karen : `` i applied for tickets for both of us ; i could have cried when i saw the envelope with her name on it . '' `` i did n't originally want to go , '' karen admitted , smiling . `` but he told me ` you 'll be part of history , you do n't realize ! ' the service was amazing , really lovely . '' not everyone was there just to celebrate richard iii , though . leicester student sherry xie said she was `` proud '' of her university 's role in the discovery of his bones , but she and her classmate wendy jiang admitted they 'd come along with an ulterior motive : `` to see benedict ! '' in his sermon , the bishop of leicester , tim stevens said those who had joined the commemorations '' -lrb- came -rrb- not to judge , condemn or praise , but to stand in silent , humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity . '' stevens said the search for richard iii had `` broken open not just a car park , but a nation 's story . '' it also provoked bitter quarrels between rival factions over where and how he should be buried , and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to . but campbell insisted that the service was held in a `` spirit of reconciliation , '' a thought echoed by stevens : `` whether we bear a white or a red rose , whether for richard or henry ... whether for leicester or york , we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place , where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust . '' langley , the driving force behind the search for the king , said thursday 's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long-running saga ; but she said work to re-examine richard 's life and legacy would go on . `` it 's the conclusion to his story in that he 's been found ... and we 're laying his physical remains to rest . but in terms of richard 's story , that is only just beginning .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- on any other wednesday morning , the steps in front of the joseph-koenig-gymnasium would be packed with kids on their way to class , discussing homework , chattering about last night 's tv shows , or laying out plans for the coming weekend . but not today . instead , students approached in silence , carrying photographs and flowers . in small groups , the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly , or dissolving into tears . at 10:53 a.m. tuesday morning , this school in the small western german town of haltern was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km -lrb- about 620 miles -rrb- away . a germanwings plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to spain crashed in the french alps , killing all of those on board . headmaster ulrich wessel said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful , thinking `` perhaps they had missed the plane , or perhaps there was a second germanwings flight at the same time . '' instead , the worst was confirmed , leaving him `` stunned and somewhat speechless , '' the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss . `` a week ago tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip , '' wessel told reporters . `` what was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy . '' of the 16 teenagers killed , 14 were girls , and two boys ; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed . in a post on the school 's website , wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead , `` who will never again return to us , '' leaving all those concerned `` unutterably sad . '' the teenagers who died were : linda bergjurgen , elena bless , lea druppel , selina eils , gina michelle gerdes , ann-christin hahn , julia hermann , marleen koch , paula lutkenhaus , fabio rogge , rabea scheideler , lea schukart , helena siebe , steffen strang , aline venhoff and caja westermann . the two teachers were identified as sonja cercek and stefanie tegethoff . as news of the crash spread , the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial , filled with red and white candles , notes and swiftly-painted signs . `` yesterday we were many , today we are alone , '' reads one . `` why ? '' demands another , with painful simplicity . philippa , a friend of many of those who died , told cnn she was shocked by what had happened : `` i knew all of them , they were in my grade . to some i was very close . `` we had already planned things for the future , what we were going to do when they returned from their trip . it is very hard to believed that we can not do that . '' grief counselors , chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster . `` i 've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve , '' said wessel . `` i hope we will all get through it , if we share it . '' as the world 's media descend on the town , messages of support have come flooding in too . the local newspaper is running an online book of condolence , in which people can leave messages of sympathy and `` light '' virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school . `` a silent hug says more than many words , '' wrote manuela donovang . `` wishing the families , friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead . '' in his message , udo hentschel said the suffering of the parents , friends and families was `` incomprehensible , unfathomable '' and offered them his condolences : `` this , the worst of all fates , will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together . '' in an attempt to show that solidarity , schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on friday at 10:53 a.m. , the time the plane crashed . for the classmates of those who will never return , that silence will go on , as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come . `` our school is no longer what it once was , '' said wessel . `` in haltern we had 1,283 students . it is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- what does 17-time grand slam winner roger federer have to talk about with world no. 4 andy murray ? hairstyles , apparently . federer crashed the scot 's q&a twitter session on thursday to tease murray about his lustrous locks , asking `` how do you get your hair to be so curly ?

-lrb- cnn -rrb- two million illnesses . 23,000 deaths . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , that 's the human toll from antibiotic-resistant `` superbugs '' each year in the united states . to fight the growing problem of infections that ca n't be treated , the administration of president barack obama is implementing a five-year national action plan at a cost of $ 1.2 billion . those funds , part of the president 's 2015 budget , which must still be approved by congress , would nearly double the amount of federal money allocated to the fight . the plan calls for creating a `` one-health '' approach to testing and reporting superbugs around the country , as well as establishing a dna database of resistant bacteria . new , rapid tests to detect emerging resistant bacteria will be developed . research for new antibiotics and vaccines will accelerate . the plan calls for two new options for people , and three for animals , by 2020 . global surveillance and cooperation is also stressed , including a global database for animals . a key goal is to slow the growth and spread of superbugs by reducing the use of antibiotics when they are n't needed . the plan calls for a 50 % reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in doctor 's offices and a 20 % reduction in hospital use by 2020 . `` this is a lofty goal , '' said internist and emory associate professor dr. sandra fryhofer . `` it 's important for both patients and professionals to be on board . '' there are still details to work out . `` who determines what 's appropriate ? '' asked atlanta pediatrician dr. jennifer shu . `` are we going to have a checklist of requirements that have to be met ? i think it might be a bit tough to measure , but i think improvement can definitely happen . '' a recent survey of 796 health care professionals found 63 % of the sample prescribed antibiotics when they were n't absolutely necessary , at least 10 % of the time . a top reason : the patient requested it . `` some patients put a lot of pressure on doctors to give them an antibiotic , and they may think they 're not getting good care if they 're not given one . but that 's just not true , '' said fryhofer . `` it 's become like an insurance policy but it 's an insurance policy that does n't give good dividends . '' `` i do find there is a lot of education that has to go on with patients that might expect antibiotics when their child is sick , '' said shu , `` but i think in recent years i have seen more of an awareness , and many of my patients are more hesitant to ask . '' another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food . it will also phase in oversight by veterinarians for other uses of antibiotics in feed and water . while applauding the spirit of the pledge , critics say the limits are still too voluntary and limited in scope . `` the problem we have with the plan is that it only removes the growth claims from the label , '' said senior analyst steve roach at keep antibiotics working . `` what we hoped for in the plan was a commitment from fda to identify which antibiotic uses other than growth promotion need to be changed . '' `` with 80 % of the antibiotics produced in the united states being used in agriculture mostly for prevention , '' said louise slaughter , d-new york , who has an alternate proposal in front of congress , `` any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm . trusting a voluntary policy that lets industry police itself will not bring about real change .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- as the u.s. and several eastern european nato countries conduct a series of military exercises near russia 's border , russian president vladimir putin has ordered his northern fleet `` to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise '' in the arctic , state-run media reported monday . at least one russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the `` international situation . '' the fleet got its orders at 8 a.m. monday , according to sputnik , launching a land , sea and air drill that will involve 38,000 troops , 41 ships , 15 submarines and 110 aircraft . `` the main task of the -lrb- combat readiness drill -rrb- is to assess the armed forces from the northern fleet 's capabilities in fulfilling tasks in providing military security of the russian federation in the arctic region , '' russian defense minister gen. sergey shoigu told the media outlet . `` new challenges and threats of military security demand the further heightening of military capabilities of the armed forces and special attention will be paid to the state of the newly formed strategic merging -lrb- of forces -rrb- in the north . '' the drills will run through friday , sputnik reported . a flotilla of minesweepers will support the northern fleet 's nuclear submarines in the barents sea as part of the drill , the tass news agency reported , citing a defense ministry statement . `` mine-sweeping groups of the kola flotilla have moved to the designated areas of the barents within the framework of a snap check of combat readiness of the northern fleet forces for supporting the deployment of the main forces of the fleet , including the deployment of nuclear and diesel submarines of the northern fleet , '' the statement says . the ships will conduct magnetic , acoustic and contact demining sweeps during the drill , tass reported . despite a number of countries participating in various military drills in eastern europe , a kremlin spokesman described the northern fleet inspection as routine practice aimed at improving military capabilities . `` the practice of snap checks will become regular , as it is beneficial for improving the mechanisms of control and operation of the armed forces . this is an absolutely regular process of the armed forces ' operation , of preparation and development of russia 's armed forces , '' dmitry peskov told tass on monday . conversely , a diplomat told tass that russia was `` deeply concerned '' about nato drills near its border . `` it is especially surprising that this is happening in northeastern europe , which is the most stable region not only on our continent , but also maybe in the whole world , '' russian deputy foreign minister alexey meshkov said . `` such nato actions lead to destabilization of the situation and increasing tensions in northeastern europe . '' among the recent drills in eastern europe : . • in its largest military operation in decades , norway sent 5,000 troops to conduct military exercises between alta and lakselv in finnmark county , which borders russia , according to the barents observer . • about 100 u.s. soldiers are expected to conduct an exercise this month using a patriot missile battery and a polish air defense brigade `` at a location on polish territory , '' pentagon spokesman col. steve warren said . the exercise is part of operation atlantic resolve , which began in response to russia 's involvement in ukraine and its annexation of crimea last year , the u.s. defense department said . • also as part of operation atlantic resolve , the u.s. army will soon send armored stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six european countries to show solidarity with its allies . the `` highly visible '' convoy will travel through estonia , lithuania , poland , latvia and the czech republic en route to vilseck , germany , a u.s. army europe spokesman told the military newspaper , stars and stripes . • in a `` regularly scheduled '' exercise aimed at demonstrating nato 's commitment to `` collective defense '' in the black sea , the standing nato maritime group two -- a collection of warships -- will train with the bulgarian , romanian and turkish navies and visit varna , bulgaria , to meet with local authorities and navy officials , nato said . • the u.s. air force moved a dozen a-10 thunderbolt `` tankbuster '' attack jets to an air base in germany and the u.s. military placed hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in latvia , where they 'll be matched up with 3,000 troops from fort stewart , georgia . cnn 's brad lendon contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` good night malaysian three-seven-zero . '' it was a routine sign-off , an all-is-well . on march 8 , 2014 , at 1:19 a.m. , someone spoke those last words from malaysia airlines flight 370 to air traffic controllers before the boeing 777 vanished . a year later , searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board . radar and satellite reports have provided hints , but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands . no wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore . no fuselage resting on the sea floor . experts have said the data indicate the flight path from kuala lumpur , malaysia , to beijing unexpectedly veered , putting the commercial jet over the southern indian ocean . but the water 's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets . and as clarity has eluded grasp , analysts have made many speculations about what happened . the most controversial idea : is the maritime search area all wrong ? did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground ? here are some expert theories about what happened to mh370 . investigators have since cast doubt on some of their details . who radioed those last words to air traffic control ? capt. zaharie ahmad shah ? first officer fariq abdul hamid ? there was much speculation over that , but the malaysian inspectors in april said it was zaharie . the pilots were supposed to check in with new air traffic controllers in vietnam , but never did . one theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other , then guided the plane to its end , taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide . mark weiss , a retired american airlines captain , has flown a boeing 777 . he believed shortly after the crash that there may have been a struggle . `` it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane , '' he said . but malaysia airlines chief executive ahmad jauhari yahya has vehemently defended his employees , particularly the pilot . `` we do not suspect any one of our crew until there 's such evidence . ... captain zaharie is a very capable man , '' he said . `` we have no reason to suspect -lrb- him -rrb- . '' weiss also thought there could have been another person -- a crew member or someone else -- in the cockpit who `` was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft . '' copilot hamid , 27 , reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between thailand and malaysia . `` that 's an enormous breach of security , '' weiss said . but investigators punched holes in the idea , saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit , cnn reported in april . the difference between hijacking and commandeering is nuanced . the former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a safe-haven country or receiving ransom to release passengers . when people commandeer a plane , they might keep the motives secret , said political analyst peter bergen . they may want to steer it themselves at a target , like the september 11 , 2001 , terrorists did . in 1994 , a fedex employee burst into the cockpit of fedex flight 705 with a hammer and spear gun . he wanted to crash the plane into the company 's memphis , tennessee , headquarters . the crew thwarted that takeover . `` commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know , and -lrb- it 's -rrb- certainly a theory that we have n't heard a lot of that is n't a conspiracy , '' bergen said . experts are divided on this theory , partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world 's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something . mh370 went to kazakhstan . outlandish conjecture or genius insight ? the theory that russian actors on board mh370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of china , pakistan and india to a kazakh landing strip leased to russia comes from science journalist and private pilot jeff wise . fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction , he says . the airliner went north , not south . investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the inmarsat satellite data . `` this is not a normal investigation . they need to throw out the book , '' wise has said . another aviation analyst , david soucie , also cast doubt after mh370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the indian ocean . `` if it had crashed in the way that we think it did , which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces , there would be pieces somewhere , '' he said . but michael exner , an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry , says the data `` accurately and unambiguously '' shows mh370 went down near the so-called 7th arc , a path along which the search has been focused . `` the current atsb search strategy remains the best search strategy , '' he said . in a less sinister but equally lethal explanation , some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction . perhaps the electronics died , or a fire broke out , preventing the pilots from communicating . maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but could n't steer the plane properly . pilots had trouble embracing the thought . `` i 've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened , '' said jim tilmon , an aviation expert and retired american airlines pilot . `` one possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very , very hard to imagine because -lrb- the plane -rrb- has so many generators coming from different places , '' tilmon said . if they fail , there are other backups . he has said he 's never heard of anything like it happening before . for months after mh370 disappeared , malaysian officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public . something would be spotted , hopes rose , and then it did n't pan out . hopes were dashed ; anguish returned . sunday , a year to the day after the plane disappeared , the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of mh370 . it found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft 's pilots and cabin crew before it took off , and said that zaharie had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him . the interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane 's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance . the battery on the plane 's other so-called black box , the cockpit voice recorder , had been replaced as scheduled , and remained within its expiry date , the report said . cnn 's pamela boykoff and jethro mullen contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the prospect of a palestinian state is nil so long as prime minister benjamin netanyahu stays in office , netanyahu said in a monday interview . asked by an interviewer with the israeli news site , nrg , if it was true that a palestinian nation would never be formed while he 's prime minister , netanyahu replied , `` indeed . '' his interview with nrg came as he courted conservative supporters a day before israelis head to the polls for national elections . `` anyone who is going to establish a palestinian state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israel , '' he said . `` this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years . '' netanyahu went on to say that any opponents on the left who might argue otherwise are `` sticking their head in the sand , time and time again . '' he further said a strong government led by his likud party is necessary to beat back international pressure to divide jerusalem and return israel to its pre-1967 borders , according to a jewish telegraphic agency report on the nrg interview . `` i do not give in , '' netanyahu told nrg . `` we stood fast against huge pressure , and we will continue to do so . '' following netanyahu 's interview , chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat , who is also a member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization , said the israeli prime minister 's stance is nothing new . `` netanyahu has done everything possible to bury the two-state solution , '' he said . `` netanyahu 's statement at the illegal settlement of har homa is a response to all those governments who tried to block palestinian diplomatic initiatives . he could n't have done that without counting on full impunity from the international community . now the world must learn its lesson and understand that impunity wo n't bring peace , only justice will . '' earlier in the day , netanyahu continued his efforts to drum up support during a campaign speech in the har homa neighborhood of jerusalem , which he boasted that he helped establish in 1997 , during his first prime ministerial term . israel considers har homa part of a unified jerusalem , while palestinians consider the neighborhood an illegal settlement . if he is re-elected , netanyahu said , he will continue to promote construction in jerusalem as a means of national security , he said . `` the pressure around this decision back then was enormous . but i insisted -- i ordered the construction and it paid off , '' he said . `` today , har homa is a flourishing neighborhood in which tens of thousands of israeli civilians are living . as we proved in the past , my friends in the likud party and i , we will keep jerusalem protected and keep developing it . '' opposition leaders isaac herzog and tzipi livni of the zionist union , he alleged , are `` ready to surrender to every dictate . '' livni , he said , has denounced previous calls for more construction in jerusalem 's jewish neighborhoods , while herzog would strive to establish a palestinian capital in east jerusalem . `` i will not let that happen , '' he said . `` my friends and i in the likud will keep jerusalem united in all its parts , and we will keep fortifying it so that dividing it will not be possible and it will always remain united . we will keep developing our eternal capital . '' a vote for herzog or livni is a vote for the establishment of `` hamastan , '' netanyahu said , referring to hamas , the islamist group which dominates gaza . he further alleged that his opponents would yield to international pressure and `` huge financial support coming from abroad , from left-leaning tycoons and foreign governments . '' he closed his speech saying , `` the meaning of this is simple : we will not be able to keep israel safe and secure and the terror against us that once emerged through these hills with machine guns will turn into missile fire .

'' there 's no judge , just someone who knows the parameters they 've decided for the match . the small audience is mostly made up of men , but it 's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside . `` when i saw this kind of fighting for the first time , i was quite shocked . i had never seen something like that before , and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close , '' said mazur , who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school . `` inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat . '' at first , mazur said , she shot the fight club in color , but the look of the blue mat and neon lights did n't satisfy her . she shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view , getting as close as she could to the action . `` it was not easy to work like that , because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable , '' she said , although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt . `` i had to be very careful not to get hit . fortunately , there are chairs on the side , so i could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet . '' for all the aggression built into fighting , mazur said , the project required a lot of sensitivity . she had to work quickly , and she did n't always know her subjects well . the bouts , the motivations , the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation . mazur said she had to examine her own limitations , questioning `` how far can i go ? do they trust me ? am i allowed to do that ? '' social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` i enjoy exploring new worlds , especially a world which exists in a gray area , '' she said . she also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside , too -- they 're mothers , partners , friends . their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives . even years later , the fight club is still running and is `` better than ever , '' mazur said . `` very often , i was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures , realizing what exactly happened there , '' mazur said . `` it is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and -lrb- an open mind -rrb- .

'' working with the approach of an artisan , pongo plays with light to create a certain magic in the aura of the people he portrays . it is a useful tool in a place with so many contrasts . `` i like to remain loyal to the principles of film development and darkrooms , '' said pongo , who shot `` the uncanny '' on a digital camera . `` the light is a combination of using flashes and taking advantage of the amazing presence of the sun . the humid atmosphere , fog and dust renders some interesting possibilities ... like a natural filter . '' pongo went back in 2013 and said his journey through the country is not over yet . `` i think i reached my objective , to embed into the daily life in the congo , which clearly transformed me , '' he said . `` i was allowed into the life of people who were former strangers ... and got a deeper understanding of what daily life in the congo could feel like . `` i was also deeply impressed to discover how much life there is in this country , how much more there is to discover , how complex it is to understand , and how much work that will require .

hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- taipei is fast becoming the go-to asian city for some of hollywood 's biggest hitters . martin scorsese is filming his latest opus `` silence '' there , and french director luc besson chose taipei over seven other asian cities for his sci-fi thriller `` lucy , '' starring scarlett johansson . and this may `` the walking dead '' star andrew lincoln will begin filming in the city for a movie project . tasked with attracting international film makers , jennifer jao , head of the taipei film commission , said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year , up from 56 in 2013 . `` we hope the whole island can be like a big studio , '' she told cnn while in hong kong thursday . it was n't always this way . for years , taiwan , while home to acclaimed filmmakers like edward yang and hou hsiao-hsien , was overlooked in favor of its ritzier neighbors hong kong , shanghai and tokyo . and even when hollywood came knocking , the city did n't always have its act together . the producers of `` mission impossible iii , '' released in 2006 , had wanted to film at taipei 101 , at that time the world 's tallest skyscraper . but faced with red tape and reluctance , they ended up choosing the 53-story shanghai bank of china tower for tom cruise 's memorable bungee jump . `` we lost an opportunity for the world to get to know taipei , '' says jao . jao 's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it was n't until director ang lee , who was born in taiwan , filmed the oscar-winning hit `` life of pi '' on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot . lee filmed the memorable and technically difficult scenes of a shipwrecked boy and a tiger at a purpose-built facility at abandoned airport in the taiwanese city of taichung . with its relatively unknown cityscape , taiwan can also function as a generic asian backdrop . the island , which was a japanese colony , is already being used as a stand-in for japan . japanese director takashi miike used taiwan 's high-speed rail system in a bullet-strewn action sequence for crime drama `` shield of straw , '' which competed at the cannes international film festival . japanese rail authorities turned him away . and scorsese 's `` silence , '' due to release in 2016 , is a historic drama about two jesuit priests who travel to japan . taiwan is also a popular alternative to china , where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene . hong kong director john woo used both taiwan and china as locations in `` the crossing . '' dubbed china 's `` titanic , '' it focuses on a ship that sank when the nationalist government fled china for taiwan in 1949 as the communists took over -- a sensitive period in chinese history . taiwan and china are still governed separately . chinese authorities asked woo to tone down the heroics of a nationalist soldier , according to the south china morning post -- not something that taiwan would ever require , says jao . the commission offers incentives for international film crews . up to $ 2 million is available per movie -- half of that as a cash subsidy . but just as important is the island 's versatility as a location , says jao . while many of the film crews are from neighboring asian countries , the city has hosted crews from latvia and germany , while the bbc shot some of its newly released drama `` x+y '' in the city . `` it 's a small island . within half an hour , you can go from the streets to the mountains to the sea .

'' the ceremony was followed the next day by a series of masterclasses held at turner house where guests heard from cnn producers and editors about how cnn international deals with data , its approach to social media and what it takes to produce a successful online video . award winners were then hosted at a special lunch by london bureau chief tommy evans and chief international correspondent christiane amanpour . the awards were an inspirational testament to the power of good journalism and everyone involved with the event was thrilled to host the winners for this special program of events . cnn journalist of the year 2015 and winner in the category radio : stephanie doetzer : `` take care , habibi '' -lrb- dradio wissen -rrb- . stories about the civil war in syria are often quite abstract . yet , a war is very real . it is not only about the destruction of residential areas and fighting militia . it is also about families that argue about what happens , about friends who do n't talk to each other anymore and relationships that fall apart . political life becomes private , and personal life becomes political -- for all syrians but also for those who feel connected with syria . `` this contribution is written as a first-person narrative that is very compelling and emotional . it forces you to see what is happening in syria , and there was no doubt that it had to win the award . the contribution has won our hearts by a long way , we are completely convinced , '' says jury member ingrid thurnher . photography : jelca kollatsch -lrb- `` houses without people and people without houses '' , ver.di publik -rrb- . the photo series by jelca kollatsch shows the effects of the financial crisis on people in spain who live in andalusia , the region with the country 's highest rates of unemployment and evictions . `` the contribution covers an important issue , and it tells a story , almost following the structure of a drama : with breathtaking rigor , the artist goes from the sources of the problem to the eviction of the people in the end , '' the jury said . online : christian salewski and felix rohrbeck -lrb- `` the gps chase . what happens with our waste ? '' , arte future -rrb- and trainees of deutsche welle : `` my granny , the regime and i '' -lrb- dw -rrb- . this year , the jury chose two winners in the category online : `` digital journalism has a lot to offer . the two prizewinners represent a different approach in an interesting way and show how journalism generally evolves with multimedia possibilities , '' explains the jury . in the first contribution , christian salewski und felix rohrbeck track the disposal of electronic scrap in germany and find out that it is n't always legal and fair . in the second contribution , a group of deutsche welle trainees asked their grandmothers from belarus , brazil , chile , china , kenya and germany about their personal experiences in times of dictatorship or autocracy . they created a multimedia online project with videos , words and images , combining the stories of the grandmothers with the history of the different countries . print : alexandra rojkov and jan ludwig -lrb- `` you think you can help me ? '' , der tagesspiegel -rrb- . the contribution of the two authors tells the personal story of an escape from syria and asks how far we would go in a safe country like germany to help people in war and crisis zones . `` the authors touch their audience by transferring the ongoing conflict in syria to the fate of two individuals , '' says jury chairman franz fischlin . tv : lukas augustin -lrb- `` unforgiven '' , ndr -rrb- . twenty years after the civil war in rwanda , the victims and the offenders live door to door . lukas augustin presents a documentary about the efforts made to foster forgiveness . the movie provides insight into the tangle of guilt and atonement in modern rwanda . `` this contribution is more than a tv documentary . it is a film about a country that deals with its own history in an incredibly spectacular and exceptional way , '' says jury member ingrid thurnher . the jury members of this year 's cnn journalist award were : franz fischlin -lrb- tagesschau host , editor and reporter srf -rrb- , frederik pleitgen -lrb- cnn senior international correspondent -rrb- , stefan plöchinger -lrb- editor-in-chief sueddeutsche.de & member of the editorial board süddeutsche zeitung -rrb- , ingrid thurnher -lrb- host and editor orf -rrb- , hans demmel -lrb- managing director n-tv -rrb- , daniel puntas bernet -lrb- editor-in-chief of the magazine reportagen -rrb- and jörg thadeusz -lrb- host , author , journalist -rrb- . about the cnn journalist award . the cnn journalist award is presented by cnn international to young foreign journalists . each year , it recognizes outstanding print , radio , tv , online and photographic work by young journalists . as well as awards for each category , an overall winner is named the `` cnn journalist of the year .

delhi -lrb- cnn -rrb- a court in new delhi wednesday summoned india 's former prime minister , manmohan singh , as a suspect in a trial over alleged irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks , a spokeswoman for the investigating agency told cnn . singh and his former government have repeatedly denied accusations they cost the treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue by selling coalfields to private companies , without allowing competitive bidding . the 82-year-old leader , who served as the nation 's prime minister for two successive terms until last year , was not named as a defendant in the original dossier of charges , said kanchan prasad , the spokeswoman for the central bureau of investigation -lrb- cbi -rrb- . nevertheless , the trial court summoned him and some other corporate leaders to testify in person on april 8 , she said . the case singh has been asked to appear for relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm some 10 years ago , when he was also guardian of the nation 's coal ministry . the summons has been issued under india 's anti-corruption law . singh said he was open to legal scrutiny . '' -lrb- i -rrb- am sure that the truth will prevail and i will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts . i have always said i am open for legal scrutiny . of course i am upset , but this is part of life , '' he said in a text message issued by his office . singh 's congress party also came to his defense . the former prime minister functioned with `` utmost probity and utmost transparency '' during his term , said senior congress party leader manish tiwari . he said singh 's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons , and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court . the oxford-cambridge educated singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in india as its finance minister in the 1990s . in his first term as prime minister , he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the united states that ended the south asian nation 's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market . his second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors . in 2012 , the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks . india depends heavily on coal for power . the fuel is abundantly available in the country , but that 's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in asia 's third-largest economy . for the current financial year , national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes , according to official figures . of it , at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports , coal minister piyush goyal told the indian parliament in december . the state-run monopoly coal india limited -lrb- cil -rrb- accounts for more than 80 % of the output . plans by current prime minister narendra modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently , when cil workers stopped work in january . the two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas , but forced the government to go slow on reforms .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in some ways , america 's president pilots our ship of state as a captain pilots a jumbo jet , and this analogy suggests one possible way to avoid a repeat of the germanwings massacre : give the plane 's flight crew certain powers akin to those given to america 's cabinet in the rare and terrifying situation when the president and vice president are at swords ' point . some background . both presidents and plane captains must be shielded from lunatics and terrorists . this is why airlines across the world hardened cockpit doors after 9/11 and why americans of all stripes are outraged by stories that the secret service on several occasions has failed to maintain proper security at the white house . both presidents and plane captains are human , and subject to all the frailties of humans , from temporary disabilities created by bathroom breaks -lrb- for pilots -rrb- and scheduled surgeries -lrb- for presidents -rrb- to sudden death . transitions in both the oval office and the cockpit should be made as smooth as possible . hence the need for a vice president at the ready , able to take over at a moment 's notice . the obvious aviation analogy here is the second pilot in the cockpit . in case of sudden death , the vice president or co-pilot simply takes over immediately . in case of a temporary disability -- say , a scheduled surgery under general anesthesia -- the president can hand over control to the vice president and then take back control when the disability ends . it is exactly what happened when president george w. bush underwent planned colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007 . on both occasions , bush handed the tiller to his trusted co-pilot , dick cheney , and then resumed control when ready , under rules clearly laid out by the constitution 's 25th amendment -- an amendment drafted and ratified after the shocking assassination of president john f. kennedy . but what happens if a president is unable to predict his own future disability , or unable to recognize a genuine disability when it arises ? the 25th amendment allows the vice president to take over control in this situation , but to do so , the vice president needs the support of a majority of cabinet officers -- officials previously appointed by the president himself and thus unlikely to support any inappropriate vice presidential power grab . on a jumbo jet , a co-pilot may likewise take over in certain situations . but current airplane architecture fails to use the crew in the optimal way . when one officer has barricaded himself in the cockpit and the other officer is banging on the door demanding entry , current airplane design enables the man in the cockpit unilaterally to block the demand for entrance with the flick of a switch . think of this as an absolute veto . -lrb- some airlines get around the problem with a rule that a flight attendant must replace a pilot so that there will always be at least two people in the cockpit . -rrb- . but suppose instead that airlines were to borrow sensibly a page from america 's constitution . the man in the cockpit could temporarily block entrance , but this veto could be overridden if -- and only if -- the door-banging officer is backed by a majority of the flight attendants . the need for some sort of secure cockpit lock is obvious . perhaps the officer banging on the door has gone mad , or is being held hostage at knifepoint , or is a terrorist mole . but the need for an override is also obvious . perhaps the man in the cockpit is the bad guy . and just as america 's cabinet officers are well-positioned to decide any dispute between a president and vice president wrestling over the key to the oval office , so too with an airplane 's crew : the cockpit lock button could be electronically overridden whenever a majority of flight attendants punched in their own individual passcodes in sequence on a keypad somewhere outside the cockpit door . this proposed technological fix will not prevent all future tragedies . no human system is foolproof . but giving the crew a collective key brings more human minds into the equation -- as does the 25th amendment 's rule empowering the cabinet to resolve certain terrifying disputes at the highest level of executive power . on planes , as in a constitutional democracy , there is often safety in numbers .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as a person-of-color , african-american , veteran minority journalist and longtime enthusiast of all things `` daily show , '' i am of course as happy , proud and thrilled as the wife of a successful apollo astronaut over the impending ascension of trevor noah , the biracial comedian from south africa , to jon stewart 's anchor chair on what 's believed by many to be the most trusted half-hour of news and information in america . as a person who believes in fair play and equal opportunity for all , i am also moved to wonder when a woman will get the chance to preside over a talk show after sunset ? look . i do n't mean to sound ungrateful . after generations of near-to-total invisibility on mass media airwaves , it 's bracing to find a whole one-hour block of high-profile cable television infotainment anchored by men who look like me . indeed , in pushing forth both noah and larry wilmore , the writer , comic and erstwhile national black correspondent for `` the daily show , '' to preside over both halves of comedy central 's much-coveted 11 p.m.-to-midnight bloc , stewart is acknowledging what the mainstream of the country truly is : i.e. not as pale-faced as it once thought it was . and so far , wilmore 's `` the nightly show , '' which premiered earlier this year as a replacement for the very different `` daily show '' companion once hosted by stephen colbert , is gradually establishing its own identity as an equally cheeky hybrid of sketch satire and celebrity forum with its own multicultural flavor . still , one does wonder what happened to the groundswell of support building among `` daily show '' constituents for jessica williams , a three-year veteran of the show and an early favorite for stewart 's spot after he announced last month he was leaving . williams , who is black , tweeted back to her supporters her grateful opinion that she was `` extremely under-qualified for the job . '' maybe , but what about samantha bee ? she 's the `` most senior correspondent '' for `` the daily show '' and is taking her penchant for performance artistry and provocation to tbs , where she 'll create her own satiric news franchise . her track record bodes well for her prospects there . but it 's difficult to find any evidence that she was considered a stewart successor -- though her announcement that she was leaving the show came a month after stewart 's . besides bee ? no one , least of all those affiliated with comedy central , have disclosed any candidates besides noah . there was even less buzz about the stewart opening than colbert 's a year ago , during which time there were many willing to say that now was the time to finally give a woman a shot at late-night tv for the first time since the late joan rivers ' fox network effort , `` the late show '' came in 1987 -- and went in 1988 . and yes , we are n't neglecting chelsea handler , whose `` chelsea lately '' was for seven seasons on the e! network a bawdier late-night alternative to whatever letterman , stewart and others were putting down beyond prime-time . she 's supposed to start streaming a new show through netflix sometime next year . so one supposes she 's pretty busy . it will happen , perhaps sooner than one now expects . look how long it took before diane sawyer and katie couric were given their shots to anchor evening news broadcasts on abc and cbs respectively . hmmm ... wonder what they 're doing after 11 p.m. these days .

'' universal television will produce . casting for both the nbc telecast and cirque 's broadway production will be announced at a later date . `` the wiz '' is adapted from l. frank baum 's `` the wonderful wizard of oz , '' with a book by brown and music and lyrics by charlie smalls . the production opened on broadway in 1975 at the majestic theatre and won seven tonys , including best musical . it ran for four years . tv ratings : ` peter pan live ! ' falls from ` sound of music ' `` the wiz '' is a retelling of `` oz '' in an african-american/multicultural context . it was adapted as a film in 1978 starring diana ross , michael jackson , lena horne and richard pryor . it centers on dorothy , a young woman from kansas , who is swept up in a tornado and relocated to a fantasy world inhabited by munchkins , good and bad witches , and flying monkeys . she eventually takes a path down a yellow brick road to find a wizard who can help her go home . along the way , she meets a scarecrow , tin man and cowardly lion , who all learn to help one another . nbc chief tackles bill cosby , live musicals and comedy woes . for nbc , `` the wiz '' combines two of tv 's biggest trends : live programming and the growing appetite for diversity -- both in terms of casting and programming that best reflect society today . it comes as networks continue to look to live programming like sporting events and awards shows in a bid to break through the clutter in a crowded dvr landscape . in terms of diversity , the success of fox 's hip-hop drama `` empire '' and other scripted entries including `` black-ish '' as well as `` fresh off the boat , '' `` cristela , '' `` scandal '' and `` how to get away with murder '' have prompted a crush of diverse castings again this pilot season . `` the wiz '' was one of two productions nbc had been eyeing -lrb- alongside `` a few good men '' and `` music man '' -rrb- . greenblatt confirmed in january that he had optioned both properties . © 2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- tina fey 's follow-up to `` 30 rock '' is getting a lot of attention , not all of it good . her new netflix series , `` the unbreakable kimmy schmidt , '' is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes . the show , which had been picked up by nbc but ultimately dropped , stars ellie kemper -lrb- `` bridesmaids , '' `` the office '' -rrb- as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader : not exactly fodder for humor , on its surface . after she 's released from an indiana bunker , kimmy moves to new york to start a life , and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world , her seventh-grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals . since its debut , buzzfeed has declared that the show has a `` major race problem , '' and others criticized its treatment of an asian character named dong . slate says that the critics `` are n't wrong ... but they are missing the point . '' `` tina fey 's high-wire act is all about the alchemy of making it ok to laugh at big , heavy issues -- like kidnapped women , the experience of undocumented vietnamese immigrants , and people with native american ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch , '' arthur chu wrote on slate . the daily dot 's jacqueline keeler wrote that she once hid her native american past , just like kimmy 's employer , a wealthy woman played by jane krakowski . keeler said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised fey 's `` genius '' writing . but tituss burgess , who plays kimmy 's black gay roommate , titus -lrb- whom some have called a stereotype -rrb- , says the whole controversy is `` ridiculous .

moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- in his first substantive comments since kremlin critic boris nemtsov 's death , russian president vladimir putin on wednesday called the killing a `` disgrace '' and lashed out at what he called `` extremists '' and protesters . nemtsov had been one of putin 's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the president 's government . the 55-year-old opposition leader was gunned down friday night in moscow as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters -lrb- 330 feet -rrb- from the kremlin with his girlfriend , ukrainian model anna duritskaya , 23 . his slaying spurred thousands to rally in his honor in moscow , with many calling him a true russian patriot at his funeral tuesday . nemtsov is n't the first of putin 's critics to turn up dead , with others including anna politkovskaya -lrb- who was fatally shot -rrb- and alexander litvinenko -lrb- who was poisoned -rrb- . the kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it 's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths . the russian leader has condemned nemtsov 's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate , the kremlin has said . he also wrote to nemtsov 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice . yet those expressions came in kremlin statements . wednesday was the first day putin spoke at length on the subject , remarks that were reported by state media outlets . referring to `` the daring killing of boris nemtsov in the very heart of our capital city , '' he said , `` russia should be made secure , at last , from the disgrace and tragedies of -lrb- this -rrb- kind . '' the president added , according to the official tass news agency , `` the most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes , including those having political motives .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- buddy elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin anne frank . his death monday brought back memories for me . we met three years ago in an atlanta hotel conference room . he and his wife , gerti , were touring the united states to promote a new book . i could tell instantly that he was related to anne . his face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though i was meeting her in person . `` anne frank 's family '' had just been published , based on 14 boxes of letters , postcards , photos and documents that gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in basel . elias told me that it was n't just anne who loved to write ; everyone in the family did . the 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-semitism . that day in atlanta , i listened to elias tell me about loved ones he lost . he told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral switzerland when world war ii broke out . i thought back to our conversation thursday when i learned the news of elias ' death . he died peacefully at his home in basel , switzerland , at 90 , said an announcement posted on the website of anne frank fonds , the foundation that elias headed . like millions of people who read `` the diary of anne frank , '' i was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family 's courage . anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the nazis in the secret annex of an amsterdam apartment . i was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975 . after the family was discovered , they were sent to auschwitz . later , anne and her sister margot were taken to bergen-belsen , where they both died in march 1945 . her father , otto frank , was the sole survivor of the family , one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from auschwitz . in the course of my two hours with elias , i learned new things about the young , jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world . she called him bernd , short for bernhard , elias ' formal name . in his youth , elias was an actor and a skater with holiday on ice . he was her first cousin and 4 years older . they adored one another . `` bernd , maybe we can skate as a pair together someday , '' anne wrote in january 1941 from amsterdam . `` but i know i 'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are . '' in another letter , anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue , fur-trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with elias . `` she never did get to do that , '' elias said . on his 17th birthday in 1942 , she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met . it was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other . but it turned out to be her last to him , and he preserved it like a relic , as proof of his cousin 's affection , as something to treasure . `` that was the last sign of life i had with anne , '' elias told me . after the war , otto frank searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate . he published anne 's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film . he created the foundation in her name in 1963 . the first edition of the diary was in dutch . elias told me he had to wait several years for a german language edition before he could read it . that was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate . by the time he read her words , he had not seen anne in many years . in his mind , he treasured the image of a spunky girl who loved the jack-in-the-box puppet shows elias staged and played hide-and-seek . `` anne , '' he said , `` was always good at hiding . '' i wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words . otto frank kept alive his daughter 's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to elias . he was devoted to the task until the day he died . in 2012 , he helped create the frank family centre in frankfurt , where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public , according to the anne frank foundation . elias was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world . anne frank never gave up on humanity , despite everything she endured . it was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary . in elias , i saw that same goodness .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- when kyesha smith wood heard that her teen daughters were rude to another patron who asked them to be quiet at a local movie theater , she was furious . the birmingham , alabama , mom made them write an apology note , but she did n't know who should get it . that 's why wood posted a plea on her local community 's closed facebook page on saturday to track down the woman , according to cnn affiliate wmba . the jefferson county 's sheriff 's office reposted her note the same night , and the post has been liked more than 250,000 times . `` my son later told me , much to my humiliation and embarrassment , that my girls were rude and obnoxious during the movie . the woman i 'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful , '' wood wrote on her facebook post . `` after the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her , '' wrote wood , who asked the woman to contact her . `` this rude , disrespectful , and awful behavior is unacceptable and they owe you an apology . '' wood promised that her daughters would pay for another movie for the family out of their allowance . the woman wood was trying to reach is rebecca boyd , who saw the sheriff 's department post and contacted her . `` the note from their mom brought me to tears and shows there is still good people in the world , '' boyd wrote on the sheriff 's department facebook page . `` i have no hard feelings towards them and i am proud of their parents . the girls are not not bad ... they are children . glad they are learning a lesson . i hope if my teenagers are out and they act up ... i hope someone says something to them . '' wood called boyd the real hero of the story . `` she took it upon herself to correct my girls and nobody else did .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- ryan reynolds gave us a sneak peek at his new costume last week , and followed it up with a first look on video . the actor posed on a bearskin rug to show off how he looks as masked marvel character deadpool in a post that quickly got positive responses from fans on social media . the photo is a parody of burt reynolds ' famous nude image from a 1972 issue of cosmopolitan and is very much in keeping with deadpool 's wisecracking , tongue-in-cheek persona . -lrb- here 's the original , in case you were born after 1972 or chose to delete the image from your mind . -rrb- . deadpool 's costume , a favorite among comic book fans and convention cosplayers , includes a mask that covers the entire face , so we might not see the face of 2010 's sexiest man for much of the movie . reynolds played deadpool in 2009 's `` x-men origins : wolverine , '' but he never wore the famous red and black attire . instead , he wore an unremarkable black suit bearing none of the hallmarks of the costume worn in the comics . as the vanity shot indicates , reynolds will be fully suited when returns to the role in first the feature-length `` deadpool , '' scheduled for release in 2016 . in response to skepticism online who was beneath the mask , screenwriter rhett reese confirmed via twitter that reynolds was indeed in the suit . then as a special treat for april fools ' day , reynolds was `` interviewed '' by `` extra '' host mario lopez , about the debate over whether the movie should be rated pg-13 or r . the ultraviolent deadpool would seem to lend himself to an r rating , but reynolds settled all that in memorable fashion , `` killing '' lopez in the process .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- in a strongly worded letter , the white house saturday told senate foreign relations chairman bob corker -lrb- r-tn -rrb- a bill he is drafting would likely have a `` profoundly negative impact '' on the ongoing negotiations between the u.s. and iran over tehran 's nuclear program . corker is working on legislation that would force the obama administration to submit any deal reached with iran for a vote by congress . the white house earlier threatened to veto such a measure . white house chief of staff denis mcdonough , in the three page letter released publicly saturday evening , told corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with iran by `` emboldening iranian hard-liners , inviting a counter-productive response from the iranian majiles -lrb- majles , the parliament -rrb- ; differentiating the u.s. position from our allies in the negotiations ; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal . '' as the u.s. and iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week , there has been a growing debate between republicans on capitol hill and the obama administration about how much authority congress has regarding the fate of the agreement . `` the legislation you have introduced in the senate goes well beyond ensuring that congress has a role to play in any deal with iran . instead , the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that congress must vote to ` approve ' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the president , '' mcdonough wrote . the chief of staff said that only congress can terminate the existing iran sanctions that are included in laws , but the president can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally . one of the major issues between the u.s. and iran is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions . `` if congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal , it will create divisions within the international community , putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure iran . put simply , it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions , while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions '' now in place , mcdonough said in his letter . for his part , corker on sunday released a statement : `` on this issue where congress has played such a vital role , i believe it is very important that congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented . '' corker also urged the president not to go to the united nations for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on iran , as reuters reported was being considered . `` enabling the united nations to consider an agreement or portions of it , while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable congress to do the same , is a direct affront to the american people and seeks to undermine congress ' appropriate role , '' he wrote . the chief of staff told corker , `` the administration 's request to the congress is simple : let us complete the negotiations before the congress acts on legislation '' and added `` we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the united states . '' mcdonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to iran 's leadership and signed by 47 republican senators . corker did not sign it . the letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval . it has generated much controversy . it also drew rebuttal from iran 's foreign minister , who called it a propaganda ploy . on sunday , iran 's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said the letter signed by the senators tarnished washington 's reputation internationally , according to state-run tasnim news agency . he said it showed that the united states is untrustworthy , and he advised current negotiators to be wary . mcdonough also said the letter 's premise was incorrect . `` non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with iran ... are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval , '' mcdonough said . secretary of state john kerry , who heads back to switzerland on sunday for more talks with iranian representatives , again blasted that letter from the 47 republicans . `` it is a direct interference with negotiations in the executive department , '' he said at a news conference in egypt . `` it is completely without precedent , and it is almost inevitable it will raise questions in the minds of the folks with whom we are negotiating .

peshawar , pakistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- a former lawyer for the doctor who helped the cia look for osama bin laden has been shot dead in northwest pakistan , police said . unidentified gunmen attacked the lawyer , samiullah afridi , in his car near the city of peshawar on tuesday , said mian saeed , a police superintendent in peshawar . two different militant groups claimed responsibility for the killing . the lawyer had represented dr. shakeel afridi , who was convicted of treason in 2012 by a pakistani tribal court and is now serving a 23-year prison sentence . the two men are not related . the doctor helped the cia set up a fake vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect dna samples from relatives of bin laden in an effort to verify his presence in a compound in the pakistani city of abbottabad . the qaeda leader was killed in a u.s. raid on the compound in may 2011 . it was unclear which of the two groups claiming responsibility for the attack was actually behind it . fahad marwat , a spokesman for the militant group jundallah , told cnn that afridi was on the group 's hit list . but ehsanullah ehsan , a spokesman for a faction of the pakistani taliban , said his group had carried out the assassination because samiullah afridi defended the doctor , whom he described as `` a friend '' of bin laden 's killers . cnn national security analyst peter bergen said jundallah is `` kind of a splinter group '' of the pakistani taliban that 's `` been around for a long time . '' `` they 're extremely violent , '' he said . `` they 've been killing all sorts of religious minorities in pakistan . '' last month , the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a shiite mosque in the city of rawalpindi . bergen said dr. afridi is `` a very unpopular figure in pakistan '' because of the perception that he was involved in helping find bin laden . `` and his lawyer , by extension , would also be seen as an unpopular person because of that perception , '' he said . but bergen said he did n't think the doctor played a key role in the hunt for bin laden . `` the idea was the doctor and his staff would take dna samples from the bin laden kids as part of this ` vaccination program , ' '' he said . `` that never happened because the kids never came out . '' although dr. afridi was working for u.s. intelligence , `` the cia was n't telling the doctor , you 're helping us find bin laden , '' bergen said . after the killing of bin laden , health workers administering polio vaccinations have come to be viewed with suspicion by many pakistanis . the vaccination teams have repeatedly been targeted by militants . the latest instance came wednesday when unidentified attackers killed one polio vaccination worker and wounded another in bajaur agency in northwestern pakistan , local authorities said . journalist zahir shah reported from peshawar , and cnn 's jethro mullen wrote from hong kong . cnn 's sophia saifi and journalist saleem mehsud contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- three florida police officers were fired and a fourth resigned after exchanging a series of racially offensive text messages and a video that portrayed president barack obama in a derogatory way , fort lauderdale police said . jason holding , james wells and christopher sousa were terminated after a five-month internal affairs investigation found sustained department misconduct , conduct unbecoming of a police officer and engaging in `` conduct prejudicial to the good of the order of the police department . '' a fourth officer , alex alvarez , resigned but authorities said friday that he would have been fired had he not done so . in the text message exchanges , the former officers used racially derogatory terms to refer to people they encountered while on duty , included racially insensitive material from the film , `` django unchained , '' and talked about getting drunk and `` killing n ***** , '' according to investigative documents . the men allegedly criticized co-workers , including african-americans , making crude comments about their grammar , appearance and work ethic . one message referred to an entire shift as `` lazy f **** , '' the documents state . alvarez created a faux movie trailer with the title `` the hoods , '' with offensive language and images of obama , the ku klux klan and african-americans . `` there was no criminal behavior detected during this investigation , however , the four officers ' conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior in the fort lauderdale police department , '' chief franklin adderley told reporters . `` its attempt was to damage the image of our agency and i just hope that the people and the public realize that we 're not going to tolerate it and anyone that 's engaged in this behavior will be addressed immediately , '' he said . in a statement , the fort lauderdale fraternal order of police said the officers deserve their due process , cnn affiliate wsvn reported . `` the fraternal order of police is a multicultural organization which does not tolerate racism , '' the group 's president , jack lokeinsky , said in the statement . `` our officers take great pride in our commitment to diversity . our dedicated officers have positive relationships with residents in every community we serve . '' the officers worked in a predominantly african-american neighborhood . `` i am very disappointed , disgusted and shocked by this incident , '' mayor jack seiler said . `` the inappropriate racist behavior exhibited by those involved is unacceptable and reprehensible , it violates the trust we place in our law enforcement officers , it damages the bond we have established in our community and undermines the standards in which each and every city employee is held accountable , '' seiler said at a news conference . police officials were alerted of the existence of offensive material by alvarez 's ex-fiancee , who discovered it when the couple agreed to check each others ' phones , according to the documents . the woman told police she thought their behavior was wrong , but feared he would hurt her if she told anyone . after the 10-month relationship ended , she went to the authorities . adderley said that four officers had not exhibited a pattern of race-related complaints . holding was recently disciplined with a two-day suspension for mishandling property of a suspect . the police department is implementing a mandatory `` diversity class '' for officers and a screening process for new hires , said adderley .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` attenzione , the wine ! '' that is an old punchline in the weir home , thanks to plastic cups of chianti , a low bridge and a gondolier named marco . his concerned bark broke the spell as my wife and i smooched and gaped , moon-eyed dorks on our first night in venice . when i told my dad i was taking my wife to italy for our first anniversary , he snorted . `` where you gon na take her for your 10th ? the moon ? '' he was right . it was perfect . pigeons in san marco , sunset over the grand canal , bellinis and cheeseburgers at harry 's . venice entered our bloodstream that trip . but in the years since , i 've heard very different stories from disappointed folks back from their first trip to la serenissima because the city of water and love now has too much of both . too much water , and way too many lovers . because this impossible city of palazzos and cathedrals is built atop wooden posts driven into the muddy floor of a lagoon , venice has been slowly sinking since casanova canoodled down its canals . when aquifers were tapped to build massive petrochemical plants on the nearby mainland , venice sank faster . and then folks noticed that the sea level was on a slow but steady rise . in the 1920s , there were about 400 incidents of acqua alta , or high water , when the right mix of tides and winds drives the liquid streets up into homes and shops in the lowers parts of the city . by the 1990s , there were 2,400 incidents -- and new records are set every year . but , the italians have a plan . it is called the mose project . mose is an acronym for `` experimental electromechanical module , '' but it is also the italian word for moses , a guy known for parting the sea and protecting the faithful . it 's a system of 78 massive gates mounted to hinges on the ocean floor . the gates are filled with air , and designed to rise and create a temporary sea wall . since the plan was hatched , low-lying cities from miami to mumbai have taken a keen interest to see if the idea can work . everybody is still waiting : mose is now 10 years behind schedule , and $ 5 billion over budget . and on one early morning in 2014 , police rounded up 35 people at the highest levels of mose , including giorgio orsoni , the mayor of venice . while several went to prison on plea bargains , the now-former mayor is fighting charges of corruption and kickbacks . but while i went back to venice to do a story on rising water , instead i found a surprising drama about the rising tide of humanity . people know venice is special and fragile , so they come -- to the tune of 20 million tourists a year . meanwhile , the watery headaches and cost of living has created a mass exodus of native venetians : 100,000 have moved to the mainland in a single generation , and around 60,000 remain . on a busy summer day , in the most popular section of the city , tourists can outnumber venetians 600-1 . in manhattan , that number is 8-1 . when a cruise ship dumps thousands of people into venice at once , they squeeze down jammed medieval streets where purveyors of overpriced pizza and cheap masks have replaced the shops of artists and artisans . each year , more people come . each year , less get to enjoy the city we found on that first magical night . people have been worrying about the impending death of venice for centuries , but the place is in trouble , now more than ever . and in an age of rising seas and exploding populations , venice is a test . a test to preserve beauty , history and harmony from the greatest threats : time , tide and greed .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it was always going to take an extraordinary performance from a very talented swimmer to beat michael phelps at his favorite event in an olympic final . for more than a decade , the great american had vanquished all comers in the 200 meters butterfly on both the world and olympic stage , but then along came chad le clos . when the south african chased down phelps in the final 50 meters of the race to snatch a dramatic fingertip victory by 0.05 seconds he created one of the defining moments of the 2012 london olympics . as a 12-year-old , le clos had gazed into his television set at home in durban watching in awe as phelps , widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all-time , won six olympic gold medals at athens in 2004 . so perhaps it 's not surprising that lining up alongside his hero in an olympic final eight years later took on a slightly surreal air . `` my dream was always to swim like michael phelps so when i raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling , '' le clos tells cnn 's human to hero series . `` when i touched at 150 -lrb- meters -rrb- i think i was 1.5 meters behind him . when i turned i actually looked at him underwater and i thought i was him -- i know it sounds absolutely crazy , but i saw myself as him going past someone else . '' `` i remembered how he used to come off the last turn and , you know , smoke everyone ... i thought , he 's done this for so many years and i remembered that when i was swimming . i do n't know what it was but it was magical . '' the mind-altering moment quickly morphed into a life-changing experience for the then 20-year-old who edged out phelps in the final stroke . `` it was such a huge moment for south africa . obviously , to represent your country is a huge honor but to beat michael phelps at the olympics was amazing , '' he says . `` as a young kid everyone wants to be like their heroes but you do n't actually think one day that you 're going to beat them . '' the remarkable victory was memorable not just for le clos ' reactions -- which went from joy to disbelief immediately after the race -- but for those of his father bert , whose elated response and subsequent tv interview have become an enduring part of the swimmer 's story . the excitable tribute to his `` down-to-earth , beautiful boy , '' which included repeated mentions of the word `` unbelievable , '' touched the hearts of viewers and turned le clos senior into something of a household name himself . `` i never knew my father was such a celebrity until like five , six days after the games -- i was so wrapped up in -lrb- my own -rrb- bubble , '' le clos explains . `` we were walking down the street and everyone was taking photos of me , but i could n't find my dad , and i saw him and there were a line of people taking photos of him and i was like : ` dad ! you are stealing my thunder here . c'mon ! ' it was incredible . `` everywhere he goes he 's that famous dad and that 's amazing because he really is . nothing was put on for the cameras -- that 's how he is back home . to my other brothers and sister he 's a great dad . '' success in the pool has been rich reward for bert , who steered the chad towards swimming when a football career looked more likely . `` my parents were hugely influential in helping me make decisions throughout my life , especially my sporting career , '' he says . `` when i was young i played football until i was about 13 or 14 years old -- i played for the state team -lrb- natal -rrb- . i had to make a decision and my dad realized that i was a better swimmer , even though my family had a football background . `` ninety-nine percent of fathers would have told their son to play football ... i still thank him every day for helping me make that decision . '' there is now another le clos in the pool -- teenager jordan is hoping to follow in his brother 's large footsteps , having already competed at south africa 's national championships . `` you know , 2020 is very important to me , '' says chad . `` hopefully my brother can make the olympics then and swim in the same relay team . '' originally a breaststroker , le clos switched to butterfly after he tore both his abductor muscles -lrb- in the groin -rrb- in 2008 when he was 16 years old . `` butterfly movement is really different . it 's unlike freestyle or other strokes where it 's very , very technical . i compare it to dancing -- i 'm a terrible dancer ! -- it 's about getting your hips right , your kick is very important . i just really enjoy it . it 's a fast stroke , so i guess the injury was a blessing in disguise for me . '' while swimming 's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline , le clos has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the short-course world championships in doha last year -- and the 400m medley -lrb- butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke and freestyle -rrb- at the 2010 commonwealth games in delhi . but it is butterfly where he has dominated in recent years . after pipping phelps in the 200m in london , le clos had to settle for silver behind the american in the 100m , but he has n't missed a stroke since . a 100m and 200m double at the 2013 world championships in barcelona was followed by gold at the commonwealth games in glasgow , scotland last august . he capped a brilliant 2014 in december with three more titles -lrb- 50m , 100m and 200m -rrb- at the short-course worlds in doha before being crowned fina world male swimmer of the year -- an award he is incredibly proud of . `` the olympic gold will always be there and it will be the most outstanding moment of my life , but to win the 2014 swimmer of the year award was up there . not many people have won the ballon d'or of swimming , so it was a very special moment for me . '' for le clos , who turns 23 in april , the best is almost certainly yet to come with another olympics fast approaching . he concedes that it will be `` very , very difficult '' to get anywhere near phelps ' record haul of 18 olympic gold medals -lrb- and 22 overall -rrb- , but he may get the chance to race him one more time . phelps , who announced his retirement following the 2012 london games , made a shock return to the pool last year although things have n't exactly gone to plan -- the `` baltimore bullet '' is serving a six-month ban imposed by usa swimming after he was arrested for drink-driving last september . the ban has put his planned appearance at this year 's fina world championships in doubt , but phelps is still hopeful of qualifying for his fifth olympics in 2016 . `` i really , really hope that he and his team decide to swim in rio , i really believe it will be great , '' le clos told reuters last year . `` it 's added motivation for me ... with michael back , it 's really sparked my fire , so to speak . i do n't think he will be worse in rio , i think he 'll be back where he wants to be . he 's a champion in all respects but i believe i can beat him again . '' if he can , then le clos will have taken a giant step towards his ultimate aim of swimming and sporting immortality . `` i want to cement myself in the sport as one of the greats . in swimming terms , i want people to remember chad le clos -- the guy that not only beat michael phelps , but who is the best fast swimmer of all time , '' he says . `` in south africa we have a rich history of great champions -- rugby players , cricket players , a lot of great golfers -- so i 'm among really tough competition , but i believe that after 2016 and 2020 i can hopefully be the greatest .

'' i want to return so that i can teach . as a child , i was inspired by my third-grade teacher , who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world . i think it 's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students , but i want to try . although i hope to follow in my teacher 's footsteps , my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home , by a war that has driven me here , by tuition costs in jordan that are prohibitively expensive . being away from home presents many challenges . you feel like a stranger in a foreign place . you 're not among people who know you , or who want to know you . as a syrian refugee , it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed , and i 've no money to complete my studies . overnight , my dreams changed . in one moment i was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying english , of becoming a schoolteacher . in the next , it all feels lost . it 's impossible to work , impossible to study . we hope to meet our needs today , not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow . in syria , i was responsible to my parents , now i am responsible for them . i dreamed of being a teacher , but because my parents are old , i must try each week just to protect them , to cover their basic needs of shelter , food and medicine . i needed some way to support my family . while most syrians are not permitted to work , we can volunteer . i found a role with the poverty-fighting organization care in the urban refugee center in east amman , jordan , where i earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work . i have enjoyed it so much . after working there , i have become more social , and no longer feel isolated . it 's not like sitting at home , feeling powerless , losing confidence , wondering what i can do to help my family , to help my people . instead , i feel empowered . i recognize my potential . and , because of that , i refuse to give up on my dreams . my hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so i can continue my studies . i want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching syrian children . resettling could help shape my future so that i can help shape theirs . one day , i will tell them of the crisis we faced in the syria that i left . we must be aware of this history , and learn from it . we must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard . change starts with them . and it starts with us . each person has the right to pursue an education , to meet their most basic needs , to express themselves . when those rights are stifled , so , too , is a person 's potential , her opportunities , her power to create a better world , and in my case , a better syria . my question to the u.s. people and the international community is this : imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours : what do you believe in then ? what do you cling to ? the answer , i think , is : your dreams . we all have them . mine , for the time being , have been deferred .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a 17-year-old male fatally shot an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new american hometown , targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside , dallas police said friday . authorities do n't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim , ahmed al-jumaili , dallas police maj. jeff cotner said reporters , nor do they believe he knew al-jumaili 's ethnicity . and they have n't given any indication al-jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend 's apartment , if that in fact happened . cotner said that , while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs , `` we -lrb- have been -rrb- unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment . '' what police do believe , based on witness testimony and other evidence , is that the teenager shot and killed al-jumaili , for whatever reason . `` when he saw mr. al-jumaili and their family , he targeted them , he shot at them with intent , '' cotner said of the suspect , who is under arrest . `` and as mr. al-jumaili ran back toward his apartment , he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire . '' dallas police named the suspected shooter , though cnn is not identifying him yet since he 's a minor and it 's not clear if he 'll be charged as an adult . the teen turns 18 in may , police said . until the fatal shots ended al-jumalli 's life , march 4 had been a day of fun and joy for al-jumaili and his family . the 36-year-old , who had immigrated to the united states 20 days earlier , joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a dallas apartment complex amid the snow . `` just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us , '' cotner said . then came the gunshots and al-jumaili 's cry , `` i 'm hit ! '' a few hours later , the iraqi immigrant was dead . three days later , a dallas detective found surveillance footage from a nearby elementary school showing four people coming from the apartment complex . the black-and-white soundless surveillance video shows one person apparently carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person seemingly carrying a hand gun , dallas police officer monica cordova said . approximately 13 seconds later , another person comes into view and passes by the camera , followed by a fourth individual who is walking , she said . then , on tuesday , a witness walked into the richardson , texas , police station and provided a nickname of a possible suspect -- kaca . that nickname eventually led to the 17-year-old police believe shot al-jumaili . investigators interviewed him for the first time thursday , at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend 's apartment . then , authorities got the ok to search his apartment and found an unfired rifle cartridge , cotner said . the teen was brought to dallas police headquarters for another interview , and he changed his story . yes , he had been at the scene of al-jumaili 's killing . but no , he had n't done it . yet that 's not what someone who 'd been with him said . according to cotner , this witness said he saw al-jumaili taking pictures in the snow , . `` the witness stated that he observed -lrb- the suspect -rrb- raise the rifle , '' the police major said . '' ... the witness then heard one shot , followed by several more . '' then all of them bolted . the incident caused waves in dallas ' muslim community . while police have n't given any indication this was a hate crime , though alia salem -- executive director of the council on american-islamic relations in the dallas and fort worth area -- noted `` a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against muslims . '' speaking friday on behalf of al-jumaili 's family , salem expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said `` our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death . '' `` we just want to see justice happen here , '' she said . `` and this is the first step in that . '' cnn 's pat st. claire and vivian kuo contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- as a well-traveled photographer , pieter ten hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps . but he never experienced any like the mayo camp , which is outside the sudanese capital of khartoum . ten hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for emergency , a humanitarian group from italy . he also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there . his hopes were dashed , however , when he was told he could n't photograph outside the hospital compound . `` i had very , very hard restrictions from the sudanese government . ... they are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay , '' ten hoopen said . with no freedom of movement , much like the refugees themselves , ten hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in africa . with the help of refugee hospital workers , he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available . the studio quickly became a sensation . once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken , lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken . one by one , these people sat solemnly to be photographed . it was their time to be acknowledged . there was gravity , earnestness to the way they posed . this was the moment their story would be registered . `` this was one of the reasons why i built the studio : to get more material and more narratives from the people , '' ten hoopen said . the project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees . the photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp , some have been there for decades . women wearing the traditional sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped . from the muslim north , women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the christian south , who we also see represented in these photos . whether from sudan , south sudan or eritrea , the faces become , individually and collectively , a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the horn of africa . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . the word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict , their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs . ten hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely . `` they got very serious , they sat down upright . ... i tried to say as little as possible , '' he said . `` i do believe in their own expressions , their own narrative ... and their unique perspective . '' the studio had a comforting effect . it was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital . it gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye , giving each person their deserved attention . aesthetically , it created an aura around each person , beaming light on his or her personal narrative . it had some uplifting effects as well . `` i always try to put some extra thought to -lrb- projects -rrb- . so i build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the african continent or in europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way , '' ten hoopen said . he said some patients at the hospital `` had being laying there for months in their room . ... then you take them out , it 's a little treat to get them out of their own misery . ... that 's why you see the line growing , because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio . '' ten-month-old buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio . having just had a blood test for malaria , she clearly looked uneasy . gazing to someone who is holding her hand , her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength . hawa haranan , 40 , came from the war-torn darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital . as she wears a simple tobe , one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare . her life and struggle , as with the other individuals photographed , is accounted for with the testimony of a camera . ten hoopen used tilt-shift lenses , which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography . `` i really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded , i think , with respect and it was a very serious moment , '' he said . `` it 's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you . '' how did ten hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees , some severely traumatized and living in fear ? `` it was n't hard , '' he said . `` i just told them to relax and have fun . `` kids sometimes got nervous , and i do n't blame them . i am a tall , white , bald european guy . ... i am not only funny to look at , but it is hot in that country so i am usually very red when i am photographing . ... i have tattoos everywhere . ... they thought i was a quite interesting creature .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- deep within the amazonian rainforest of ecuador live the huaorani . photographer trupal pandya traveled about 30 hours by air , water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits . the huaorani , which means `` the people '' or `` human beings , '' are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years . until about the 1960s , they never had any contact with the outside world . pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation , who travel to areas outside of their community , and the older generation , who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living . diverse changes have taken place within the community : the introduction of radios within many huaorani homes , the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of westernized clothing . for pandya , these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the huaorani . `` the biggest -lrb- reason -rrb- was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes , '' pandya said . `` i think if i would have -lrb- photographed the huaorani -rrb- 10 years back down the line or a little later than that , i do n't think i would have got what i just got . '' another aspect of modernization has to do with language . many huaorani , who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect , now speak the ecuadorian native language of spanish . pandya speaks english , so he needed translators to interact effectively . but it is apparent from his experiences with the huaorani that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words , but be more effectual than words when attempting to convey one 's intentions . `` i never started photographing when i -lrb- first -rrb- saw -lrb- the huaorani -rrb- , '' he said . `` i did n't even have my camera . i waited to let them get used to me around them . i gave myself time to get a little easier around them . even if you can not talk in the same language , i feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being . '' social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting , pandya took polaroid photos of the huaorani that they were then able to keep . `` i think some of them saw the polaroid for the first time , so they were really happy to see themselves like that , '' pandya said . for his formal portraits , pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the huaorani in a very direct and concise manner , eliminating the presence of any distractions . `` the main reason was to have the focus only on the people and their clothes and nothing else but them as an individual , them as a human being , '' he said . pandya 's decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment . creating portraits of the huaorani has been a `` fascinating , challenging '' experience for pandya , who is studying photography in new york at the fashion institute of technology . after witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the huaorani live in harmony with their environment , pandya said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life . `` i think the question i ask myself is : ` who 's richer ? ' '' he said . '' -lrb- this has been -rrb- a really big learning curve of how to just live a very beautiful , normal life .

hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- the search is on for china 's teen top guns . china said monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country 's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits . the schools , in 11 provinces across the country , will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16 , the china daily reported . successful applicants will receive flight training and `` military standard '' physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies . it 's the latest attempt by the people 's liberation army 's air force to attract more talent . last year , it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test . china 's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what president xi jinping has called `` balanced strength . '' `` china has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft , but it must make sure there can be sufficient , well-trained pilots to fly them , '' wang ya ` nan , deputy editor-in-chief of aerospace knowledge magazine told the china daily last month . the recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools . traditionally , serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in china and a u.s. report on china 's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge . many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education , while country 's one-child policy , which has created the `` little emperor '' phenomenon of spoiled children , produces recruits who `` may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline , '' the report added . to this end , china has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it modernizes its armed forces . on completing the three-year program , students will take a pilot selection test , and those who pass will join a pla flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it should n't come as a surprise that yemen has collapsed -- again . a country that has split and been pulled together before , has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region , is running low on oil and water , and possesses a `` personalist '' government rather than stable institutions , was on the top of every expert 's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next . what is surprising is that u.s. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone-bombing al qaeda terrorists could keep yemen intact and stable . indeed , last fall , when president barack obama pointed to u.s. policy in yemen as an example of a `` success '' and a model for the plans that would roll back the islamic state -lrb- also known as isis -rrb- , i shivered . for as september ended , shi'ite houthi rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city , sanaa . by january , the islamic state was noticeably increasing its recruitment in yemen , and that same month the yemen-based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly charlie hebdo attacks in paris . last week , the islamic state bombed two shi'ite mosques in yemen , killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer . this week , the houthi forces are closing in on yemen 's second major city , aden , on the south coast , and the u.s.-supported president , abdu rabbu mansour hadi , has reportedly fled the country . as the united states has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops , yemen has slid into total chaos , with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons . the situation is so dire that a coalition of sunni nations , led by saudi arabia , has launched massive airstrikes against the houthis , with a saudi adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into yemen to restore the hadi regime . yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability . these include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans ; a united elite ; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth . rather than working to secure these things , the u.s. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove `` dangerous elements '' will sustain broader social and political stability . anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in yemen and that aerial attacks on al qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them . those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner , while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast . what we have now is an area with about 24 million people , more than twice the population now under the rule of the islamic state in eastern syria and western iraq , that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all-out civil war between iran-supported shi'as and al qaeda/isis-aligned sunnis . it is a war that the west loses no matter who wins . it is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power , or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so . either task will be difficult , and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in syria and iraq . in other words , what has happened in yemen , although predictable , is about the worst outcome imaginable for u.s. policy . that america ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the middle east and north africa -- and the crisis of isis -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a delta airplane had a close call thursday , skidding off a snowy runway and stopping within feet of icy waters . any accident raises questions , and the national transportation safety board is sending people to new york 's laguardia airport to investigate . although the cause of the crash is not yet clear , officials will no doubt be looking at the conditions on the runway . was it cleared and ready ? did the pilot have all relevant information ? cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo breaks down the responsibilities around runways . `` there are a couple of things that airports have to do , '' she said . `` the airport has to go out and measure whether the airport runways have friction , meaning when those tires touch down that they will have some contact with the runway . '' that information is then relayed to the air traffic control tower , according to schiavo . `` as to whether the runways are slippery , that is breaking action , and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots , '' she said . port authority of new york and new jersey executive director patrick foye told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident . pilots on previous planes reported `` good braking action , '' he said . just minutes after the delta plane landed , all of laguardia arport shut down to air traffic . one runway reopened at 2 p.m. et . the other remained closed . miles o'brien , another cnn aviation analyst , highlights how difficult it is to understand all the elements in play . `` the wind was changing . the temperatures were changing . it was moving from rain to freezing rain , ultimately into snow . so you had a very dynamic weather picture , and let 's not forget , it 's kind of a subjective thing , '' he said . `` one pilot might say , ` oh that was no problem , ' but he might have learned how to fly in northern canada .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton worked hard last week to put the `` dead end '' sign on the state department email story by announcing there was nothing to find . but in her rush to control the narrative , clinton may have -lrb- once again -rrb- missed the bigger picture : in politics as much as in business , authenticity matters . her press conference had the familiar ring of a controlled performance -- the carefully parsed explanation , the combative posture -- that stretched our belief that what she 's telling us is really the whole story . people wonder : is she playing it straight with us ? why the nagging suspicion that brand hillary does not include bringing to the public table who she really is ? as the author joe mcginniss reported in his classic book on the 1968 nixon campaign , `` the selling of a president , '' political consultants long ago began marketing candidates like bars of soap . the practice has accelerated since the '60s as campaigns have concluded that political brands face the same tests among voters that consumer brands do among customers . and among consumers today , authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands . the desire for authenticity is a tangible driver of revenue for brands . increasingly , people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into . as author james h. gilmore told the new york times , a sense of authenticity reinforces trust in what is real `` in an increasingly staged , contrived and mediated world . '' a recent global study found that 63 % of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors , and more than 60 % would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic . ignoring the importance of authenticity to voters is a significant risk , as both mitt romney and al gore learned too late . and they were running in a perceptual environment more forgiving than today 's . voters easily identified the space between who these candidates really were and how they wanted us to perceive them . romney , the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician , struggled to seem ordinary and `` severely conservative , '' while gore was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the internet stuck to him like mud , even though he 'd never said it . the two shared what will likely also be clinton 's destiny : winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives . for clinton , an uncontested rise to the democratic nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she does n't have a problem with authenticity . she does , especially among independents and republicans . to be fair , clinton 's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the white house makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups . a recent gallup poll shows `` first female '' status as the `` best thing about a hillary clinton presidency , '' leading the positives mentioned by 30 % of democrats and 17 % of independents . but the next-closest best thing about clinton is a long way off : her experience is mentioned by only 16 % of democrats and 8 % of independents . a fledgling campaign apparatus , with powerful political recruits like john podesta and robby mook and marquee brand wizards from coca-cola and microsoft , might want to be looking hard at the dangerously lukewarm voter sentiment about experience and suitability that is lingering just beneath the surface of the `` first female president '' juggernaut . part of the heightened danger coming out of her press conference lies among millennials , who will be a critical voting group for democrats in the 2016 presidential election . and authenticity is of paramount importance to millennials in how they relate to everything in their lives , including politicians . as one commenter on a mediapost article on millennials put it , `` if brands ca n't be authentic millennials will call them on it . want to win our hearts ? a little self-deprecation and humility never hurt . '' forty percent of millennials in the u.s. admit to full-blown cynicism about the way they are approached by brands of all kinds . according to the mediapost article , authenticity and the allied trait of trustworthiness are two of the top brand attributes millennials look for before they make a decision to hand over their money and , one could argue by extension , their vote . these days , too , it 's trickier than ever for brands to stay in step with the conversations that move people to make judgments . whether they 're consumers or voters , people are more in tune with each other than at any other time in human history . they can gang up more easily to support or reject a person , an idea , and , yes , a company , brand or politician . brands are left on the outside looking in , puzzling out how to insert themselves into a meaningful relationship with constituents who can turn on them at any second . this trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in , and rewarding brands for it , has been accelerating with consumers across the u.s. over the course of the very same seven years since clinton last ran for president . since consumers are also voters , it stands to reason that any political brand -- including hillary clinton -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's called the grand renaissance dam -- and the clue is in the name . with some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction , the imposingly-named dam is surely one of africa 's most ambitious infrastructure projects , reaffirming ethiopia 's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power . when completed , the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports . the most striking aspect of the nearly $ 5 billion enterprise is , however , that it is entirely funded by ethiopia , without any foreign investment . according to the authorities , 20 % of the project is financed from bond offerings to ethiopians , and the remaining 80 % from tax collection . `` it was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the ethiopian people are financing it 100 % , '' says zemedeneh negatu , managing partner at ernst & young ethiopia . `` they have come up with a very creative and innovative way that i think will be a lesson for other african countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects , and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves , '' he adds . hydroelectric powerhouse . so far , ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $ 350 million , and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening , with 40 % of the work already complete . ethiopia 's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world , but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000 , averaging 10.9 % annually , which has resulted in a 33 % reduction of people living in poverty . if the grand renaissance dam and other hydroelectric projects , such as the gibe iii dam on the omo river , are completed on time , the world bank estimates ethiopia could earn $ 1 billion a year from electricity exports . negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in africa , and second only to south africa when it comes to installed capacity . unhappy neighbors . yet , not everyone is happy about ethiopia 's energetic drive to harness its water resources . the grand renaissance dam is being built on blue nile , a tributary of the nile river which has been powering the agriculture of sudan and egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia . these countries have opposed the project in the past , fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the nile water . the ousted egyptian president mohamed morsi had even threatened to defend `` each drop of nile water with our blood if necessary '' back in 2013 . passions have been calmer more recently , and today the reuters news agency reported that representatives of egypt , sudan and ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement in khartoum on how to operate the dam . negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached , as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just ethiopia but most other east african nations . `` this is actually a regional project because up from egypt all the way down to rwanda , countries are going to buy the power that 's generated by this dam , '' negatu says , adding that both rwanda and kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished . a lack of reliable power has long stunted africa 's development , with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators , kerosene lamps and candles . in ethiopia , only 15 to 20 % of the population has access to power according to a study by chatham house . `` it 's africa 's achilles ' heel , '' says negatu . `` with anyone who wants to build a factory in africa , the first thing they ask is infrastructure , and within infrastructure , whether there is sufficient electricity . industrialization has always been about electricity , and this -lsb- dam -rsb- addresses this basic need . '' he adds that , after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades , governments across africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization , following the example of china . `` we 've got to move up the value chain , and it 's what ethiopia is doing right now . its strategy is industrial-based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value-added things , and other african nations are trying to emulate that . but without electricity there wo n't be industrialization in africa .

fall river , massachusetts -lrb- cnn -rrb- shayanna jenkins , the fiancee of former new england patriots star aaron hernandez , revealed for the first time monday she suspects marijuana was in a box she was instructed to remove from the couple 's home the day after the slaying of odin lloyd in 2013 . hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of lloyd , the boyfriend of shayanna jenkins ' sister and semipro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013 . hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge . his co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . for the first time , shayanna jenkins told jurors on monday the box smelled `` skunky , '' making her think it was marijuana . her new description came during cross-examination . earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n't know what was in the box , said hernandez never told her , nor did she look . jenkins testified friday that on the day after lloyd 's slaying , her fiance called her with instructions that it was important to discard the box . on monday , she described his tone as `` normal '' when he made the request and said she had never been asked by prosecutors what she thought the box smelled like . `` were you ever asked what you thought was in the box ? '' asked hernandez lawyer charles rankin about her previous testimony to the grand jury . `` never , '' said jenkins . `` were you ever asked if it had any smell to it ? '' he asked . `` never , '' she replied . jenkins ' revelation contradicts the prosecution 's previous suspicion that the weapon used in the slaying was in the box . no weapon in the case has been recovered . home surveillance video played inside the courtroom monday showed shayanna jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister 's car . at the time , shaneah jenkins had been at her home grieving over the death of her boyfriend . shaneah jenkins was present in court on monday and cried while listening to the testimony and watching the video of her sister shayanna carrying the trash bag . the two sisters now barely speak to each other . shaneah jenkins sits next to lloyd 's mother in the courtroom on the opposite side of hernandez 's defense team . after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , shayanna jenkins said she disposed of it at a location she can not remember . `` i found a random dumpster , and put it in there , '' she told bristol county district attorney william mccauley . when questioned about her inability to remember the dumpster 's location and other details , shayanna jenkins said she had been unsettled at the time . `` i was nervous . i had to comfort my sister . everyone 's emotions were on me , and it was a form of breaking down at that point , '' she said . on monday , shayanna jenkins was asked about what she called an `` on-again , off-again '' relationship with hernandez , her high school sweetheart . she recalled spending time apart from hernandez after discovering evidence of infidelity on hernandez 's phone . she told the court that before getting back together with him , she had to make a difficult choice about her future with the football star . `` i made a decision that if i was going to move back in with aaron , i would need to compromise with his behavior , including his infidelity , '' she told the courtroom and then started to cry . after hernandez proposed in october 2012 , jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity . jenkins admitted giving some different answers during her grand jury testimony , in part , she said because of confusing questions by prosecutors . she faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges . jenkins has pleaded not guilty . this week , the jury is expected to hear from alexander bradley , hernandez 's former right hand man , who has accused hernandez of shooting him in the face in february of 2013 . however , a judge has barred him from discussing that . bradley is jailed in an unrelated shooting . the trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. tuesday . susan candiotti and lawrence crook reported from fall river , massachusetts . cnn 's karen smith wrote from atlanta .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- this is what it 's come to . starbucks asked its local baristas to have conversations about race . not the federal government or congress . not academia or the naacp . but a national coffee shop chain waded into an area of social conflict that is as old as the slave ships and as modern as stop-and-frisk policing . then people went crazy . starbucks ceo howard schultz was accused of ruining that magic morning moment when customers fork over $ 4.15 for a `` grande '' coffee with warm skim milk and vanilla extract . a barista writing `` race together '' on cups was called an affront to mornings and coffee -- such important conversations belonged inside a hallowed institution , not a common coffee shop , where apparently people no longer chat . a lot of the reaction came via snipes on twitter from people calling schultz out on starbucks ' diversity , the hue of his mochaccinos , or his liberal `` brewing '' of controversy . the nastiness drove the company 's communications chief briefly off twitter . then , after barely a week , starbucks shut down the whole darned thing , pushing ahead with a hiring and media initiative instead . but treating twitter as an important voice of american conscience is like focusing on the annoying beep emitting from your smoke detector instead of addressing the fact that the battery 's run dry . what 's trending is not necessarily what matters . people do need to talk about race . not because of a harmless coffee cup , but because we have a real race problem and we need solutions . starfish media group just finished a nationwide tour of american colleges , universities and communities called `` black in america 2015 . '' it 's based on our cnn documentary series that takes a close look at the challenges and triumphs of being black in america : from the hopes of the martin luther king era to today 's unlikely brew of un-kept promises and vast opportunities . there were plenty of conversations about race among the thousands of black and white college students and panelists like rapper chuck d and cedric alexander of the national organization of black law enforcement executives . they lined up to talk about how their experiences mirrored those of the people in the documentaries : black families finding common roots with whites , the politics of skin color , or the black-and-blue conflict over the police engaging in racial profiling . the topics and perceptions were an unending thread . not only did people talk when they were offered the chance ; they wanted to talk . at stony brook university , one of our tour stops , a young white male student asked our panel if effecting change in racial discrimination today was even harder to achieve than it was during the civil rights era when racism was more overt . what a good question . there are no longer signs segregating our bathrooms and water fountains , but police are being caught on cell phone videos in apparent attacks on young black men -- the new signposts of racial inequality . new technology has multiplied and spread symbols of racial injustice , but that has created new challenges and new reasons to talk . in this country we sometimes pretend we are so far past the ugly days of jim crow and middle-of-the-night cross burnings as to have no racial issues to discuss . we did , after all , elect a black president who , like me , has both a black and a white parent and descends from immigrants . but blacks and whites do n't see things the same , and that is a big problem we need to discuss . pew research center asked people of both races this year how much more needs to be done to achieve racial equality . seventy-nine percent of blacks said `` a lot '' more work needs to be done . just 44 % of whites thought the same . our country is more diverse than ever -- 13 % african-american and 17 % latino , according to the u.s. census -- but we still live in different worlds . blacks have more debt , higher unemployment , less financial security , are less likely to be married or own homes , and are less likely to be represented in corporate boardrooms , the tech industry or even congress . perhaps more alarmingly , 75 % of black students are going to schools where the majority of the students look just like them . it has been 60 years since brown v. board of education was supposed to bring our schoolchildren together on an equal playing field . that is something worth talking about . recently , bryan stevenson , who founded the equal justice initiative in montgomery , alabama , examined the details behind 3,959 lynchings in 12 southern states from 1877 to 1950 . he wants to raise money to memorialize the sites . we may not live in that land any more , though the fbi is investigating the death of a black man found hanging among the walnut trees this month in mississippi . but we do live in a land where there is a modern terror digging roots in the minds of young black men . in 2014 , our cnn documentary `` black in america : black & blue '' showed police officers talking fearfully about facing off against young criminals on familiar streets and african-american men in fear that they would become the victims of police shootings . the documentary was released just as grand juries chose not to indict the police officers in the eric garner and ferguson , missouri , cases . to me , it reveals how damaging the rift in our perceptions can be . a young man named keeshan harley talked about being frisked over 100 times . why ? `` because i fit the description , '' said the black college student . seventy percent of blacks believe , just like keeshan , that the police treat racial and ethnic groups differently and do not hold police officers accountable for misconduct , according to a study by the pew research center . the percentage of whites who agree with that perception hovers in the mid-30s . much of the white community does n't perceive or understand the persecution of a keeshan harley . but when they see a videotape , as in the eric garner case , many finally recognize there is a problem . we need to consider how a lack of confidence in government and law enforcement is dangerous in a civil society . a young man named luis paulino shared a cell phone video with me when i was reporting `` black & blue . '' it shows tall white police officers beating luis on the street for no apparent reason . he could n't call the police for help . these were the police . what if there had been no tape , i asked him . `` nobody would have believed me , '' he said . `` it would have been my word against 15 police officers . '' that is modern-day terror , and worth at least a coffee shop chat . black people talk about race all the time , from processing comments about our freckles to recounting how someone rolls their fingers through our child 's curly hair . we do n't get or expect an even playing field at work . we do n't ever get to cross a street in a hoodie at night without the other pedestrians making a string of assumptions . we do n't have some mutable characteristic . we wake up and go to bed black , and that makes a difference in this country . ceo howard schultz was left wondering why it was such a bad idea to encourage people to talk about race . his initial letter to his staff made it clear he believes his #racetogether coffee cup campaign can contribute to starting an important conversation . `` what if our customers ... had a renewed level of understanding and sensitivity about the issue , and they themselves would spread that to their own sphere of influence ? '' what a good question it was . what if ?

-lrb- cnn -rrb- there are two main ways visitors to ho chi minh city cross the streets . one approach is to step with zen-like calm into the swirl of honking scooters and serenely stride across the road without breaking step . like locals , they 're part of the flow , part of the -lrb- exhaust-choked -rrb- stream of traffic . the other is to stand anxiously on the edge of the curb , toes curled like a diver 's , waiting for a non-existent stoplight , then plunge into the melee while letting out a small yelp before slaloming across the street like a demented frogger . some , like steve mueller , would question why cross the road at all . if you ca n't beat them , join them . which is what the south carolinian did -- he now runs the city 's vietnam vespa adventures . it 's a tour company that provides two-wheel thrills on the italian vintage scooters , vespa , around ho chi minh city , out into the mekong delta and beyond . being on a scooter in ho chi minh is the best way to feel a part of the city , says mueller . `` it 's really an authentic experience , '' he says . `` being side by side with the locals . '' day tours take in popular sights like the opera house and central post office designed by gustav eiffel , but also stop at local eateries and offbeat locations . one popular early morning pit stop is tao dan park where ho chi minh city 's bird fanciers puff themselves up like their caged pets in a display of tweeting one-upmanship . unfortunately/thankfully , you 're not the one driving . all the mopeds are driven by local , experienced drivers who have no problem with the swarm of vehicles on the roads . a local tour guide rides along , too , to add context to the sights , smells and sounds experienced from the back of a two-stroke motor . mueller took a circuitous route to setting up the company . after traveling around southeast asia in 1997 he settled in vietnam the following year and discovered a glut of classic italian scooters that needed a bit of tlc . he bought his first one after just three days in the country and spying an opportunity to tap into international vespa enthusiasts ' desire for authentic rides , set up a restoration and export business . it became so successful he was in danger of putting himself out of a job , so in 2006 he decided to start a tour company offering multi-day tours outside of ho chi minh city . according to mueller , his business was kick-started by vietnam 's appearance on the tv program `` top gear , '' which showed the country 's beautiful countryside and underused roads . longer trips are still offered by vespa tours , taking willing riders as far as the vietnam highlands and the coastal city of nha trang over seven days . most of the scooters in mueller 's garage hark back to the golden age of vespas , the late '60s and 1970s , refurbished with replacement parts from piaggio-licensed machinists in india . true to their reputation , the 100 or so classic scooters owned by vespa adventures break down frequently -- mechanics are on hand for running repairs -- but mueller believes its all part of the charm in a city where two wheels beats two legs . vietnam vespa adventures , 169a de tham , district 1 , ho chi minh city , vietnam ; +84 12 2299 3585 / +84 9 3850 0997 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- americans like to complain about the endless political gridlock in our capital . but if we 're honest we need to look in the mirror too . many of us abandoned the field by not voting in last year 's midterm elections . those of us who did vote elected more fire breathers than bridge builders to congress . what 's more , when we 're invited to tell our representatives what we want , we can be as demagogic as they are . remember the town hall meetings in the summer of 2009 , which erupted in shouting matches between citizens and legislators over health care ? who can forget the massachusetts woman holding a picture of president obama defaced to look like hitler , who demanded to know why former rep. barney frank supported the `` nazi policy '' of extending health care to all ? his frank response : `` ma'am , trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table . i have no interest in doing it . '' rather than blame our leaders for the dysfunction , we need to change the game . we can turn to public forums to tackle big issues of the day . consider two efforts to move beyond the contentious debate about climate change . in washington , the senate made a splash by voting for the first time to acknowledge that global warming is really happening . unfortunately , senators could n't agree on whether humans are changing the climate and what to do about it . stalemate . outside of the beltway , in southeast florida , it 's been five years since the region adopted a comprehensive climate action plan with 110 steps aimed at mitigating its dangers and reducing the region 's carbon emissions . as research by dan kahan of yale law school shows , these counties took action not because floridians are less divided over political issues , or less partisan , or more scientifically literate than the rest of america . no one sang kumbaya or hugged a polar bear . instead , florida officials engaged their constituents through scores of open forums convened by governments , businesses and community groups . local leaders appealed across party lines by framing the issue as one of protecting residents from rising sea levels and storm surges , rather than as a divisive referendum on whether to believe in climate science . rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign , officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support . `` we recognize each other 's differences , '' explained susanne torriente , fort lauderdale 's assistant city manager , `` but also recognize that if we work together we can make south florida more resilient . '' given what florida accomplished , gov. rick scott 's ban on using the terms `` climate change '' in state policy discussions to avoid polarization looks smart , not smarmy . florida is not alone . our research identifies many successful examples of political deliberation in well-designed forums where citizens and officials engage in give-and-take discussion and arrive at solutions . these forums have developed `` participatory budgets '' in many cities , energy policy in texas and nebraska , community policing in chicago and much more . some of these forums are healing the rotting roots of democracy . for example , gerrymandering of political districts has become one way to protect the party in power and create safe seats for incumbents , sapping their incentive to represent constituents from the opposing party or craft bipartisan legislation . as a north carolina state senator once said , `` we are in the business of rigging elections . '' in response in 2010 californians used their power to approve ballot initiatives to create a nonpartisan citizens redistricting commission , which redrew political districts that better reflected the state 's communities and helped elect a legislature that could work together more productively . this is one reason why the state 's budgeting process , once an endless game of chicken that paralyzed public services and rang up huge deficits , has become less rancorous and more fiscally responsible . let 's hope the supreme court does n't kill this reform . but not every ballot initiative is as enlightened . many are highly technical proposals pushed by special interests , and multiple initiatives can overwhelm the public 's ability to evaluate them all . oregon 's legislature responded by creating a citizens initiative review board , which researches proposed ballot measures , deliberates about their pros and cons , and makes recommendations on how fellow citizens should vote . many oregonians rely on the board 's recommendations , which are published in the state 's voter guide and mailed to every household . unlike politics as usual -lrb- and those infamous town hall meetings -rrb- , these forums put citizens at the center of decision-making . citizens are challenged to deliberate with each other and forge agreements , with officials and experts joining the effort by giving testimony and feedback . moderators challenge people to treat other respectfully and consider a wide range of arguments and evidence , rather than engaging in hand-to-hand political combat . grandstanding and obstructionism do n't play as well in these forums as they do on the senate floor , partisan media outlets or the local tavern . it 's still politics , but it 's a politics that offers better odds of success by engaging both citizens and officials productively . the people who participate , many of whom regard typical public meetings like ebola , say they actually enjoy talking politics with other citizens and officials , sometimes for the first time in their lives . can you imagine that ? while there are experts who know how to design good forums , it 's no easy task . as the health care town hall meetings showed , simply throwing open the doors is not sufficient . most people do n't have the time to attend a forum , so they need to know whether people like them deliberated and the rules of engagement were fair . it 's important to ensure that citizens can participate on equal terms . if we want to move beyond political stalemate , we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials . when these forums work , they put citizens and leaders on the same side of the chessboard .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for four years , william bruce james ii called the university of oklahoma 's sigma alpha epsilon his home . he walked its halls , bunked in its rooms , held office as one of its leaders , considered his fraternity brothers his dearest friends . he was proud to be sae . now that pride is tainted . a video shot this saturday of party-bound shows sae members clapping , pumping their fists and chanting in unison : `` there will never be a ni **** sae , '' they sing . `` you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . '' these young men are talking about him , james said . that 's because not only is he an sae alumni , he is also african-american . how do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins , occupied the same house , preached `` the same motto that i hold dear to my heart '' as james did ? `` i could n't look at myself , '' he said , `` still claiming to be that . '' since the video surfaced sunday , students have been expelled and sae 's oklahoma chapter has shut down . the episode has left james disgusted , horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred . students expelled over racist chant . `` i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , '' he told cnn on tuesday . `` that is not my home . that is not sae . they are not my brothers . '' while the oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members , that did n't matter to james when he joined in 2001 . sae was where he forged lifelong friendships , where he and others grew into men . `` we were becoming something while i was there , '' he said . `` something that i do n't think these kids grasped . ... i do n't think they know what it means to be a brother of any fraternity , let alone mine . '' james does n't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident , not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically . nor does he think that only those leading the chant deserve punishment . just as easily as one person could have started it , someone else could have called for it to stop . that 's what james thinks that his own fraternity brothers would 've done , whether he was around or not . they understood the importance of stepping up to say : `` this is n't right , this is n't what i stand for , this is n't gentlemanly , this is n't even human , '' he said . `` that 's what being an sae is .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- after enduring about four days at sea under stressful conditions , tyke , an african elephant , escaped during a circus performance , crushing her trainer to death and injuring dozens of others while storming through the streets of honolulu . tyke suffered a slow and painful death after being hit by a barrage of bullets fired by police officers . that incident happened 20 years ago , but the welcome announcement last week by feld entertainment -- parent company to ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus -- that it plans to retire elephants from its circuses by 2018 is a reminder of how that controversy lingers . in analyzing the horrific experience involving tyke , it was reported that the elephant had been rebellious before she arrived on our shores , and she is said to have had a history of acting out and being unpredictable . and though she was not submissive and was difficult to train , her owners sent her to honolulu anyway . sadly , performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions , especially in their training . reward-based training takes time and patience , which are things that many circus trainers do not have . instead , these trainers frequently resort to other inhumane means , involving beating the animals , using electrical prods , depriving them of food , chaining them and other brutal methods to force the animals into submission . following this sort of brutal training , the animals may appear tame , but they are still wild and their original wild instincts will appear if provoked . meanwhile , animals that are no longer useful to the circus or traveling shows due to age or temperament may be given away or sold to other less reputable organizations . they lack proper veterinary care , and what little quality of life they did have is diminished further . the welfare of the animal is not taken into account . rather than being treated as a commodity by the owner , animals should be protected and well cared for . ringling bros. and barnum & bailey has said it prides itself on providing a healthy environment for animals . yet whatever provisions they may make , the reality is that circuses are particularly unsuited to meet the unique needs of elephants . these extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild , and they form close social ties with other elephants . but the circus environment keeps them isolated and provides little to no interaction with their own species . their herd-like behavior is ignored when they are being trained to perform . these very social animals , simply put , should not be living in solitary confinement . animal welfare advocates have often been criticized as being against `` fun . '' we are told that circuses and traveling shows are about education . but what could one possibly learn about animals from watching these shows ? observing wild animals perform unnatural tricks while dancing in tutus only teaches the public that the sole purpose of animals is our entertainment . are these really the values we want our children to learn ? wildlife sanctuaries and accredited zoos should exist for conservation , preservation and propagation of species and for public education . this is where learning should occur . wild animals should be permitted to exist undisturbed in their natural environments , and when they must be confined , it should be in a natural setting consistent with their physical and behavioral needs . this is the proper setting for education and study . ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus has come a long way in its thinking , and for that we congratulate the company for its decision to move the elephants to its sanctuary in florida . rather than fighting the many cities and counties that have taken steps to pass anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances , the company instead is putting its resources toward the study and protection of elephants . with this step , we look forward to the day that it , and other circuses , phase out all wild animals , including the lions and tigers that also are featured in their shows . after all , wild and exotic animals are not meant to entertain us . the hawaiian humane society feels strongly about the humane treatment of all animals , whether domesticated or wild . our organization , like others in the animal welfare movement , seeks to prevent any practice that might produce pain , stress , injury or suffering to any animal . this is an important part of creating a more humane society -- for people and all animals .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- while boston and other new england cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons , other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions . all that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year . march is typically a transitional month , where warm moist air from the gulf of mexico collides with cold arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes . this year , however , the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the east remains stuck in more of a winter mode . `` we 're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather , and the right ingredients -- moisture , instability and lift -- -lrb- have yet to come together -rrb- , '' said greg carbin , the warning coordination meteorologist with the storm prediction center in norman , oklahoma . the group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather . so far this year it 's been extremely quiet . by this time in mid-march the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide . this year they have issued a paltry four . both january and february were well below normal . march has been even quieter . at a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably , there has not been a single report this month of a tornado . `` we are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather '' carbin said . in fact if we make it through the entire month of march without any tornado reports it would be a first , according to the center . there have been around 20 tornadoes reported since january 1 , well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-march . this year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the united states the past several years . in 2014 , we ended the year with a count of 881 , well below the average of 1,253 . meteorologists do n't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes , but one possible answer is the development of el nino , a warming in the equatorial pacific , which can influence weather patterns globally . recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the united states during these events . the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently said that a weak el nino had developed . so while all agree this is good news so far this year , it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet . weather patterns can change quickly . in 1984 , for instance , there was a very similar slow start through mid-march and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of june , according to data from the storm center . it 's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low , you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example . the year ended being roughly 30 % below normal for the number of tornadoes , yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record . the twisters in moore and el reno , oklahoma , occurred in may of that year with devastating results . tornadoes fast facts .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- after weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts , `` fashion police '' is going on an extended break . the fashion commentary show on e! channel announced tuesday that it will be on hiatus until september . `` we look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season , '' it said in a statement . the announcement caps a rocky few months . last week , co-host kathy griffin bid the show bye-bye after seven episodes , saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts . she made a dig at the show on her way out . `` there is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people 's bodies into it , '' she said in a statement . `` i do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference . '' shortly before her departure , co-host giuliana rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that disney star zendaya coleman 's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana . rancic later issued an on-air apology to the 18-year-old after social media jumped to the teen 's defense . but her apology was not enough for co-host kelly osbourne , who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later . rancic and fellow co-host brad goreski will return in september , along with executive producer melissa rivers .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the 1-0 scoreline that took barcelona through to the champions league quarterfinals made their clash with manchester city all seem rather academic . yet it was anything but as lionel messi 's masterful first-half display had some purring once again about his status as the greatest footballer of all time . meanwhile , the second half witnessed another masterclass as england international joe hart somehow kept city in a lively encounter with save after save . in between , the man that city usually rely on to dig them out of tight spots -- sergio aguero -- failed to score a late penalty that could have set up a tense finish . in truth , the english champions deserved little over the two legs as barcelona built upon their 2-1 victory in manchester three weeks ago to go through as 3-1 aggregate winners . the four-time champions may not have added the goals they deserved but they did reach the last eight for the eighth year in a row , a competition record . `` it was a game with a lot of chances where we could have finished it off a lot earlier , '' barca coach luis enrique told reporters . `` we got what we wanted which was to go through to the next round and i am happy with the display . we played well and this is a big boost for us at this stage of the season . '' the high-profile scrutiny of the relationship between coach enrique and argentine superstar lionel messi suddenly seems a distant memory with barca still capable of repeating their wonder year of 2009 . on that occasion , they won the champions league , la liga and spanish super cup under the guidance of pep guardiola , who was one of many enthralled spectators inside the camp nou . now in charge of fellow quarterfinalists bayern munich , guardiola was out of his seat -- seemingly in celebration -- as ivan rakitic opened the scoring after 31 minutes when lifting the ball over hart following a fine pass from messi . the diminutive argentine flashed two free-kicks from distance onto the top of the goal netting while also displaying an array of twists , turns and embarrassing ` nutmegs ' for his opponents . it was enough to make former england international gary lineker , the top scorer at the 1986 world cup , proclaim him the best footballer ever . while that engrossing debate rumbles on , messi set about trying to put the tie to bed but he met fierce resistance from hart , who had kept city in the tie in the first leg when saving the argentine 's injury-time penalty . england 's number one made 10 saves , the most of any keeper in any champions league this season , not only repelling messi but also neymar and suarez , both of whom were also denied by the post in the first half . to their credit , the premier league side -- who were looking to reach the champions league quarterfinals for the first time -- improved after the break but found chances hard to come by . that was until aguero won a penalty after going down under a challenge from first gerard pique , and then argentina colleague javier mascherano , with just over ten minutes left . but dutch keeper marc-andre ter stegen dived right -- in both senses -- to beat away the spotkick and ultimately seal city 's fate . barcelona can now prepare for sunday 's superclasico clash with real madrid , whom they lead in the la liga table by one point . `` we 've gone out to a magnificent side for the second time in two years , '' joe hart told sky sports television . `` they will get a lot of plaudits but we had a big chance with the penalty . '' questions will now be asked of coach manuel pellegrini , who had been expected to perform better in the champions league after roberto mancini twice failed to get out of the group stages . it means that for the second time in three years , no english team have made the last eight , where barca have joined madrid sides real and atletico , bayern munich , monaco , paris saint-germain , porto and juventus . the latter made it through after beating borussia dortmund 3-0 in germany to secure a convincing 5-1 aggregate victory . on a night when manchester city had failed to score , it was not lost on many that their former striker carlos tevez netted twice and made one , converted by alvaro morata , for the italians . `` it was a game to forget . it started badly and did not get any better , '' dortmund coach jurgen klopp , who led his side to the 2013 champions league final , told reporters . `` we deserved to be eliminated . '' the draw for the quarterfinals will be held on friday .

'' ross does n't begin by hammering them with questions . he wants to have a conversation . `` i say , ` what 's gone on in your life ? ' '' the result of that tenderness and patience is ross ' latest collection of photos , `` girls in justice . '' the images are unflinching . they convey the ugliness of a young person 's life behind bars . the pictures are replete with the unique loneliness , anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center . but the girls also tell their stories alongside the images . one photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit , hand on her head , sitting alone in a drab , cavernous room . `` i 've been here 17 times , '' one girl says . many of the stories are bleak , reflecting adults who endangered the girls or , at the very least , failed repeatedly to protect them . `` mom 's a stripper . dad was an alcoholic , drug addict , murdered last year , '' said one girl explaining her past . `` they took my brother and i away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down . i lived with my grandma and uncle . the people who are supposed to love you never do . '' the photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks , staring at the wall . some struggle with mental illness . the girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera . that works to protect their identities , but it also evokes shame . ross seems to be saying the shame is n't the girls ' -- it 's ours as a society for jailing children . his images are n't always literal . a photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire . a straight-forward photo , of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors , turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . ross recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him , `` i ca n't wait to get out of here so i can kill myself . '' `` she was just a kid , but she was at that place where you have no hope , '' he said . `` i feel all these stories , but that one just hit me hard . i was sobbing . you want to say , ` it will get better , ' but you also know the system and you know that you ca n't say that . '' ross , the son of a new york city police officer , had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means . he got into a decent amount of trouble growing up , and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system . but times were different then , he said , and there 's been a cultural turn in america toward criminalizing a child 's bad behavior . he recalls a detention-center director in reno , nevada , who asked him to visit and take photos . at intake , he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class . `` this fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle , '' ross recalled . `` he was drinking warm milk , like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk . i can still smell that milk . that intake area smelled like elementary school . '' the child 's single mother could n't pick him up for hours . she was holding down a job that would n't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m. . the detention-center director sent ross ' photo to every principal in the area to make a point : children do not belong in lockup , so find another solution . ross is adamant that he 's making photographs to bring about `` immediate change . '' he speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates . his work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing . `` i 'm trying to wake people up , make them realize there are lives at stake , '' he said . `` at the same time , i do n't , i ca n't , position myself as the great hope . i might not be able to do much but listen . but i think i 'm a good listener , and i think these kids deserve to tell their stories .

'' kazushige todaka , the director of japan 's kure maritime museum , said last week after viewing the information posted by allen that it appeared that the vessel was the musashi , although pictures of the entire body of the ship were needed to know for sure . todaka said , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was `` 90 % sure '' that the ship was the musashi . `` i was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down , '' he said . `` i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true . '' todaka said allen 's team had been in contact with the museum about the expedition and the ship 's potential location . cnn 's yoko wakatsuki and brad lendon contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- well-off north koreans really love baguettes -- and the country is dispatching citizens outside its borders to learn how to make them , says a report by a pro-north korea newspaper based in japan . according to the choson sinbo , a north korean factory sent its staff abroad in an attempt to improve its food products -- which include baguettes and sweet potato cakes . no word yet on whether they 've succeeded . but it 's not the first time north korea has sent its citizens into the world to seeking culinary skills . last april , officials from the reclusive authoritarian state traveled to the national dairy industry college in franche-comte , eastern france , in an attempt to master the art of cheese making . but they were turned away at the door . `` there is no basis to go further with north korea because such a partnership does not fit into our priorities and strategy , '' its director veronique drouet told afp . north korea 's kumkop food plant is n't just focused on french food , though . in january , north korea 's central news agency -lrb- kcna -rrb- said kim jong un toured the factory and asked it to produce chewing gum . food security remains poor for most north koreans . the world food programme reported a `` severe '' food availability situation in the country last september , with rations dipping to their lowest level in three years .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- legendary fashion designers domenico dolce and stefano gabbana are in a public spat with pop music icon elton john over some eyebrow-raising comments the pair made about gay parenting . long against same-sex marriage , the italian designers -- who are not only openly gay , but were once a couple -- took their counterintuitive rhetoric to the next level this weekend when dolce said in an interview : . `` you are born to a mother and a father -- or at least that 's how it should be . i call children of chemistry , synthetic children . rented uterus , semen chosen from a catalog . '' john , who along with his husband david furnish is raising two children that were conceived through ivf , took to twitter to essentially say `` oh no he did n't , '' followed by '' #boycottdolcegabbana '' because nothing expresses anger quite like a hashtag . not to be outdone , the pair responded with #boycotteltonjohn . so what should we make of all this boycott talk ? combined , the three men are worth an estimated $ 3 billion . the openly gay ricky martin , who is raising two boys via a surrogate mother , sided with john -lrb- but he 's only worth an estimated $ 60 million , so i 'm not sure if anyone noticed -rrb- . regardless , while i find the archaic thinking of dolce and gabbana disappointing , the truth is my budget boycotted their clothing years ago . some of it 's really nice . but i just ca n't afford to spend $ 500 on a t-shirt . and even if i could , i do n't know how i would justify doing so with a kid to put through college . that 's why i find this whole ultra rich on ultra rich violence so disconnected from the reality most of us on twitter are living . boycott ? besides the 1 % , who the hell is buying dolce and gabbana regularly enough to actually call the act of not buying their clothing a `` boycott '' ? that 's a little like me saying i 'm upset with the way james dolan is running the new york knicks so i refuse to play for him . even misguided consumers wallowing in debt and living way above their means likely do not have enough credit cards to keep up with the purchasing power of the elton johns of this world . -lrb- no lie -- the online store has a pair of `` polka dot print slim fit denim jeans '' for $ 795 . and you still have to pay for shipping . and there 's also a cotton vest on sale for $ 795 . a cotton vest !! -rrb- . here 's an idea : considering it can cost about $ 20,000 for each attempt at ivf , and the procedure has roughly a 40 % success rate , i would say the vast majority of people who were the direct targets of dolce 's words are not using their expendable cash to buy their clothing anyway . if john , martin , courtney love and other ultra-rich celebrities really want to leverage their celebrity to ignite a movement we can buy into -lrb- pun intended -rrb- take that would-be dolce and gabanna money and start an endowment for those who ca n't afford ivf treatments . or consider `` modern family 's '' jesse tyler ferguson , who tweeted he wanted to unload his dolce and gabanna suits in a way that would help those who ca n't afford the ivf treatments . retweeting a hashtag is a great way to publicly shame . but crowdsourcing among the 1 % could make a difference in the lives of people who so desperately want to be parents that they mortgage their homes trying . it also creates a medium in which us regular folks can legitimately express our disappointment in the designers ' words and not take the convenient route via blogs and hashtag activism . and yes , i realize i 'm criticizing myself as well . but i have some self-awareness . when you tweet `` je suis d&g '' -- thus comparing your pr nightmare to the one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in recent europe history -- you do n't .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- an indiana jury sentenced a woman who says she had a miscarriage to 20 years in prison . in 2013 , purvi patel showed up at a hospital emergency room suffering from severe vaginal bleeding . according to court documents , at first she denied that she had been pregnant but later told doctors that she had a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn fetus which , she said , she placed in a bag in a dumpster . patel was later charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent , though these charges are decidedly contradictory . `` feticide '' would require patel to have terminated a pregnancy while the fetus was still in the womb . on the other hand , `` felony neglect of a dependent '' requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it . as amanda marcotte of slate pointed out in february , patel `` was convicted both of killing a baby and killing a fetus . '' the only thing more preposterous than this is that patel was charged in the first place . the evidence against her has been shaky from the start . initially , police questioned patel when she was still in the hospital without an attorney present . prosecutors would later introduce text messages indicating that patel had purchased miscarriage-inducing drugs , but there was no evidence patel took the drugs . in fact , they did n't show up in blood tests just after she miscarried . nonetheless , after five hours of deliberation , a jury convicted patel of two entirely contradictory crimes based on entirely circumstantial evidence . and on march 30 , 2015 , she was given a 30-year-sentence on the felony neglect charge , 10 of which were suspended . she 'll serve a concurrent six-year sentence for feticide . patel is the second pregnant woman to be charged under indiana 's anti-choice `` feticide '' law . in 2011 , bei bei shuai was charged with feticide after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant . in 2013 , lawyers announced shuai had reached a plea agreement just before her trial was set to begin . still , both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government . but indiana 's harsh anti-abortion laws , and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies , make women far less likely to reach out for this help . conservatives like to say that women are the `` victims of abortion '' and that laws such as the indiana `` feticide '' measure are intended to `` protect '' them . years ago , the president of the anti-choice susan b. anthony list made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists . the website of the ohio right to life association similarly argues that `` no one is interested in sending women to jail . '' and in fact , the indiana `` feticide '' law was plainly intended to criminalize `` knowing or intentional termination of another 's pregnancy . '' but there 's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals . so much for not sending women to jail . those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned . after all , patel was convicted based on text messages about miscarriage-inducing drugs , not evidence she had used or even purchased such drugs . in shuai 's case , it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with feticide . so what else might be considered a `` deliberate attempt '' to terminate one 's own pregnancy ? if a woman knew about the risks of too vigorous exercise and miscarriage but exercised anyway ? merely googling abortion-inducing drugs ? telling a friend you 've thought about having an abortion ? the message from purvi patel 's conviction is clear . after all , there have always been and will always be women who try to terminate their pregnancies . laws like indiana 's and cases like patel 's do n't change that . what they do is make women hide , avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk . in texas , which last year enacted some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the nation and shuttered the majority of its abortion services clinics , abortion rates have indeed declined but not in proportion to the severity of such measures . researchers suggest that 's partly because rates of self-abortion , which then go unreported in the statistics , are increasing . and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the case . before roe v. wade made abortion legal in the united states , according to the guttmacher institute , the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year . new anti-choice restrictions and prosecutions wo n't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies . it simply restricts their options to do so . ask yourself : in the case of purvi patel , even if she did intend to self-abort and used black market drugs to do so , and if she indeed delivered a live fetus , would n't we want to live in a society where she would bring that baby to the hospital for life-saving medical attention rather than be so afraid of prosecution that she threw it in a dumpster ? purvi patel is reportedly appealing her conviction . we should all appeal to logic and sanity and compassion and repeal these horrid anti-choice , anti-pregnancy laws .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- australian foreign minister julie bishop says the government is seeking to confirm reports that an australian teenager has carried out a suicide attack on behalf of isis in iraq . `` i can confirm that the australian government is currently seeking to independently verify reports that 18-year-old melbourne teenager jake bilardi has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in the middle east , '' she told reporters . `` if these reports are confirmed , this is another tragic example of a young australian being lured to a senseless and violent death by a brutal terrorist organization that is intent on imposing suffering and misery not only in iraq and syria but beyond . '' on wednesday , isis claimed that `` abu abdullah al-australi , '' along with four other foreign fighters , had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of ramadi in iraq . the claim , issued on a twitter account associated with the anbar provincial division of isis , was accompanied by a series of 20 images , including a photo of a young man who looked like bilardi . the image appeared to show bilardi at the wheel of a car with the caption , `` abu abdullah al-australi -lrb- may allah accept him -rrb- , the attacker on the 8th brigade . '' the other attackers hailed from belgium , syria , uzbekistan and the caucasus , the twitter account claimed . victoria police said bilardi first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year . a search of his family 's home in the melbourne suburb of craigieburn following his disappearance uncovered chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device , police said , although no actual bombs were found . bishop said bilardi 's passport had been canceled in october on the advice of australian security agencies . australian media have reported that bilardi kept a since-deleted blog , written under his alias abu abdullah al-australi . entitled `` from melbourne to ramadi : my journey , '' it reportedly detailed his transition from an `` atheist school student in affluent melbourne to a soldier of the khilafah preparing to sacrifice my life for islam . '' the blog reportedly described a plan to attack targets in melbourne , after an initial attempt to move to iraq or syria failed . `` this plan involved launching a string of bombings across melbourne , targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar , '' he wrote , according to the sydney morning herald . member of bilardi 's family have linked the teen 's radicalization to the loss of his mother from cancer . `` he 's just a young boy that went looking for something after he lost someone very very dear to him , his mother , '' his aunt , connie bilardi , told cnn affiliate seven on monday . a former classmate of bilardi 's from melbourne 's craigieburn secondary college described the teen on facebook as a `` shy kid who did n't like to be disturbed '' . `` one day , he randomly got angry at me and tried to punch me , '' he posted . `` always keep an eye out on the quiet ones . '' a former penpal of bilardi told cnn he cut off communication with the teenager about two years ago , when bilardi started posting islamic extremist messages on his facebook page . the friend , who requested not to be named , said he first met bilardi on the website interpals.net about seven years ago . they shared a love for soccer -- bilardi was a supporter of chelsea football club -- and became penpals . bilardi told him about his mother 's death , and confided that he was fighting with his family , because they would not allow him to go overseas to study . the penpal said he started noticing a change in bilardi 's behavior when the teen started posting `` things that supported osama bin laden '' on facebook . `` i got scared , '' the friend said . `` my friends here told me that maybe i should stop talking to him . '' he blocked bilardi on the social networking site about two years ago . after a while , he said , he got curious about how his old penpal was doing . `` i thought he was my friend . i wanted to make sure he was okay ... i sent him an email saying ` are you well ? ' but he never wrote back . '' bishop said that 90 australian citizens are in iraq and syria fighting on the side of isis , and that at least 20 australians have been killed in the conflict . the passports of some 100 australians had been canceled on national security grounds , she said . bishop appealed to young australians `` not to fall victim to this brutal terrorist organization , to not be lured into believing that they 're embarking on some adventure or some romantic endeavor . '' `` this is a brutal organization dedicated to creating misery and hardship , '' she said . `` its activities of beheadings and executions and crucifixions all take us back to the dark ages . '' australian prime minister tony abbott addressed bilardi 's alleged suicide attack in comments to the press thursday . this is a horrific situation -- an absolutely horrific situation -- and it shows the lure of this death cult to impressionable youngsters , '' he said . `` it 's very , very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking alien and extreme ideology .

atlanta -lrb- cnn -rrb- the daughter of the late singer whitney houston , in a medically induced coma after being found unresponsive in january , has been moved to a rehabilitation facility , a source close to the family said friday . bobbi kristina brown , 22 , had been treated at emory university hospital . no details about the transfer to a rehab facility were given . brown , houston 's daughter with singer bobby brown , was found unresponsive january 31 in a bathtub at her home in the atlanta suburb of roswell . the extent of her injuries is n't known . last month , doctors at emory removed her breathing tube , allowing brown to be ventilated through a hole in her throat . at the time , cnn chief medical correspondent sanjay gupta said the procedure suggested she would need to be on such support for `` weeks and months to come . '' police have said they are treating brown 's case as a criminal investigation . when houston died in 2012 , she was also found in a bathtub . a coroner ruled her death an accidental drowning , with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors . brown is houston 's only child . brown 's boyfriend , nick gordon , says he performed cpr after finding brown in the tub . gordon has complained that brown 's family has not allowed him to see her , but bobby brown said last month that gordon simply refused to abide by the family 's terms for a visit . cnn 's sunny hostin contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- gov. mike pence unleashed a firestorm on indiana last week when he signed the religious freedom restoration act . critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the lgbt community of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion . the ramifications for the hoosier state are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts , petitions and travel bans . as the controversy mushrooms , here 's what got us to where we are . and where things are headed . last week , pence put his signature on the rfra -- a law that allows indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense . the law states that the government ca n't `` substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion '' and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be `` substantially burdened '' can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits . in an opinion piece in the wall street journal , pence says the rfra `` ensures that indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people 's religious liberty . '' pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law . civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief . `` silence is consent ! '' tweets laurel davilia , a commentator on brass knuckles progressives radio . from sports teams to musicians to other cities and states , they fell like dominoes . the ncaa , which is headquartered in indianapolis and set to host its men 's basketball final four in the city this week , said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years . the nba , wnba and nfl issued critical statements too . indianapolis colts owner jim irsay says fans of all stripes are welcome . `` the colts have always embraced inclusiveness , tolerance , and a diverse fan base , '' irsay tweets . `` we welcome all fans to colts nation . one family ! '' a petition posted on change.org hopes to get the big ten conference to move its football championship out of indianapolis . `` i think that indiana needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex , age , religion , gender identity , or sexual orientation , '' sean burke of madison , wisconsin , says in the petition . `` as a football fan , i think we can send a message by calling on the ncaa and big ten conference to take a stand . '' lucas oil stadium in indianapolis is scheduled to host the league 's championship game through the 2021 season . at last check , the petition had more than 11,000 supporters . the mayors of san francisco and seattle have barred spending on travel to indiana . the governors of connecticut and washington state did the same thing . and you can add wilco to the boycott bandwagon . the group is canceling its may 7 show in indianapolis , it says on facebook . `` the ` indiana religious freedom restoration act ' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us , '' wilco says . `` hope to get back to the hoosier state someday soon , when this odious measure is repealed . '' cher is among the artists speaking out . her son chaz bono is a transgender man . '' #govpence is another example of right wing racism , asault on womans rights & hatred of lgbt americans , '' she tweets . indiana 's top two state lawmakers pledged monday to amend the state 's controversial `` religious freedom '' law to clarify that it can not be used to discriminate against gay people . `` this law does not discriminate , and it will not be allowed to do so , '' david long , the indiana senate president pro tem , said during a news conference with state house speaker brian bosma . pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law . critics still were n't on board with the anti-discrimination claims . opponents of rfra marched around the state capitol . someone even created a satire ad : `` indiana . it 's a great place to be a bigot . '' . the rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in tuesday 's edition of the indianapolis star blares the headline : `` fix . this . now . '' the editorial suggests the rfra and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist . the state is at a crossroads it says . '' -lrb- n -rrb- o matter its original intent -lrb- the law -rrb- already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future , '' according to the editorial . `` only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage . '' the editorial closes with : . `` governor , indiana is in a state of crisis . it is worse than you seem to understand . `` you must act with courage and wisdom . you must lead us forward now . you must ensure that all hoosiers have strong protections against discrimination . `` the laws can co-exist . and so can we . '' some of the gop 's top figures are backing pence despite the controversy . jeb bush and marco rubio have voiced their support . both are considered likely republican candidates for the white house . sen. ted cruz , who announced his candidacy last week , is also on board . `` i 'm proud to stand with gov. @mike_pence for religious liberty , and i urge americans to do the same , '' cruz tweets . indiana is the 20th state to adopt a `` religious freedom restoration '' law , most of which are modeled after the religious freedom restoration act , which president bill clinton signed into law in 1993 . but that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and was n't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years . adam talbot , a spokesman with the human rights campaign , a gay rights group , stresses that those 20 laws are `` dramatically different in their scope and effect . '' `` calling them similar in this way risks being misleading . indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country , '' talbot says . arkansas ' legislature passed an indiana-style law on friday , which now heads to the state 's governor for approval . despite the controversy , the indiana governor says concerns that his state 's new `` religious freedom '' law will allow businesses to turn away lgbt customers is the result of a `` tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding . '' still , he was hard pressed to explain why that was n't the case . given a chance on sunday to add some clarity , pence refused to answer at least six yes-or-no questions from abc 's george stephanopoulos about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians . jeremy diamond and eric bradner contributed to this report .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a florida `` dream ticket , '' two nuggets about leadership questions in congress and coming tests for sen. ted cruz and ohio gov. john kasich filled our final march trip around the `` inside politics '' table . 1 . another `` draft warren '' movement ? if you follow politics , you have heard this one : liberals say elizabeth warren has to run for president because hillary clinton is too cozy with wall street . and now that senate minority leader harry reid is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top senate democratic job -- you are about to hear this : warren has to run for leader because chuck schumer is too cozy with wall street . the senator from massachusetts is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run , but jackie kucinich of the daily beast says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left . `` what this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with chuck schumer , because he 's so close to wall street , and it 's an issue they 've really been hammering on , '' kucinich said . `` so watch for more of that , because i have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard , through warren or not . '' 2 . a good week for boehner . yes , you read that right . it has been a rocky year for house speaker john boehner , but his allies think they may have just turned a corner . the house of representatives passed the republican budget last week as well as a big medicare change known as the `` doc fix '' because it clarifies reimbursement rates to medicare providers . npr 's juana summers shared reporting on how team boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore . `` part of -lrb- his success -rrb- is because of the speaker 's willingness to use unconventional tactics , to work with democrat nancy pelosi for that medicare reform , '' summers said . `` congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return . so whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating . '' 3 . bush-rubio ? rubio-bush ? watch the real estate listings ! jeb bush and sen. marco rubio both call florida home . and both want to be the republican nominee for president . they also happen to be on friendly terms . so among florida republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a `` dream ticket . '' of course , it wo n't happen . ca n't happen . rules and all that pertaining to the president and vice president coming from the same state . -lrb- dick cheney changed his residency from texas to wyoming right before joining the george w. bush ticket . -rrb- . but ed o'keefe of the washington post said the obstacles are n't preventing florida republicans from doing a little dreaming . `` they say , look , bush has all this executive experience , he 's bilingual , he has a mexican-american wife , '' o'keefe said . `` rubio is young . he has an interest in foreign policy . why not ? '' 4 . ted cruz wants to `` rock '' the youth vote . much was made of the fact that liberty university students had no choice but to attend the campus convocation at which ted cruz announced his bid for the republican presidential nomination . but it gave cruz a big crowd -- and robert costa of the washington post reports that team cruz is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement . `` he 's playing at a lot of happy hours with young conservatives in the coming weeks and months , '' costa said . `` and he really believes he can ignite those young conservatives , who are n't really familiar with bush and are looking for someone new . '' 5 . is kasich waiting for a `` summer wave '' ? john kasich had a well-regarded visit to new hampshire last week . and he got a decent buzz out of a new york fund-raising stop , too . so is he ready to launch and join the crowded gop 2016 presidential field ? not so fast . two new hampshire republicans keeping close tabs on gop visitors say he would n't give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run . a national gop source plugged into to the kasich operation says the governor has n't made a firm decision , and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call . that , too , is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run . this national source said kasich is one of two gop governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring rollouts and create an opening for a `` summer wave '' of new entries . the other , according to this source , is gop michigan gov. rick snyder .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- there should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in washington this spring . peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long national cherry blossom festival , which kicks off friday and runs through april 12 . the fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between april 11 and april 14 . here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited d.c. blossoms : . the city 's first cherry trees were destroyed . in 1910 , 2,000 cherry trees arrived in washington , thanks to a gift from the city of tokyo and the advocacy of eliza ruhamah scidmore , one of the first female board members of the national geographic society . these trees , however , were riddled with disease and were destroyed . two years later , first lady helen herron taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from japan . winter 's almost over : see the proof . the festival was launched more than 20 years later . it was n't until 1935 that civic groups and the d.c. government came together to hold the first `` cherry blossom festival . '' that first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of washington school children . it 's not all about cherry trees . that 's right , there 's a blossom kite festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on march 28th . the festival consists of a hot tricks showdown , learning how to make and fly kites , and there 's even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites . two types of trees dominate . in the 1912 gift of trees to washington , there were 12 different varieties . today , two varieties are dominant -- yoshino and kwanzan . kwanzan trees are usually found in the east potomac park area and produce pink blossoms . the yoshino , which produce white blossoms , are closer to the northern part of the tidal basin near the washington monument . descendants of the original trees live in japan . in 2011 , about 120 trees propagated from d.c. 's surviving 1912 trees were sent back to japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees . over the years , cuttings from the original trees have also been returned to japan for horticultural projects .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the end of `` jinx , '' the six-part hbo documentary about real estate heir robert durst , has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution . durst , as you probably heard , is charged with murder in a killing in california 15 years ago , and he has been suspected , but never charged , in the disappearance of his first wife in new york . whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the constitution , as well as our fast-evolving ideas about privacy . while durst 's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial , the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in . let 's go over three main reasons why : . 1 . is this inadmissible hearsay ? probably not . hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth . it really just means a witness ca n't testify at trial about someone else 's version of the facts . if a sentence starts with `` he told me '' or `` she said that , '' it 's probably hearsay . as general proposition , hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible , but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception-riddled rule itself . perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions . these can be admitted against a defendant . why ? well , the idea is that these statements are reliable . the thinking is that people do n't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it . 2 . is this a violation of durst 's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination ? again , probably not . the rules of the u.s. constitution are a different matter . the fifth amendment 's self-incrimination clause states that '' -lsb- n -rsb- o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... '' by definition then , compulsory self-incrimination requires , well , `` compulsion . '' and not just any compulsion . the kind of compulsion targeted by the fifth amendment is governmental coercion . durst may still contend that his `` confession '' was n't voluntary . it 's true that confessions deemed `` involuntary '' are often excluded at trial under the due process clause of the 14th amendment . however , a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity . voluntariness is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person , such as a journalist . what of durst 's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police ? sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action , constitutionally speaking . this is not an easy case for a defendant to make , though . durst would have to establish that the hbo interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police . the police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians . but the police frequently benefit from the work of good samaritans or citizens volunteering information , photos or iphone videos . the television show `` america 's most wanted '' has been premised on this idea for decades . given the defendant 's burden here , it 's unlikely that he can convince a judge that , in light of all the circumstances , filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police . the bottom line is this : a voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will , not physical intimidation or psychological pressure . how was durst `` pressured '' when alone in the bathroom ? however , his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will . 3 . can durst argue for some `` reasonable expectation of privacy '' that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom ? not in our modern world , and not in this case . perhaps in decades past , a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom , but things have changed . subjects of documentaries and reality tv stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day . moreover , everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their `` hot '' mic . in this brave new media world , the rule appears to be : you wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk . this is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews . no matter how good an interviewee a client may be , audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites . admitting to killing `` them all '' would fall into this category . when it comes to giving interviews , it 's probably better for defendants such as durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt , especially doubt of the reasonable kind .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` the stomp '' remains one of the most controversial plays in ncaa history -- when duke 's christian laettner lifted his foot and stepped on kentucky 's aminu timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played , the 1992 ncaa east regional final . mention the stomp in a diner or bar in kentucky and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue-haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how laettner is the vilest human on earth . then , the woulda , coulda , shouldas begin : laettner should 've been kicked out ; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot ; kentucky should 've advanced to the final four . the stomp returned to headlines this week after espn aired a `` 30 for 30 '' documentary called `` i hate christian laettner , '' detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day . when it comes to the stomp , laettner says he decided to give a `` little payback '' while timberlake lay helpless on the ground . if kentucky fans needed more reason to hate laettner , those words might 've been it . but on twitter , laettner issued a video apology to timberlake , the first time he 'd ever done so : . timberlake could 've lashed back , but he 's too classy for that . he is one of the nicest guys you 'll ever meet . he remains active in basketball , coaching an eighth-grade girls travel-team in atlanta . -lrb- in full transparency , i coached with him last year . -rrb- . he responded to laettner , saying he appreciates and accepts the apology . but he makes it clear where his loyalty lies . at the end of his 23-second message , timberlake 's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with : `` go big blue . '' timberlake does n't dwell on the stomp . the thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by coach rick pitino after the game . pitino held up an old sports illustrated cover that said the kentucky program was in shambles . pitino told his players that although they lost on the court , his players had done something much bigger : they 'd put kentucky basketball back on the map . `` it put a lot of things in perspective , especially for a young team in a program that had just returned from heavy ncaa sanctions , '' timberlake says . `` all i remember is working with our heads down , attacking every practice and every game to the best of our ability . and that speech just reminded us of what was accomplished through that hard work , even in a loss . '' that is a message , he says , that still resonates in his life : `` sometimes you do n't see the full picture and do n't reap the immediate rewards of your work , but 9 times out of 10 good things do happen . '' timberlake has had fun with the stomp over the years , even donning a `` i still hate laettner '' t-shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when kentucky and duke played a couple years ago . he jokes that he 's not sure if he was `` a true hater '' of laettner like so many others . but that game will never quite sit well with kentucky players and fans . however , timberlake says the documentary gave him a new perspective on laettner that he thought he 'd never have . `` i can really respect his accomplishments , his basketball career and his passion for the game , '' timberlake says . do n't get him wrong . timberlake still bleeds kentucky blue . he 'd love to see kentucky play duke for the title this year , this time with the wildcats walking away as the winners . face off against your favorite anchors in the cnn march madness bracket challenge .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- former thai prime minister yingluck shinawatra has been ordered to stand trial over her role in a controversial rice subsidy scheme that cost the country billions . the first court hearing will take place on may 19 , a statement from thailand 's supreme court said . `` this case falls under the jurisdiction of the supreme court criminal division for persons holding political positions ... and the charges brought -lsb- against yingluck -rsb- are accepted , '' the statement said . if found guilty , she could face up to 10 years in prison . on her facebook page , yingluck said she behaved with integrity and honesty during her time as prime minister . `` i pledge that i have followed correct proceedings of the constitution , laws of the country in every way . '' the rice subsidy program , introduced in 2011 , pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop . but critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters , hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it could n't sell without losing money . anger over the scheme played a role in the protests that led to the downfall of yingluck 's government and a military coup in may last year . in january , thailand 's military-appointed national legislative assembly -lrb- nla -rrb- voted in favor of impeaching yingluck for her role in the rice program . though the vote was largely symbolic , as she had already lost her post , it carries a five-year ban from politics . cnn 's kocha olarn and journalist kiki dhitavat in bangkok contributed to this report .
omoa , honduras -lrb- cnn -rrb- alexis gonzález walks slowly and with some hesitation , using the outside wall of his house for balance . `` i 'm getting used to the prosthesis , '' the 16-year-old says . he tries to smile , but an expression of sadness quickly returns to his face . when he was 15 , gonzález made a decision that would forever change his life -- to leave omoa , an impoverished village in honduras -- with dreams of getting to the united states . at the end of the trek -- about 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,500 miles -rrb- across mexico and guatemala -- he saw hope , school , a job and the chance to send money home . `` sometimes we do n't even have food to eat and i also wanted to get a higher education , '' gonzález says . his mother was singlehandedly raising nine children , working odd jobs in restaurants and the nearby fields . they lived in a single room , an adobe house with dirt floors built on a steep and muddy hill . chickens being raised for food roamed around the structure . gonzález says his father left the family when he was little boy . when gonzalez left in january 2014 , he did n't ask his mother for permission . he only left a letter telling her about his plans . `` i would n't have let him go , '' his mother mercedes meléndez says . `` when he left i went looking for him everywhere . '' she even went to corinto on the honduras-guatemala border to ask authorities if they had seen him , she says . gonzález says he traveled by land through honduras and guatemala with a teenage cousin . they took the bus and also walked and hitch-hiked in some places . once in mexico , they got on the cargo train migrants call `` the beast . '' migrants get a risky , but free ride clinging to the outside of the train . violent gangs sometimes board the train to rape , rob and kill migrants . those without money to pay off the gangsters are thrown off , sometimes to their deaths in deep ravines or sharp rocks . gonzález says he never faced any gangs . things seem to be going well for him and his cousin for a while . they had been traveling for a few days on the train and were excited at nearing the u.s.-mexico border and crossing into the land of their dreams . but they were also tired . they ate what they could , but were unable to sleep for more than an hour at a time . they were hanging onto the grate above the train car 's couplers . `` we used our own sweaters to tie ourselves to the train so we would n't fall off , '' gonzález says . but tragedy was just around the corner . somehow , he does n't know how , he fell off the train while sleeping . he woke up bleeding profusely . `` the train had severed my right leg and part of my left heel , '' he says . he was eventually rescued by the mexican red cross and taken to a hospital where he recovered for a month . he stayed at a shelter for wounded migrants for another two months . there he was fitted with a prosthesis free of charge . it 's not difficult to find stories of minors in central america who have lost limbs , been kidnapped or died while trying to travel through mexico with the dream of migrating to the united states . juan armando enamorado , a 22-year-old who lives in the coastal town of tela , honduras , says he almost lost his life at 17 when he jumped off the train , fleeing from gangs . `` they got on the train to steal money from people . when i heard they were coming , i jumped off the train traveling at more than 30 mph , '' he says . enamorado says he was barely able to make it to the nearest town after walking for four days without food and very little water . children are fleeing endemic poverty and drug violence in central america . last year , u.s. immigration authorities in the united states detained nearly 18,000 minors from honduras as they were trying to cross the border without documents . altogether , more than 67,000 minors , mainly from central america , were detained , according to u.s. government figures . to understand why children are fleeing in droves , cnn traveled to san pedro sula , honduras . the second largest city in the country . it has the highest reported murder rate in the world . violence is fueled by turf wars between two powerful gangs that control entire neighborhoods . the honduran government is trying to change this harsh reality by deploying security forces to hotspots . vilma maldonado says her son was forced to leave because of death threats from gangs when he was only 15 years old . he left la lima , just outside san pedro sula , four years ago at the age of 19 . the last time she heard from him he was in monterrey , mexico , hoping to cross into the united states . `` sometimes i think he 's dead , '' maldonado says crying . `` but then i seek refuge in god and try to think the opposite and ask god to take these ideas out of my mind because if i 'm trusting god you have to have faith that my son is still alive . '' for monsignor rómulo emiliani , auxiliary bishop of san pedro sula , the migration of central american children to the united states is a regional disgrace . `` it 's something terrible , sad and shameful for us hondurans that nearly 18,000 of our children have desperately left because of hunger and violence . it 's a slap on our faces and there are people that do n't care about these 18,000 children . `` can you imagine the trip for a child who 's 4 , 6 , 10 , 12 years old all the way to the united states ? many girls have been fondled and raped by the smugglers , '' monsignor emiliani says . honduran president juan orlando hernández says his country has fallen victim to powerful criminal organizations fueled by drug dollars and weapons coming from the north and drugs from the south , but insists his government is working hard to stem the tide . `` we have our own responsibility . we accept that and we 're doing our work . we are pushing this forward with all that we have . other countries are responsible for this war that we 're living , '' president hernández says . back in omoa , mercedes meléndez , the mother of alexis gonzález , says she 's deeply worried about her son . `` he has told me that he 's depressed . he has recently been better , but he used to say he wanted to die . i was getting very worried because he said that he wanted to kill himself , '' meléndez says . the teenager says he now draws and writes to forget . he shows us a drawing of a family of four holding hands . he uses pastel colors and soft features in the drawing and inscribed words like `` happy , '' `` love , '' and `` i love you '' throughout . he may never be able to go to college or help his family the way he wanted . but asked if he regrets his decision to leave , he says he does n't : the rewards were so high , it was worth the incredible risk . and for countless others like him -- from across central america -- the same is true . and they will keep trying .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- on october 24 , 1944 , u.s. warplanes swarmed at the leviathan of battleships , japan 's musashi , splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it . it took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in world war ii to the bottom of the philippines ' sibuyan sea . this month , microsoft co-founder paul allen and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight-year search for the musashi . japanese maritime expert kazushige todaka is 90 % sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in march . and that 's a breakthrough . `` i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true , '' todaka said . unfortunately , japanese war ships did not bear their names on their sides , so a full identification takes a while . but the wreckage matched the ship 's description , and it had a mount for the imperial japanese navy seal , a chrysanthemum which was made out of teak and rotted away in the ship 's 70 years in the sea . on thursday , paul allen 's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves . an unmanned vehicle 's spotlights lit up the pitch darkness , revealing crisp high definition images of massive rusted iron in crystal clear turquoise water . the live tour began with one of the musashi 's many death blows -- a warped bow . `` what we see here is torpedo damage , '' said robert kraft , the expedition 's leader . torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship , belling the metal outward . the remote operated vehicle puttered past more fatal damage , as kraft and his team described it . a big dent pushing inward , he explained , was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship , exploding outside the hull , pushing it in . `` it 's the concussive force next to the ship , '' he said . the submersible showed multiple hits right under the musashi 's main gun , perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time . it weighed 270 tons , and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed . while in the musashi 's death throes , the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship 's deck , allen 's researchers said . it was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns . the musashi was the most heavily armed ship of its time , the researchers said . but the giant had an achilles heel . it was very vulnerable to torpedoes . the ship caught fire ; it lost most of its propeller power and began to flail . u.s. warplanes went in for the kill . `` no defenses would have saved her , '' an expedition member commented , as the submersible drifted past one gun turret or gun mount after the next . as the musashi sank , parts of it , where air was trapped imploded . the wreck landed in pieces on the sea floor with some 1,000 crew members . about 1,300 more were rescued by other japanese ships , including the executive officer . the camera appeared to spare viewers any skeletal remains , but among unfired shells and bent iron , small objects peered at the lens . could the small chain have been a necklace ? pocket watch chain ? those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on allen 's website . launched in 1940 , the musashi was , at the time , in the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons . it had a twin , the yamato . the u.s. navy sank the musashi during the battle of the sibuyan sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf in the central philippines . microsoft billionaire allen has said his long fascination with world war ii history was inspired by his father 's service in the u.s. army . to finally arrive at the wreck , kraft 's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices , such as the bluefins that have searched for missing airliner malaysia airlines flight 370 . nearly a decade passed before they had the wreck in their sites . `` that moment of discovery was exhilarating , '' kraft said . cnn 's euan mckirdy , jethro mullen , yoko wakatsuki and brad lendon contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- indiana is declaring a public health emergency in one county due to an epidemic of hiv . gov. mike pence issued the order thursday for scott county , which has 79 confirmed cases of hiv since mid-december . the county averages about five new cases a year . `` scott county is facing an epidemic of hiv , but this is not a scott county problem ; this is an indiana problem , '' pence said in a news release . all the cases in the current outbreak are linked to injection drug use , primarily of the prescription opioid opana . the declaration requires law enforcement , emergency agencies and health officials to develop a response plan that also includes hospitals and health care providers . a team from the cdc division of hiv/aids prevention arrived monday and is working with local and state health officials to stop the outbreak . their recommendations include a short-term needle exchange program and public awareness campaign focusing on safe sex , needle disposal , addiction services , and hiv testing and treatment . hiv can take up to three months to appear in a person 's system after they are infected . health officials recommend people who have participated in risky behavior , such as needle sharing and unprotected sex , to be tested for hiv now and again in three months . `` i am confident that together we will stop this hiv outbreak in its tracks , '' pence said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- lewis hamilton has conquered the world of formula one but becoming a global superstar is a far bumpier ride . sporting ability has been transformed into lasting celebrity by footballers like pele and david beckham and nba star michael jordan . at the age of 30 -- and with the fastest car in the world at his fingertips -- hamilton is at the peak of his powers . during sunday 's season-opening australian grand prix in melbourne , millions of hardcore hamilton fans will bite their fingernails and hold their breath when their hero returns to the track in his mercedes racing car . but will the briton 's quest for a third world title in 2015 even register with the average joe ? half a billion tv viewers watch f1 across the year , a figure which pales in comparison with the 4.7 billion football fans who watch the english premier league over the course of a season . jon stainer , managing director of leading sport and entertainment market research company repucom , argues that hamilton , however , is already gaining wider recognition . `` on a global scale lewis already sits in the top half of all celebrities across sport , arts and music , '' he told cnn . repucom monitors celebrity trends by a monthly survey of the general public where 5,000 famous faces are rated according to certain parameters . those who rank in their study of the world 's top-20 faces includes actors angelina jolie and leonardo dicaprio , singers madonna and jennifer lopez , footballer beckham and microsoft co-founder and philanthropist bill gates . `` we look at celebrity awareness and other metrics like likeability , whether they are seen as trendsetters , the level of trust people place in them and whether people aspire to have a life like that celebrity . `` we are starting to see lewis go beyond the traditional formula one audience into the mainstream audience . `` some of that is spurred on by his on-off relationship with -lsb- former girlfriend -rsb- nicole scherzinger . those stories put him in the headlines beyond the back pages . '' hamilton split from popstar and tv personality scherzinger for the fourth time in february after a seesawing seven-year relationship . he may no longer be one half of motorsport 's `` posh and becks '' but he 's not been shy of socializing with stars from other spheres . just 10 days before the australian gp , hamilton was partying at paris fashion week with musician and producer kanye west and his wife kim kardashian . mixing with celebrity friends has raised hamilton 's profile , and for some of his fans that is part of his appeal , but there is also a danger of alienating his petrolhead devotees . the famous friends , bright red private jet -- complete with traveling pampered pooches roscoe and coco -- and forays into song writing might be at odds with the perceived image of a feisty f1 world champion . marketing expert steve martin , who worked with hamilton in his role as ceo of m&c saatchi sport and entertainment , warned the driver 's lifestyle could be `` a bit showy . '' `` i 'm not sure if in any walk of life people like showy people , '' he told cnn . `` and so why should that be different on the international stage in a sporting context ? '' christopher thomas , a hamilton super-fan from new york , says : `` hanging out with top celebrities is n't a problem as long as it does n't interfere with his ability to race . `` as long as he shows up to the race and does what he 's supposed to , everything is fine . '' hamilton has often split opinion with his emotional approach to racing . unlike his seemingly unflappable mercedes teammate nico rosberg , the briton races with his heart on his sleeve . for some , that passionate impulse is exactly what draws them to him . `` lewis is cautious and aggressive all at the same time , '' says brazilian fan melissa , who shows her support for the mercedes driver by referring to herself as mel `` hamilton . '' `` sometimes i think i will have a heart attack watching him ! `` he does not live by certain standards . he is not hiding . he is authentic . '' thomas agrees : `` he 's so popular because you see him show his emotions . he stays true to himself . '' hamilton 's fiery responses have helped make him a fearless , instinctive driver who gives no ground on track . consider the mental resolve required to win both his world titles at the final race of the season -- or , in the case of his 2008 triumph with mclaren in brazil , at the very last corner . but then there have been the meltdowns , which reached their nadir in a tumultuous 2011 season when hamilton had an ongoing spat with ferrari driver felipe massa -- at one point calling his driving skills `` frickin ' ridiculous '' -- and controversially criticized the race stewards in monaco . `` a lot of commentators diss lewis for being open about his emotional life , '' says tom roope , whose company the rumpus room creates hamilton 's digital media . `` there is that marmite-ness -- you either love him or hate him . `` but i think people like the fact that he 's not running around trying to be perfect . '' his hot-blooded impulses do allow a fleeting glimpse into the real hamilton . following hamilton at grands prix over the last six years , he 's not a very visible driver compared to others who can be seen chatting with team members and guests inside the motorhomes . he is courteous and friendly in media briefings , where he will often chew on a handful of sweets , but it is hard to get beyond the façade of the pr-trained f1 driver and understand what he is really like . marketing and pr expert martin believes hamilton could improve his global popularity by opening up a little more . `` if i were to do one or two things , i 'd like to make him more natural , to make him relax and be more comfortable in his own skin , '' advised martin , whose clients include footballer cristiano ronaldo , another athlete who has successfully transcended his sport . `` when he talks to use a language that is n't so robotic . humility and having a common touch is a very big skill that people forget . `` beckham is the best example , he can show humility , he 's down to earth , he 's a smiler and he takes the highs and lows in his career very well . `` he has that continuous appeal that is so enduring , and you can take a lot of lessons from that . '' if hamilton is to extend his celebrity beyond the sporting sphere , he could do well to follow beckham 's example in another area too -- philanthropy . the former manchester united , real madrid and la galaxy star retired two years ago but he has been an ambassador for children 's charity unicef for the last decade . he and his popstar-turned-fashion-designer wife victoria have their own charitable trust . when beckham signed for french club paris saint-germain in 2013 he also donated his multi-million dollar wages to charity . hamilton has also contributed to unicef 's campaigns and during a break last season he traveled to haiti to see first hand the charity 's work there with malnourished children . `` being involved in charity and community work is a way lewis can develop his appeal beyond f1 and the sport audience , '' suggests stainer . `` that 's how beckham managed to mold and transform his character and marketability towards the end of his playing career . `` lewis can also touch the lives of more people but that is a difficult thing to do when you 're at the peak of your career . '' martin agrees that having a strategy for his career beyond sport is absolutely essential to maintaining a high profile . `` we 've worked with lewis for a number of years and he 's been brilliant but it 's not about living in the moment , it 's about having a plan that evolves , '' he added . `` how does he make sure his appeal is so enduring that it lasts beyond his formula one career ? '' hamilton still has plenty of racing left in the tank . ferrari 's kimi raikkonen is the oldest driver on the 2015 grid and the finn will turn 36 in october . for now , at least , there is one relatively easy way for hamilton , allied with mercedes ' powerful car , to crank up his kudos . `` win more championships , '' says thomas . `` and win more races in the u.s. and canada . `` f1 is still growing in the u.s. and when it comes to celebrity status the u.s. has a big deal to do with what happens globally . `` if you 're a celebrity in the u.s. then it transcends outwards into other countries . '' could winning a third world title with mercedes push hamilton into the ranks of f1 's greatest drivers and deeper into the public consciousness ? `` he 's the favorite in 2015 because the mercedes gap to the others is so big that even if it 's reduced , it 's probably still going to be there , '' hamilton 's biographer mark hughes told cnn over the winter . `` lewis is in a position to make it a great career and if he keeps winning titles he will be recognized as one of the giants . '' hamilton has already raced his way to riches from rags , becoming f1 's first black star , a winner of 33 grands prix and two world titles , against a backdrop of racing rivalry and a rocky celebrity romance . on sunday , another chapter will be written in the double world champion 's rollercoaster story when the 2015 season fires up around melbourne 's albert park . so , what next ? `` lewis is a bit like a soap opera , '' says roope . `` it 's amazing how much drama there is around him . '' `` you need to create a story around somebody to have ongoing appeal , '' says martin . `` what makes great sports people , the ones that fans like over time , are those who come back from tremendous highs and lows -- that 's a great story . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- he 's a rolls royce footballer who honed his game in his parents ' garage . and even at the age of 40 , former juventus star alessandro del piero is still purring along , showing no signs of running out of gas . the record-breaking striker is currently enjoying an indian summer to his football career , completing stints at sydney fc in australia and more recently at the delhi dynamos in the inaugural indian super league . inevitably , the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that does n't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he 's still enjoying himself so much . `` about football , i love every single moment -- the life with teammates , the atmosphere before a game , the free kicks , the goals . i love every moment like the first one , '' del piero told cnn 's human to hero series . the man dubbed `` il pinturicchio '' -lrb- `` the little artist '' -rrb- has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in italy . during 19 seasons at juventus he won 15 trophies including six serie a crowns and a european champions league title , as well as setting club records for appearances and goals . in all , del piero made 705 appearances for the bianconeri -- including a record 478 in serie a -- and scored 289 goals along the way . `` i 'm very proud about the records because i do everything for the club . i 've had some great moments with the club , with the fans -lrb- and -rrb- with my teammates , '' he says . raised in the town of conegliano in northern italy , del piero 's love for football was fostered by his late father , gino . `` my childhood was fantastic . i trained and played every moment and in every space of my home , '' he recalls . `` you know northern italy is very cold -- you can not play outside , so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space . i would play alone , with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer . '' del piero turned professional at the age of 17 , joining serie b side padova in 1991 before being snapped up by juventus for $ 2.6 million two years later . his longstanding relationship with the `` old lady , '' as juventus is affectionately known , got off on the right foot almost from the start . del piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year , becoming a first-team regular standing in for injured star striker roberto baggio . the two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level , with both netting 27 times for their country , but their defining moments for the azzurri could not have been more contrasting . while baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed brazil victory in the 1994 fifa world cup final , del piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football 's biggest stage . after being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002 , del piero and italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in germany , beating france on penalties in a final remembered primarily for zinedine zidane 's headbutt on italy defender marco materazzi . victory in the final was a `` beautiful '' moment but del piero 's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier . `` the most special moment in my head , and probably the heads of my teammates , was the semifinal , '' he says . `` definitely the final , when you take the cup and lift it to the sky , it 's beautiful . but the semifinal was the most exciting . we played the home team for 120 minutes . there is a big connection between our two countries . it was incredible . '' an epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes , with extra time going the same way , before fabio grosso netted in the 119th minute followed by a del piero effort moments later . `` i ca n't hide that my greatest victory is the world cup . since you 're a kid you think you want to win that . it was massive , '' he says . italy 's third world cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in italy 's domestic league as juventus and other serie a teams were implicated in the `` calciopoli '' match-fixing scandal . the repercussions would see former juventus managing director luciano moggi banned for life by the italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two serie a titles won in 2005 and 2006 , relegated to serie b and docked nine points . the demotion to italy 's second tier saw some top players leave the club , including italy captain fabio cannavaro , france defender lilian thuram and sweden striker zlatan ibrahimovic . but the ever-faithful del piero stayed put , helping juventus secure the serie b title and an immediate return to the top flight . `` i think that staying with juventus in serie b , even before i knew how large the points penalty was going to be , was the best decision i could 've made , '' del piero said last year . `` i had an extraordinary season that gave extra meaning to everything that came afterwards , including the -lrb- serie a -rrb- trophy i lifted on the last game at the juventus stadium . '' del piero also scored in that final league match against atalanta in may 2012 and was afforded a hero 's send-off with a 20-minute standing ovation after his substitution in the second half . `` there were many people crying that day . i was very emotional . i tried to hide my tears by bowing down to pick up some scarfs and cleaning my eyes . it was a very special and touching moment ... it will stay with me forever , '' he recalls . a open letter to juventus ' fans confirmed his exit the following july before signing a two-year deal to play for sydney fc in australia 's a-league in a deal worth aus$ 4 million -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- . he was soon helping repay that fee , netting a trademark free kick on his home debut -- one of 24 goals scored during his time down under . del piero has since gone on to help promote the new indian super league , appearing in the inaugural competition late last year . so what plans does the veteran have for 2015 ? `` my future plan is to find a good restaurant tonight and have a rest and then tomorrow is another day , '' he says cheekily before suggesting that his playing days may not be over just yet . `` i have two or three situations to analyze . i want to take some time to make a good decision like i did in the past , '' he adds . `` i would love to play again , i want to play with good people around me . i 'm still training now -- i want to keep myself ready for a big decision .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the story of the jews in the united states is a testament to `` american exceptionalism '' and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in europe and muslim lands . in fact , the economic prosperity and social standing of america 's jews shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities . this positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the newport , rhode island , hebrew congregation in 1790 by president george washington : `` it is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights , for , happily , the government of the united states ... gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance . '' since then , american jews have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors , senators , mayors , cabinet officers and in the military , and today , most american adults are unaware of and do n't seem to care who 's jewish . thus it comes as a shock when at the university of california los angeles , a jewish woman student applicant for the student council 's judicial board is initially rejected after being asked : `` given that you are a jewish student and very active in the jewish community , how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view ? '' according to the new york times , the discussion that followed had `` seemed to echo the kind of questions , prejudices and tropes -- particularly about divided loyalties -- that have plagued jews across the globe for centuries . '' the minutes and video of the event suggest some student leaders seemed to be auditioning for the salem witch trials and others for jobs as political commissars in communist north korea . and in february , at another university of california campus in davis , jewish students opposed to a student council resolution advocating a boycott of israel were heckled by cries of `` allahu akbar '' and a jewish fraternity house was daubed with a swastika . chancellor gene block of ucla called the dust up on his campus a `` teachable moment . '' yes , agreed . it seems ucla 's diverse body of students requires remedial classes in civics . would ucla students consider it appropriate to ask u.s. supreme court justices ruth bader ginsburg and elena kagan similarly hostile and demeaning questions ? apparently it 's necessary for the university to teach its student leadership that the u.s. constitution bans religious tests for public office . while they are at it , they also can inform them that the bill of rights assures freedom of religion , speech and assembly to all citizens . california 's university administrators might need to be reminded that title 6 of the civil rights act of 1964 applies to all americans , and they have an obligation to ensure equal educational opportunity for all students . this includes , among other things , promptly and effectively addressing certain hostile environments . as for the uc davis students , they need to learn that support for israel is a legitimate american tradition . a century ago , supreme court justice louis d. brandeis asserted : `` zionism is the pilgrim inspiration and impulse all over again ... to be good americans , we must be better jews , and to be better jews , we must become zionists . '' students are of course free to disagree with brandeis but not to harass or intimidate jews who support his argument . the events in california might be regarded as isolated incidents and youthful excesses of the type that has always marked campus life . except of course that is not true . this type of hatred , stereotyping and bias is a worrying new development that suggests a generational problem . in our recent study , my trinity college colleague , ariela keysar , and i found that 54 % of jewish students reported experiencing or witnessing ant-semitism on campus during the six months of september 2013-march 2014 . our survey covered 1,157 jewish students on 55 campuses . the patterns and high rates of anti-semitism that were reported were surprising . another finding was that female students were more likely than males -lrb- 58 % versus 51 % -rrb- to report anti-semitism . jewish women seem more vulnerable on campus today . america 's universities need to foster american exceptionalism and values . they should take special care to avoid following current `` european fashion trends . '' the situation in france today demonstrates the price of failing to nip youthful extremism in the bud . twenty years ago , complaints by jewish students in paris that they were subject to anti-semitism from a strange coalition of marxist , fascist and islamist groups were ignored by complacent university and government officials . the dangerous streets of paris are witness to what results when a country ignores problems and panders to extremist opinions . the army is currently deployed across france to protect synagogues and jewish community buildings . but history has taught us what begins with the jews does n't end with the jews . the french army also has to defend the nation 's shopping malls , government buildings and of course , its cartoonists .

moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- kim jong un is expected to attend world war ii anniversary celebrations in moscow at russia 's invitation , a russian official speaking on condition of anonymity said thursday . north korea accepted russia 's invitation , but russia is waiting on pyongyang to make the official announcement about the may trip , the official said . this would mark kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership in late 2011 . `` the invitation was sent to kim jong un . north korea accepted the invitation . the leadership of north korea is expected to take part in victory day celebrations in moscow , '' the russian official said . the official later clarified : `` by leadership , we 're talking about kim . '' so far , north korean state media has not issued any statement about the invitation . this year 's victory day marks the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii . chatter over whether kim would make his first official overseas trip during the pivotal anniversary started in late december after russian state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation to pyongyang . on december 22 , russian presidential aide yuri ushakov told itar-tass : `` first signals are given from pyongyang that the north korean leader plans to come to moscow and attend celebrations . '' recently , russia and north korea have been fostering warmer relations . if kim appears in russia along with other world leaders , he may look like a minor figure , said dr. leonid petrov , an asian studies professor who specializes in the political history of north korea . `` in a setting with a large crowd of state officials , in group pictures , he would look like a minor figure instead of what he 's portrayed in north korean media as supreme leader , invincible marshal , jack of all trades . `` so i think if kim jong un decides to go to moscow , he 's going to look like a very lonely , lonely figure . '' the kremlin has invited 68 world leaders to its victory day celebrations on may 9 , said russian foreign minister sergey lavrov as quoted on russian network rt. . he was quoted in russian media as saying that chinese president xi jinping will also attend . in the last year , russia and north korea , two historical allies , have increasingly established stronger ties as russian president vladimir putin faces international backlash over the war in ukraine . the two countries declared 2015 their `` friendship year . '' both countries have been slapped with sanctions by the united states and are facing international isolation . `` north korea is a convenient friend for moscow -- it 's anti-american and it 's in a key place of asia , '' petrov said . `` russia lost many of its traditional allies -- it needs friends , both economically , politically , strategically . '' ties between north korea and russia date back to world war ii , when kim jong un 's grandfather and founder of the country , kim il sung , trained as a communist guerrilla leader in the soviet union . throughout kim 's subsequent reign , the soviet union backed the nation . after the soviet union crumbled in the early 1990s , north korea became increasingly reliant on china . kim 's father , kim jong il , visited moscow several times , with his last visit in 2011 . the late kim rode into russia in an armored train -lrb- he disliked flying -rrb- and met with both putin and prime minister dmitry medvedev . `` moscow undertook a diplomatic offensive '' with north korea , said petrov , of australian national university . `` it absolved $ 10 billion of soviet-era debts from the account books and started rebooting relationships between north korea and russia . '' last year , russia forgave 90 % of north korea 's $ 11 billion debt . cnn 's alla eshchenko reported in moscow , and madison park wrote and reported in hong kong . cnn 's jessica king contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- israel 's ruling likud party pulled off a victory in tuesday 's election -- and it was a stunning one . during the campaign , incumbent prime minister benjamin netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum , for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the white house , to his fixation on the iran nuclear issue , to allegations over netanyahu 's household expenses . yet despite this unpromising backdrop , likud is on course to win 30 seats in the knesset , six seats more than the main opposition zionist union -- headed by isaac herzog and tsipi livni , and an obvious favorite of the israeli media establishment and europe , washington , and the west bank . the blow to the zionist union is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading likud as the campaign drew to a close . -lrb- likud was n't the only winner of the night -- the new center-right party kulanu -lrb- all of us -rrb- , which focuses on the economy , also had a good showing , securing 10 seats -rrb- . still , likud 's resounding has n't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks , the work of negotiating a coalition will begin . with this in mind , there is a good chance that president reuven rivlin will ask netanyahu to form a national unity government , either with the zionist union , or as the head of a right-wing coalition -lrb- although the bitter rivalry between herzog/livni and netanyahu during the campaign makes the latter more likely -rrb- . overall , the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate , with even voters who self-identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the palestinian issue and broader questions of national security . meanwhile , the numbers for the left in tuesday 's election -- a four seats for meretz , 24 for the zionist union and 14 for the arab list suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition . as a result , the international community and the palestinian leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the palestinian state will be conducted with the center-right . so , what can we expect from the new netanyahu government ? issues that dominated the campaign , namely security and the economy , will likely dominate . for a start , netanyahu will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform . the issue of housing requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the israel land authority and planning and zoning processes . but to address these issues properly , netanyahu will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors , meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term . in addition , netanyahu will also have to repair the fractured relationship with washington , something that may not be easy given that ties with the obama administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over iran is reached , and what shape such a deal takes . that raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security , and on this , the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo . this is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that israel should instead move beyond a short-term approach and toward building a long-term , comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power . making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the israeli-palestinian conflict , rather than merely kicking the can down the road . restarting communication with the west bank leadership and properly engaging with the arab peace initiative would be steps in the right direction . all that said , this will be netanyahu 's fourth term in office , and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory . and that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long-tern national security strategy . those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- ted cruz is back in his favorite place : the spotlight . as the first candidate to quit the charade of `` exploring '' a presidential run and actually jumping in , the texas republican senator presented an image monday of decisiveness and vision -- all before an auditorium of mostly supportive young evangelicals . now comes the hard part . cruz must make inroads with wide swaths of the gop if he hopes to break through as a top-tier candidate . he does n't have many friends in the party establishment thanks to his hard-line tactics on issues like obamacare . and he 's facing steep competition for the conservative vote from the likes of wisconsin gov. scott walker . even evangelicals , cruz 's target audience during his launch speech at liberty university , are n't firmly in his column . the firebrand 's decision to jump-start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded gop field where multiple republicans will vie for the same social and evangelical support base . `` ted is clearly a player , '' said tony perkins , president of the family research council , a christian public policy ministry . `` but the competition this cycle is very steep . '' by choosing liberty university in virginia , which was founded by fundamentalist preacher jerry falwell , to roll out his long shot campaign , cruz made clear he wo n't cede the christian right to another candidate . `` from the dawn of this country , at every stage , america has enjoyed god 's providential blessing , '' said cruz , roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a sunday morning . `` over and over again , when we faced impossible odds , the american people rose to the challenge . you know , compared to that , repealing obamacare and abolishing the irs ai n't all that tough . '' liberty offered cruz a ready-made crowd : young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands , because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation . this is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful christian idealists cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire . but cruz wo n't have this political territory all to himself . several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red t-shirts emblazoned with `` rand , '' referring to kentucky sen. rand paul , who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives . meanwhile , walker , with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions , seems to have eclipsed cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the white house . `` when the grass roots look at a guy like scott walker -- he can not only bridge the divide , we believe , in the republican party , but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in wisconsin , '' said jennifer stefano , a pennsylvania tea party activist . `` that 's what i think is dominating ted cruz -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013 , as when he tried to stop and defund obamacare . '' cruz must also face off against paul , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum and dr. ben carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task . `` it 's a crowded field to begin with and it 's almost as if , within the republican contest , there are some early sub-primaries : who is going to be the establishment candidate ? who is going to be the social conservative candidate ? '' said david yepsen , who was for years the dean of iowa caucus reporters from his perch at the des moines register . meanwhile , a cnn/orc international poll last week put cruz as the choice of 4 % of likely republican voters . so if he seems unlikely to win , why would cruz get in -- and so early ? paradoxically , the size of the task facing cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign -- may not apply . perkins said he had been assured by cruz personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination -- and ultimately the presidency -- despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the white house with the almost unanimous disapproval of the republican establishment . announcing now could give cruz more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals . he used his speech monday to also slam common core education standards and immigration reform , areas where establishment gop favorite jeb bush is perceived to be vulnerable . he also joined the hawkish republican barrage on foreign policy , slamming president barack obama over his row with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his record on iran and combating `` radical islamic terrorism . '' but should he fall short in his 2016 bid , a successful campaign that positions cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run . and at only age 44 , there 's plenty of time for that . his texas senate seat , meanwhile , seems to be his as long as he wants it . he does n't have to run for re-election until 2018 , so a presidential bid would n't get in the way of the day job . so in a sense , cruz may not have that much to lose . another reason to get in early is iowa . the state is going to be crucial for cruz 's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path . a win in the first-in-the-nation caucus could crown cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party . but he is going to be facing proven iowa campaigners . huckabee won the state in 2008 and santorum won a recount over the eventual gop nominee , mitt romney , in 2012 . both have substantial networks of support and , crucially , know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything . `` i think cruz has generated some excitement in iowa , and he is a new face , '' said yepsen . `` but it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists . '' an added bonus for cruz getting in now : the early bird gets the best coverage . in a matter of weeks , republican presidential announcements from the massive gop field will draw little more than a shrug , so getting out ahead of expected announcements from paul and florida sen. marco rubio could be a good idea . when democrat hillary clinton makes her official plunge into the 2016 race , any republican candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks . monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day obamacare was signed into law . because cruz has spent endless hours trying to overturn it -- winning the appreciation of conservative activists in the process -- monday was a good moment to highlight the point . then there is money . cruz , unlike some other potential republican candidates , may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign . his early announcement gives him time for a post-announcement spurt before the next quarterly fundraising figures close at the end of the month , and a full three months to put up an impressive number in the next quarter .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- growing up in germany , everything felix von der osten learned about native americans came from the books of 19th-century german writer karl may . may 's most beloved characters , a noble apache leader named winnetou and his cowboy blood brother old shatterhand , are said to be more popular today in germany than the works of thomas mann , the 20th-century nobel prize-winning author of `` death in venice . '' it was n't until von der osten drove through south dakota last year , bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic black hills , that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were . intrigued , the 25-year-old photographer began researching native american history . what he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to indian country to capture the good , the bad and the ugly . `` i wanted to show a slice of life -lrb- through -rrb- the beauty and richness of the culture , '' he said . `` i did n't want to do reportage . i wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs , like historical documents .

'' over time , they opened their homes to him and his camera . his choice of a pentax 67 medium-format roll film camera forced him to carefully consider each shot , to `` create images '' in his head before taking them . it left him with a focused body of work . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . he captured sacred tribal rituals and ceremonies along with the more mundane , familiar aspects of life : the tribal basketball team , a horse grazing in a field , a girl sitting on a bunk bed with a stuffed pony , the inside of a casino . through conversations with tribal members , he also learned of the harsh realities of life on the reservation , from the difficulties youths face in pursuing educational opportunities to the drug and alcohol addiction killing some members . he put the camera away for some of his most memorable experiences -- a sit in the sweat lodge , dinner with his host family -- the ones that formed lasting relationships and earned him the nickname `` the man who crossed the ocean .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- during a conversation with a professor at an ivy league college , a mother nudges her daughter to share how she 's president of her school 's `` survivors-of-bulimia '' group . hoping to impress the yale admissions committee , a student writes an essay about the time she was so engrossed in a discussion with a french teacher she admired that she urinated on herself instead of interrupting the teacher or leaving the room . looking to give their child an edge , parents hire a college admissions consultant when their child is in the eighth grade and know the total tab will be roughly $ 50,000 . how i wish i could report that those three nuggets were pure fiction , morsels from my imagination for a great storyline for a novel or television series . but sadly , they are all-too-real examples included in a provocative new book `` where you go is not who you 'll be : an antidote to the college admissions mania '' by award-winning new york times op-ed columnist and bestselling author frank bruni . those examples , bruni said , should really be `` wake-up calls '' for any parents or students currently engaged in , or one day likely to be consumed by , the `` what school will i get into ? '' annual game . `` this says that we are attaching a level of importance to this that is just completely bonkers , '' bruni said during a recent interview . student goes 8 for 8 in ivy league college admissions . for many families in the united states , the challenge is n't getting into the right college . it is being able to afford the school of their choice , or any school for that matter . but for many middle - and upper-income families , the college admissions process is as frenzied as ever with the belief that one school can make or break a child 's future . i had to ask bruni , whom i met during my time covering presidential politics , how exactly college admissions became so insanely intense and ridiculously competitive . we both laughed that the process was definitely not nearly as manic or as charged when we both went to college in the '80s . bruni points to a number of factors all mixed together , creating `` this kind of perfect storm of just absolute fixation , panic , etc. '' about where kids are going to go to school , whether it 's exclusive enough and whether they 've `` breached the inner sanctum . '' there 's the economic pessimism over the past decade , combined with a widening chasm between the haves and have-nots , he said . `` i think all of that has made parents feel anxious on behalf of their kids and has made them feel like their kids have to have anything that might be a leg up , and if an elite school is a leg up , well , then dammit , let 's get them that . '' adding to the dangerous brew , says bruni , is the `` whole test prep and college coaching industry . '' yes , it has become an industry , with parents and students willing to pay thousands of dollars to consultants for an extra edge . that `` industry '' did n't exist just three decades ago when frank and i were applying . 5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education . the final piece of the puzzle are the colleges , which have essentially become businesses , marketing themselves and using their acceptance rate as a bragging right . `` so when you have colleges drumming up extra applications so that they can then claim an acceptance rate below 15 % , that becomes part of the discussion that adds to the anxiety because you look at these numbers and you think , ` oh my god , if i do n't begin doing sat prep as a freshman in high school , if i do n't hire the private tutor , ' '' i wo n't get in -- or so the thinking goes , said bruni . but how much does where you go really determine how successful you will ultimately be ? consider the fortune 500 and the alma maters of the heads of the 10 companies with the highest gross revenues back in the summer of 2014 . there was only one ivy league school on the list -lrb- dartmouth -rrb- , bruni says in his book . when you look at the fortune 500 executives in the top 30 , you see cornell , princeton and brown , but also the university of central oklahoma , the university of pittsburgh and the university of minnesota , he writes . the point is there is n't one exact path to the corner office , and an ivy league degree or a degree from another prestigious private university is neither a requirement nor a guarantee . national politics is another case in point . sure , there are presidents who hail from the ivies -lrb- george w. bush , bill clinton -rrb- but there are many who do n't : ronald reagan went to eureka college , a small school in illinois , and richard nixon got his undergraduate degree from whittier college in southern california . looking at other national politicians who either ran for or could run for president someday , new jersey gov. chris christie and vice president joe biden graduated from the university of delaware , paul ryan from miami university of ohio and john edwards from north carolina state university . bruni said a big reason for writing the book was that when he surveyed the accomplished people he has known and interviewed , there did n't seem to be any `` exaggerated concentration '' of people coming from the most selective colleges . `` so the amount of importance that parents and kids seem to be attaching to the selectiveness of where they went to school did not seem to me to jibe at all with the ingredients of success as manifest in the people i 've met who were successful and even more to the point content , '' he said . `` and so i felt like that contradiction really needed to be pointed out in a bold way . '' part of what fuels the perception that the most successful among us always attend the most selective schools is what we see and read about people who 've made it . for instance , take the `` 30 under 30 '' list , which forbes magazine puts out every year . bruni writes about how back in 2013 , a website called the 60second recap noted how every time honorees attended a school like harvard , stanford or princeton , it was mentioned in the profile . but if they had n't graduated from such a school , forbes did n't mention their alma mater . `` so why do we get the impression that so many of the world 's most glittering people went to these schools ? because when they 've gone to those schools , we make it part of their biography because we think it explains something . and when they have n't gone to those schools , we skip right over it because we think it 's actually contradictory evidence when it may be anything but . '' one of the most poignant stories that bruni shares in his book is the letter matt levin 's parents wrote to him the night before he received his first college response . levin , like many of his classmates at cold spring harbor high school on long island , had ivy on his mind . he hoped for admission to yale , princeton or brown , and he did everything to be a standout candidate : studying with a tutor for the sats , playing on the varsity baseball team , earning one of the highest grade point averages as a junior and volunteering for more than 100 hours of community service . the letters came , and levin got rejected by all three . his mom and dad , in their letter , wrote , `` your worth as a person , a student and our son is not diminished or influenced in the least by what these colleges have decided . if it does not go your way , you 'll take a different route to get where you want . '' a letter to my son as he leaves for college . `` what i love about matt levin 's parents and that story is ... they were saying , we know you 've been filled with these aspirations . we may have been agents of filling you with them , '' said bruni . `` what they were saying is this is one metric in a life with many of them . do not turn this metric into a bludgeon that you are beating yourself up with , and that 's what i think parents need to do . '' is it possible to restore any sanity to the entire college admissions process ? bruni said what we can do is try to change the conversation and begin to also talk about the negative consequences of this push to get into the most selective school . `` if we give kids too much of an impression that the name on their diploma is going to be everything , we run the risk of also telling them that their diploma is going to do the work for them . '' kids who feel that way often end up in therapy or completely incapable of carving out a life , he said . `` if we talk about all the things that happen , all the negative things that attend an over-concentration on getting into an elite school , then maybe we will begin to not concentrate as much on getting into elite schools . '' bruni hopes parents and students read his book , but he especially hopes graduating seniors read it before they head off to school . because while we spend so much time worrying about where our kids are going to get in , we spend less time on what they are going to do and explore when they get there . `` so my dream audience are kids going off to college , and kids who are going off to college ... being made to think about more than the name on their sweatshirt and being made to ponder what they 're going to do with this extraordinary privilege . '' do you think going to an elite college gives you a leg up when it comes to professional success ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a gloved hand reaches for a scantily-clad backside . it could be an image from the hit television series `` mad men , '' which documented the ribald world of advertising in 1960s america . except this is 2015 and `` who squeezes them in harelbeke ? '' is the poster strapline for the elite e3 harelbeke competition in belgium , accompanied by that gloved cyclist 's hand poised to pinch a woman 's bottom . unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt , the controversial advertisement was n't dreamed up out of thin air . it 's inspired by previous winner slovak peter sagan , who pinched a podium girl 's behind at the 2013 tour de flanders -- something he later apologized for , saying `` i promise to act more respectfully in the future . '' a week earlier , he was also pictured on the e3 harelbeke podium , making an ass-grabbing motion towards another flower girl . e3 harelbeke 's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign , sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard . `` old boy 's club '' `` a guy grabbing a woman 's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault , '' said kathryn bertine , former professional cyclist and director of `` half the road , '' a documentary about female racers . `` this poster makes cycling look very outdated . they 're relying on a ` good old boys club ' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing . '' judging by e3 harelebeke 's provocative standards , the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years . in 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field , while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside . more baffling was last year 's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike . `` such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products , but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago , '' said simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university . `` i think e3 harelbeke are rather out of kilter with the way that most people think today . '' `` a playful nod '' cycling 's world governing body , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- has since requested the poster be removed , to which the e3 harelbeke organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves . `` personally , no i do n't think it 's sexist , '' marc claerhout , e3 harelebeke manager , told cnn . could he see why others might find it offensive ? `` i do n't know . you have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear , '' he said . `` and we did n't mean it as sexist . '' the organization has since withdrawn the poster , releasing an official apology to `` anyone who might find it intimidating , discriminatory or sexist . '' `` the organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl , '' it added . removing the poster is one thing -- but the uci missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years , said olympic road race champion , nicole cooke . `` telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent , '' added the retired cyclist whose autobiography `` the breakaway '' highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career . `` a whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling . instead , the race has received huge publicity . '' celebrating sexual assault ? the poster also glorifies what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace , said laura bates , founder of the `` everyday sexism project . '' `` it contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault , which should n't be treated as something to celebrate and joke about , '' she added . similarly , belgium 's institute for the equality between men and women , said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and `` incited sexual intimidation . '' it 's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament . `` not only is the poster sexist -- this race does n't even have a women 's field , '' said bertine , who has long campaigned for a women 's edition of the tour de france equal to the men 's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling . `` here we are , fighting these battles to make equality happen . and posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling , '' she said . she sees the problem not with the majority of `` supportive '' male cyclists , but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters . money talks . indeed , sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the women 's tour de france off the ground , said alex russell , one of two females on the board of british cycling . `` a lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it 's not necessarily down to gender , '' she said . `` we 've introduced a women 's tour in britain and we have got financial support for that . but you ca n't just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow incrementally . '' former world road race champion cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport . `` the inspiration for the poster is the 2013 tour de flanders , for which male winner fabian cancellara received $ 20,000 -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- for his efforts . in comparison , when i won this event , i was happy for the team to split the modest $ 1,000 i received amongst the other riders , '' she said . `` the biggest change i would recommend to provide protection , security and credibility for female road riders , would be the introduction of a minimum wage , as there is in place for male riders , '' added cooke . `` cycling can not be allowed to exist outside the laws of society , like some sort of medieval anarchy . '' it seems that rather than a podium girl 's bottom , the one being put under the spotlight at this year 's event , will be the organizers themselves .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- isis ' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an israeli spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda . as isis encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of syria and iraq where it imposes its brutal rule , the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing . the deeply disturbing cases shine a light into the range of ways the militants are using children to further their aims . in august , an australian man who had taken his young family to join isis in syria posted a photo on twitter of his 7-year-old son using both hands to hold up a man 's severed head . `` that 's my boy , '' the father wrote alongside the photo , which was reportedly taken in isis ' syrian stronghold of raqqa . in a video the jihadist group released in january , a boy with long hair wearing a black sweater and military fatigue pants appears to shoot two men in the back of the head . the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol in the air . last month , when isis publicized its immolation of the captive jordanian fighter pilot lt. moath al-kasasbeh , one of its videos showed a young boy watching a public screening of the killing in raqqa and saying that he would `` burn the pilot '' himself if he had the chance . those examples reflect a broader effort to induct children into isis ' campaign of violence . isis has also promoted videos of young boys training as fighters , some of them wearing the militants ' black masks , holding bullets and waving the group 's flags . the jihadist movement has called the boys the `` cubs of the caliphate , '' a reference to the way isis fighters refer to one another as `` lions . '' it has taken over schools with the purpose of indoctrinating children . human rights watch has said that isis and other extremist groups `` have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions . '' the united nations has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training . one 15-year-old boy told cnn in november how he was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol , an ak-47 and a radio to stand guard at an isis base in syria . another boy told cnn last year that isis forced his father to send him to one of its children 's camps in northern syria when he was just 13 . `` for 30 days we woke up and jogged , had breakfast , then learned the quran and the hadith of the prophet . then we took courses on weapons , kalashnikovs and other light military stuff , '' said the boy , who later fled to turkey with his family . some of the militants at the camp were kind , joking and laughing with the younger recruits , he recalled . others made the boys watch hideous things . `` they used to bring young -lsb- kids -rsb- to the camp to lash them , '' said the boy , whose real name was withheld because of fears for his safety . `` when we go to the mosque , they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to -lsb- watch -rsb- heads cut off , lashings or stonings . '' `` we saw a young man who did not fast for ramadan , so they crucified him for three days , and we saw a woman being stoned -lsb- to death -rsb- because she committed adultery , '' he said . syrian activists say that some of the boys indoctrinated and trained at such camps are now being killed on the front lines of battle . cnn is unable to independently verify those claims . the militant group , also known as isil and the islamic state , is aggressively using social media to try to lure more young people to join its ranks . the decision of three british teenage girls to travel to syria last month was a stark example of isis ' ability to attract young westerners . another young british woman who left scotland to join isis in 2013 now appears to write a blog about her life under the extremists ' rule , describing perks and offering reassurances to those who might follow in her footsteps . western officials , though , say that isis is pushing a false narrative of what things are really like in its territory . but officials also admit they 're struggling to counter the relentless wave of propaganda churned out on social media by isis members and supporters . `` there 's no question what we 're combating with isil 's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before , '' u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki told cnn last month .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- formula one star fernando alonso returned to work at mclaren on wednesday following his freak accident in winter testing . the spanish double world champion was ruled out of the opening race in australia by doctors treating him for the effects of a high speed crash . alonso has been training hard for his planned comeback at the malaysian grand prix in nine days ' time and used the mclaren simulator to hone his mental preparations . the cnn-sponsored team announced the news on twitter , showing mclaren sporting director eric boullier and alonso at the team 's headquarters in woking , england . alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his mclaren at the penultimate winter test at barcelona 's circuit de catalunya on february 22 . the 33-year-old watched the melbourne race from his home in dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky . mclaren had explained that alonso 's `` accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time . '' after getting back to race preparation in the simulator , mclaren tweeted that it had been a good day for alonso , `` focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures . '' the media enjoyed a guessing game in australia about just how alonso might have reacted to events in melbourne , where lewis hamilton and his mighty mercedes dominated while alonso 's mclaren teammate jenson button finished in last place . dane kevin magnussen , who was deputizing for the recuperating spaniard , was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid . alonso left ferrari at the end of the 2014 season to rejoin mclaren , which is experiencing teething as it renews technical partnership with japanese engine manufacturer honda for 2015 . in his response on twitter , alonso chose to focus on congratulating spanish rookie carlos sainz , who finished ninth on his toro rosso debut and who was inspired by alonso as he plotted his own racing career . `` congratulations to @carlosainz for the great weekend in australia !! and of course to hamilton and mercedes for the win !! see you in malaysia , '' alonso 's message read . meanwhile , boullier is focused on finding improvements in the car 's pace and performance for the next race on sepang 's sizzling circuit , which is also very physically demanding on the drivers . `` we know we have a mountain to climb as far as performance is concerned , '' the frenchman said in a mclaren statement . `` in two weeks ' time we 'll be racing in sepang -lsb- malaysia -rsb- , where the weather is bound to be extremely hot and humid . `` i 'm not going to be rash enough to predict a form upswing in so short a time frame , but we 'll be working flat out between now and then to make performance and reliability gains in any and every way we can , of that you may be 100 per cent certain .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- for the second time in his career , madison , wisconsin , police officer matt kenny is being investigated for using lethal force . but the cases and their circumstances are different , very different . friday 's death of tony robinson , an unarmed biracial 19-year-old , has made madison the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers . eight years ago , it was a different story . kenny shot and killed a man who pointed a pellet gun at him . he was exonerated of any wrongdoing and received a commendation . the dead man was white . it started as a 911 call . the caller reported a man with a gun on his front porch . what the dispatcher did n't know was the man that ronald brandon was talking about was himself . three officers rushed to the scene , including kenny . they knew they were facing a potentially life-threatening situation . they were unaware that brandon 's ex-wife , susan , was also calling 911 . `` my ex-husband is sitting outside and i think he just called 911 , '' she said . `` he 's got a pellet gun ... he 's drunk . '' as she talked to the dispatcher , the squad cars arrived outside . `` i think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness , '' brandon said . `` i hear the sirens coming . jesus criminy . it 's not a real gun . i think he wants to be taken away . '' the officers never learned that the weapon ronald brandon pointed at them was a pellet gun . the call with that information came 40 seconds before they arrived . kenny shot him dead . investigators ruled the shooting a `` suicide by cop . '' for his handling of the incident , kenny was awarded the medal of valor , the department 's highest honor . last week 's shooting has n't earned commendations . it 's polarized a community . because robinson did not have a weapon , his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police : michael brown in ferguson , missouri . eric garner in staten island , new york . over the weekend , protesters filled streets in madison . on monday , demonstrators packed the wisconsin state capitol . they chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message : `` black lives matter . '' the incident started friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , madison police chief mike koval said . when kenny went to the apartment where the report came from , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , koval said . `` once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , '' koval said . after that , according to the chief , `` the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject . '' kenny has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation . `` it 's a stressful period for him and his family , but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation , '' said james palmer , executive director of the wisconsin professional police association . under wisconsin law , officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the division of criminal investigation . once the division completes its investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , koval said . palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation , but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer . `` the real fear for any officer when he 's being attacked , generally speaking , is that their weapon will be taken away , '' palmer said , `` and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly . '' concern is a word often used by the police chief as the investigation continues . concern for his officer . concern for the community . kenny , 45 , is a 12-year veteran of the madison police department . koval calls him `` a very conscientious dedicated public servant , '' but acknowledges that a second shooting in eight-year 's time is , well , concerning . `` any loss of life is very tragic , '' the chief said . `` twice is concerning for anyone . we are concerned for him and the community . '' and the community is looking for its concerns to be addressed . cnn 's gary tuchman , brian todd , catherine e. shoichet and anneclaire stapleton contributed to this report .

'' brown and rihanna eventually reunited but then broke up again , and he and tran , who bills herself as a model and entrepreneur , resumed seeing each other . on wednesday , brown commented from his instagram account on a racy photo tran posted of herself in a swimsuit while on vacation . the singer advised her to `` continue to be a lady beautiful .

los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- gov. jerry brown unveiled an emergency $ 1 billion spending plan thursday to tackle the state 's historic drought . a staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for california to recover from the emergency . senate president pro tempore kevin de león said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to `` manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure . '' according to the california state water resources control board , the package will specifically accelerate $ 128 million from the governor 's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities . proposition 1 funding , which enacted the water quality , supply , and infrastructure improvement act of 2014 , will funnel $ 272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure . some $ 660 million from prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas . as part of the changes , brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as california enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis . `` this unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up , '' said brown . `` but we have a lot of good policies coming . '' to exacerbate matters , weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources . the sierra nevada snowpack , which californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs , is at a near record low . the march snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the march 3 historical average for the measurement site . the overall water content for the northern sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches , just 16 % of average for the date . central and southern sierra readings were 5.5 inches -lrb- 20 % of average -rrb- and 5 inches -lrb- 22 % of average -rrb- respectively . only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower . `` the drought is n't letting up , so we ca n't let up either , '' assembly speaker toni atkins said . `` this legislation will deliver relief to californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause . since our skies are still clear , our job is too . and making sure we meet emergency needs , prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort . '' brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately . he has recently created a drought task force to expedite the legislation .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- early intervention changes lives . respite care keeps families together . both save states money over time . alas , both -- along with a huge swathe of other vital services -- are under attack by the administration of bruce rauner , the new republican governor of illinois . this is happening for two reasons . first , rauner has a problem . he promised to lower taxes despite a $ 6.2 billion structural budget deficit . unwilling to think about new revenue , all he can do is cut programs . second , rauner 's cuts are taking place against the backdrop of a bigger attack on disability . too many right-wing politicians and pundits see disability as a wedge issue with which they can divide interest groups , pit people who need help against each other and rip apart the core social safety net . meanwhile , they reassure their base , which is filled with individuals who also need help from the state , that only they really deserve benefits . like rauner , other governors are cutting services in the name of austerity . kansas , under sam brownback , has pushed disabled people off medicaid , making services less effective and efficient . scott walker , in wisconsin , has proposed cutting long-term care services in such a way as to limit individual choice of caregivers and service providers , empowering the healthcare industry and not disabled americans . florida has gutted benefits to severely disabled individuals in workers ' compensation cases and eliminated countless positions in the department of health . and that 's all just at the state level . nationally , the new congress began the year with a sustained attack on social security disability insurance , which some analysts see as a way to threaten the whole foundation of social security . last december , house republicans insisted that the able act , a bill intended to help people with disabilities and their caregivers save money , only be offered to those who were disabled before the age of 26 , a limitation aimed at excluding people who become disabled through work , disease , accident or age . now bruce rauner is adding to this troubling pattern . the rauner budget slashes state spending by over $ 4 billion , much of the savings gleaned by eliminating or reducing eligibility for programs based in the department of human services -lrb- dhs -rrb- . each cut will come with costs to families and individuals who need the state 's help most . moreover , many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time . take , for example , early intervention , which provides services to children with developmental delays from birth to age 3 at little cost to the parents -lrb- there are means-tested co-pays -rrb- . at their best , these therapies not only help children with disabilities learn new skills , but also teach parents to better understand their children . right now , a child who is at least 30 % delayed in any category -- for example being at least 30 % less able to use speech than a typical child of their age -- is eligible for services . now , as explained to me by a spokesperson for dhs , the program has to save $ 23 million -lrb- they did not explain how this number was picked -rrb- . the plan is to take every child who is 30-49 % delayed -lrb- about 10,000 children -rrb- , re-test them , and remove eligibility from thousands of those deemed the least deserving until the arbitrary dollar amount is reached . over the long term , this is not only bad for children , but is bad for illinois ' budget . the program is extremely economically efficient . for each dollar spent on programs like early intervention , according to studies by people such as the nobel laureate james heckman and the rand corporation , the state saves at least $ 7 in future services . those savings are , in fact , most likely to be realized most dramatically with precisely the children that dhs is trying to exclude . children with only mild delays can , with early intervention , avoid requiring the more expensive special education services in school when they are older . everyone wins . despite this gregory bassi , acting secretary of dhs , is undeterred . at a recent state senate budget hearing , which i attended , bassi kept saying that the program was too expensive and seemed unable to address the long-term costs of short-term savings . he even , in a revealing moment , said that his own nephew ought to get booted from the program because the nephew 's parents make too much money -lrb- a spokesperson clarified that bassi actually has two nephews in the program , both of whom have benefited from the therapy -rrb- . respite programs , which the rauner budget eliminates entirely , provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities . sometimes , such a program just enables the caregiver to do errands or have some private time , essential to maintaining one 's ability to function in a challenging home environment . the programs also provide emergency backup should the caregiver have a medical problem or some other issue . like early intervention , the program is cost efficient . without respite , families are more likely to disintegrate . in such cases , the person with a disability is likely to end up in a state-run facility . this is both vastly more expensive and , most importantly , generally bad for the institutionalized individual . in fact , the rauner budget is packed with what illinois senate appropriations committee chair heather steans , a democrat , called , `` penny wise , pound foolish '' proposals . throughout , the governor and his administration have found ways to re-write definitions of disability in order to save money . they will likely end up paying more as a result of increased use of emergency rooms , rates of incarceration and homelessness . violent encounters between police and people with disabilities will only become more common . people who now receive aid that allows them to live more independently will end up institutionalized or in nursing homes . not only that , but many of these programs bring in matching funds from the federal government or other sources , and the state is surrendering those dollars as well . so why make these cuts , given their likely long-term costs ? it may be that the rauner administration just does n't care about long-term fiscal health so long as next year 's budget looks good . but i see the rauner attacks on disability-related services as just the latest example of lawmakers trying to re-define disability in a way that saves them money . questions about the fundamental necessity of disability benefits infuse right-wing speech on the issue . thom tillis , the new senator from north carolina , was filmed in 2011 calling republicans to `` divide and conquer '' by separating the sympathetic disabled -- people with conditions like down syndrome and cerebral palsy -- from the unsympathetic -lrb- people he implies are just lazy -rrb- . that 's a rhetoric i see at play regularly , though most lawmakers are too smart to say it out loud . recently , for example , sen. rand paul of kentucky falsely claimed that 50 % of all individuals on disability were `` gaming the system . '' fraud is , in fact , somewhere around 1 % . while defending paul 's claim , a fox news host told a woman that her bipolar disorder was `` something made up . '' i do n't hear that type of explicit hateful language from the rauner administration . everyone i 've talked to is saying that they want to help the most vulnerable . they just have a big budget deficit , so they have no choice but to make these draconian cuts . but there are always choices . rauner is just following the right-wing playbook . rule out making up the shortfall by increasing taxes and thus raising revenue . play different groups of needy against each other . tell the public that only some people really deserve help . divide and conquer .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- democrats who have gleefully watched republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own . as the party works to retake control of the senate in 2016 , democrats are looking at a senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time . it 's a big shift from recent years when republicans , riven by long-standing ideological fault lines , faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries , usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots . memorably , in 2010 and 2012 , the fights were so damaging that republicans failed to pick up winnable senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates . democrats , for the most part , have not had to face the same problem . but that might be changing . while the fields of candidates are still taking shape , a platoon of democrats are mulling senate bids in ohio , florida , maryland , california , pennsylvania and illinois . while many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns , none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help democrats avoid a primary bonanza , and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity . republican primary battles are n't going anywhere in 2016 , and on the presidential level , democrats continue to line up behind hillary clinton as their nominee , without a whiff a serious primary challenge . but there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the senate , where the question is whether democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights , jeopardizing the party 's hopes of regaining control of the the upper chamber . `` the great irony of democrats celebrating fissures amongst republicans in recent years is that historically they 're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the gop , '' said josh holmes , a former top strategist to republican senate leader mitch mcconnell . `` now we 're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their senate chances . '' democrats scoff at the idea , claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a senate win against the many republicans up for re-election next year . of the nine senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the rothenberg & gonzales political report , seven of them are held by republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010 . democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the senate . `` unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable republican senators , there are no todd akins here , and there is n't a single state on the map with a democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state , '' said justin barasky , the democratic senatorial campaign committee 's communications director . akin , of course , was the gop nominee in missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about `` legitimate rape . '' last cycle , barasky said , democrats witnessed hotly contested senate primaries in new jersey , massachusetts and hawaii . all of those fights were in blue states , of course . but none of them resulted in a november loss for democrats . republicans , though , are hoping to breathe life into the narrative , especially with democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of florida and ohio . `` democrats are facing messy primaries in key senate races across the country , and there does n't seem to be any end in sight , '' said andrea bozek , communications director for the national republican senatorial committee . `` the infighting is so bad that it 's not just limited to candidates in key races , but is even playing out between harry reid and the dscc in washington . '' the most crowded lane , for now , appears to be in maryland , where five-term sen. barbara mikulski is retiring . in a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections , the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of democrats in congress eyeing higher office . with the exception of house democratic whip steny hoyer , nearly every democrat in maryland 's eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the senate seat . naacp president benjamin jealous and baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake have also been floated as contenders . despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates , the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party 's play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed rep. chris van hollen for the seat , a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner . the dscc , however , has not picked a side in the race . progressive groups , meanwhile , have championed a known figure from their community : rep. donna edwards , who joined the race last week vowing to protect social security and medicare , `` no ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers . '' that was seen as a poke at van hollen , who said in 2012 he was `` willing to consider '' entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations . but even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities , there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder democratic hopes in maryland , which has n't seen a gop senator since charles mathias in 1987 . and mathias , a civil rights advocate and skeptic of ronald reagan , was one of the most liberal members of the republican party . republicans are also hoping for democratic carnage in ohio , where sen. rob portman is up for re-election . national democrats have endorsed former gov. ted strickland for the nomination , but the news did not force p.g. sittenfeld , an up-and-coming 30-year-old cincinnati city councilman , out of the race . democrats are skeptical that sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against strickland and portman , but if he does , his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73-year old strickland . in an interview , sittenfeld spoke critically of portman , calling him `` a 25-year creature of washington '' who is `` out of touch '' with ohio . but the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about strickland 's age . `` i fit the mold for new leadership , '' sittenfeld told cnn in an interview , careful to note his admiration for strickland and stressing that he is running against portman . `` if you put together 100 people into the senate , would n't you want at least one person from the largest generation in american history , the most technologically savvy generation in american history ? '' sittenfeld asked . `` how can we invest in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles ? '' as in maryland , there appear to be no major early-stage differences between strickland and sittenfeld on the issues , which again suggests that the democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else . with a presidential election on the ballot , increased voter turnout is expected to give democrats a lift in the general election . `` there is an ideological reason for running , but let 's not separate that from a path to victory , '' said nathan gonzales , editor of the gonzales & rothenberg report . `` primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity . democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle , specifically in maryland . the democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because maryland is a democratic state . lots of candidates see paths to victory and think , ` why not me ? why not now ? ' '' and while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines , the contests are not necessarily damaging , gonzales said . `` crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory , '' he said . `` that does n't mean that a party ca n't win . '' brad todd , a republican consultant who worked on several top tier senate races in 2014 , said the primaries might boost democrats . `` some of those primaries will animate elements of their base , including some donors , more than the general elections , '' he said . but todd said the rush of primary activity for democrats does not compare to the pitched tea party-versus-establishment battles that have roiled his party for years . `` i do n't see that happening with democrats as much as it does with republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals , '' he said . `` there 's no such thing as a centrist democrat anymore , so there wo n't be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- during his upcoming speech to congress , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and iran , hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the march 24 deadline for a political agreement . a senior israeli official traveling in netanyahu 's delegation , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the israeli government had `` a good understanding of the agreement we can draw conclusions from . '' `` we know what we know . and believe me , we know a lot of information about this agreement , '' the official told reporters aboard the flight to washington . `` the prime minister is going to congress to explain what they do n't know about this agreement that it is a bad agreement . '' will speech backfire ? the official said congress has `` no understanding '' of the deal shaping up . he described the prime minister 's speech as a `` last chance '' to speak directly to congress before a march 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal . the official would not disclose how the israeli government reportedly had more information on the deal than the u.s. congress , but noted that many of the parties were leaking details of the talks . however , in congressional testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee last week , secretary of state john kerry said , `` anybody running around right now jumping in to say , ` well , we do n't like the deal ' or this or that , does n't know what the deal is . there is no deal yet . and i caution people to wait and see what these negotiations produce . '' the official suggested netanyahu would urge lawmakers in his tuesday address to pressure the obama administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves iran with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line . `` there is no sacred date , '' the official said of the march 24 deadline . `` it can be put off . it is not fixed . they can change it '' the official said that as the march 24 deadline approaches , netanyahu will warn `` be careful of giving up compromises . they are compromises and they are not good . '' obama hinted last week that he did not see the need for any additional extensions , saying the talks have , `` sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified that we 're at the point where they need to make a decision . '' that deadline was agreed to by the five parties and iran , which is why kerry is having marathon meetings with the iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif in geneva beginning again this week . 6 questions about netanyahu 's visit . netanyahu spoke with kerry on the eve of his trip , the official said , adding that despite the fraught political tone of netanyahu 's visit , the united states and israel continue to communicate through intelligence channels . intelligence and national security officials , this official said , met last week with national security adviser susan rice and wendy sherman , the lead u.s. negotiator for the iran talks . `` the objective of israel is to get a better agreement , '' the official said . `` we want a good agreement . we are not against all agreements and the prime minister never said we were .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- italian fashion designer stefano gabbana and elton john are in a war of words on social media , calling for boycotts of each other 's work . the argument stems from comments about in-vitro fertilization in panorama magazine , in which gabbana and longtime collaborator domenico dolce spoke about `` synthetic '' children born from `` rented '' wombs . `` no chemical children : life has a natural course , there are things that should n't be modified , '' the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers . the magazine also promises insights from the designers on `` the importance of relationships within conventional families with very , very traditional values '' in an interview that hit italian newsstands last week . john , who has two children with husband david furnish through ivf , issued a strong repudiation of the statements on sunday and pledged to boycott the dolce & gabbana fashion line . in response , gabbana defended his `` freedom to speak '' and called on fans to boycott john . sir elton appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag #boycottdolcegabbana , which by monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on twitter since john invoked it on sunday . by comparison , gabbana 's #boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on twitter , according to social media search tool topsy . `` how dare you refer to my beautiful children as ` synthetic ' . and shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at ivf - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfill their dream of having children , '' john said sunday on instagram . `` your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions . i shall never wear dolce and gabbana ever again . '' the sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as ricky martin , al roker and courtney love . tennis star martina navratilova tweeted her support for john 's post , saying `` my d&g shirts are going in the bin -- do n't want anyone to wear them . '' parents and ivf advocates also joined the boycott . `` my son is not synthetic . his life was made possible through #ivf & i could n't be more grateful , '' writer and infertility advocate jenn palumbo said in a tweet . the comments from dolce and gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 -lrb- they continued working together after the breakup -rrb- . still , gabbana has dropped hints in interviews of his `` traditional '' views toward family structure . he told an italian publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was `` opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents . '' gabbana was quick to react to this controversy , calling john a `` fascist '' in an instagram comment that was later deleted , according to cnn affiliate tgcom24 . he also sought to discredit reports that they told panorama in this instance they objected to same-sex adoption , even though gabbana took that position in his 2006 interview . by sunday evening , gabbana 's instagram feed was full of screengrabs and reposts from people who supported his right to voice his opinion . `` it 's a shame that you are not allowed to say what you like , '' one person said in a comment on gabbana 's instagram . `` you have every right to say what you want , especially as you were n't disrespectful nor immature like elton was . his comments are unnecessary , cheap and childish . '' gabbana issued a statement saying he and dolce had not intended to judge others . `` we firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it . we talked about our way of seeing reality , but it was never our intention to judge other people 's choices , '' the statement read . dolce also defended his views in statement and said he was not applying them to other people . `` i 'm sicilian and i grew up in a traditional family , made up of a mother , a father and children . i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known . but in my personal experience , family had a different configuration ... i was talking about my personal view , without judging other people 's choices and decisions , '' the statement read . cnn 's alba prifti contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a black hawk helicopter that went down in waters off the florida panhandle three days ago -- killing 11 service members -- had aborted a training mission due to bad weather before it crashed , a military official said friday . on the same day that officials released the names of the seven marines who were aboard , new details emerged friday on the fatal mission at the santa rosa sound near eglin air force base . as officials continue to investigate why the aircraft went down in thick fog tuesday , maj. gen. joseph l. osterman -- commander of u.s. marine corps forces special operations command -lrb- marsoc -rrb- -- told reporters that the black hawk was one of two that had to abort exercises involving water `` insertion and extraction techniques '' before the crash . `` my understanding is ... that they were flying as we normally do -- two aircraft together , '' osterman said . `` as they went in , they encountered bad weather and made the decision to wave off and to abort the training mission . at that point , the one helicopter obviously made it back and determined that the second helicopter was not back with them in that return . '' the crash occurred at night -- hours after the two helicopters had successfully completed the same training exercise in daylight . the black hawk helicopters were training near eglin as heavy fog shrouded the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. tuesday , the military said . `` the fog was moving in and out , '' osterman said . `` i think they had done the pre-assessment before going in , said that everything appeared to be ok , but then -- even in route -- made the decision -lrb- that -rrb- the risk was too high . '' the second helicopter lost communication with the missing aircraft and returned to begin the search operation , osterman said . that operation has transitioned from rescue to recovery , with the military focused on recovering the helicopter , military officials said . searchers found the helicopter at the bottom of the sound , and the bodies of the seven marines and four army national guard members who were aboard . the bodies of at least two national guard members were recovered thursday , and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface , the guard said . the crew members were with 1-244th assault helicopter battalion from hammond , louisiana , according to a statement from the louisiana national guard . osterman said the remains will be taken to dover air force base in delaware for identification and forensic examinations before being turned over to the soldiers ' families for burial . on friday , marsoc , based at camp lejeune , north carolina , identified the seven marines who perished in the crash as capt. stanford h. shaw , iii , 31 , of basking ridge , new jersey ; master sgt. thomas a. saunders , 33 , of williamsburg , virginia ; staff sgt. marcus s. bawol , 26 , of warren , michigan ; staff sgt. trevor p. blaylock , 29 , of lake orion , michigan ; staff sgt. liam a. flynn , 33 , of queens , new york ; staff sgt. kerry m. kemp , 27 , of port washington , wisconsin ; and staff sgt. andrew c. seif , 26 , of holland , michigan . they gave all : profiles of those killed in helicopter crash . the names of the four louisiana national guard members were not released . `` to have such a tremendous group of marines -- obviously the experience that they had , the cohesion and teamwork and everything else that they exhibited -- it definitely hit us all hard by having that many at one time , '' osterman said of the deaths . the cause of the crash is under investigation . mark giuliano , chief of the eglin air force base 's fire department , said a couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise but that `` nobody saw anything because of the dense fog . '' `` people said they heard a loud bang , and that was it , '' giuliano said thursday . the second black hawk -- which , like the first , was assigned to the 1-244th assault helicopter battalion based in hammond , louisiana -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of pensacola . `` whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , '' eglin spokesman andy bourland said earlier this week . giuliano said the fire department , which has a unit on santa rosa island near the crash site , was called to help at about 10 p.m. tuesday , roughly 90 minutes after the crash . the military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage , he said . military officials have said it 's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash . the 11 service members , all men , were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations , said capt. barry morris , a spokesman for the u.s. marines corps special operations command . it involved small boats , and inserting and extracting marines from the water via helicopter . morris would not say which phase of the training the marines were in tuesday night . the initial search was hampered by dense fog , to the point that searchers on boats `` could not see , '' giuliano said . on wednesday morning , after searchers got a sonar hit , a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound , giuliano said . divers then went into the water `` to start retrieving the aircrew , '' giuliano said , without specifying how many bodies were recovered . the helicopter had broken into several pieces in a `` high-impact crash , '' he said . the coast guard has hired a salvage company from mobile , alabama , to take the wreckage from the water , giuliano said . on wednesday , gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said the crash was `` a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat . '' `` we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for . '' osterman said the 2,500 marsoc troops have been deployed to afghanistan and other conflict zones during the last eight years -- earning seven navy crosses , 19 silver stars , 207 bronze stars and 189 purple hearts . `` it is a very tight organization , and many of these marines and sailors associated with marsoc are more senior marines , '' osterman said . `` their families are all very close . in this particular case , they were all from the same team so they were very , very close . and everyone immediately rallied together .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- football is the most widely played sport among french youths . yet , it struggles to attract and retain girls . how can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men ? algeria coach christian gourcuff , who has a coached a number of ligue 1 clubs , notes that for a long time , women 's football `` was a sport totally marginalized . '' stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough , too masculine for girls to play . they were much more likely to compete in basketball , ride horseback , or dance , such as maïmouna coulibaly , whose dance company , les ambianceuses , is internationally recognized -lrb- though overshadowed by her brother , amedy coulibaly , the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the charlie hebdo massacre -rrb- . but change is afoot . since the late 1980s , the french football federation -lrb- fff -rrb- has promoted the sport to women and girls . `` over the past 10 years , there has been a considerable development of the women 's game , '' said gourcuff . former player and ex-paris saint-germain official jean-michel moutier concurred . over the past decade `` girls have significantly increased the level of play , '' he said . `` i am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches . '' the sport 's increased television presence helps significantly , especially broadcasts of the women 's world cup . `` that has changed a bit the image of women 's football , '' gourcuff said , `` notably among young girls . '' farid el alagui , who now plays for scottish club hibernian , noticed a dramatic difference in how women 's football is perceived back home . `` if you look at the french national team , '' he said , `` they 've been really good . '' les bleues are presently third in fifa 's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women 's world cup in canada between june 6 and july 5 . the professional women 's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play . `` there are big clubs like paris saint-germain , '' el alagui said , `` who are very good and the level of play is quite high . '' such examples foster confidence to try to the sport . `` i think a lot of girls want to play football , '' he said . `` they 're just scared . '' however , enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait . at asvcm only seven out of 345 players in the club 's football school are girls , and two more play with the club 's youth teams in competitions . such statistics are mirrored nationally . during the 2013-14 season , there were 50,516 licensed girls in the under-6 to under-20 demographic , as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age . while few in number , the young girls at asvcm -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of paris -- are welcomed and respected , observed catherine ledemé , who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade . `` they are often the ` mascots ' of the team , '' she said . moreover , they excel on the field . the football section 's president marc girard proudly boasted that two of asvcm 's young players are in formation with psg 's women 's team . for ledemé , who week-in and week-out ensures the club 's conviviality , `` football has strong social values . '' she supports girls playing football , regardless of the game 's stereotypes or image , a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes . more is needed , but the continued success of the women 's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake . traditionally at this time of year , a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in england 's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation , and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances . do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire , or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes ? on monday , sunderland 's american owner ellis short elected to twist and fired the club 's uruguayan manager gus poyet , confirmed by a statement on its official website . less than a year ago poyet masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at chelsea and manchester united in order to stave off the threat of demotion . now that task is for someone else as short and sunderland try to protect the cool $ 106m it pocketed last season , with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that 's worth over $ 7.8 billion to the premier league 's 20 clubs . `` it 's inevitable sunderland will have been thinking about money , '' simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told cnn . `` particularly television money , because it now accounts for over 50 % of most , if not all , premier league clubs ' turnover . `` it 'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality , very often it is short term thinking . `` whilst i 'm sure sunderland are mindful of what 's going to happen in 2016 , they 'll be even more mindful of what 's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down . '' the tipping point came saturday when fellow strugglers aston villa fired in four unanswered first-half goals against sunderland , having scored four away goals in its previous 14 premier league matches . some fans streamed out of the stadium of light before halftime while one group tried to storm the home dugout to confront poyet . it left sunderland just one point away from the drop zone and was enough to convince billionaire short to swing the axe , the financial implications no doubt rattling round his mind . even though cardiff city , which finished bottom of the premier league last season , still banked $ 92.1 m for its efforts , the disparity between tiers one and two in england is vast . `` most obviously , the tv revenues from the premier league deal , '' chadwick answered when asked what sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor . `` also attendances tend to diminish rapidly so your two biggest sources of revenue are almost instantaneously undermined . `` i would n't want to put a figure on it but you 're talking tens of millions heading up towards potentially hundreds of millions . '' ironically , aston villa were marshaled to victory on saturday by its new manager tim sherwood , installed in the wake of paul lambert 's sacking in february . villa 's american owner randy lerner , who is in the process of trying to sell the club , decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 epl matches . after saturday 's win , the birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man . according to chadwick , research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all-important impetus , but he argues there are few `` impact managers '' available at present . and he suggests the approach of short and lerner proves american owners still do n't fully understand the dynamic of english football as well as they perhaps should . `` it 's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there 's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and i 'm not sure american owners are in tune with that , '' he said . `` we 've seen it with aston villa -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but i do n't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of english football still . `` so they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of english football clubs . '' chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered premier league in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end . `` in one sense , it 's always been like this , '' he said . `` you go back to the 1980s when liverpool were dominant -- some teams knew they were n't going to be champions . `` i think the television revenues have cemented that position of the dominant teams . `` whilst the premier league would argue it 's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in spain do n't have , even so , such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of manchester united , arsenal and the rest dominating . `` for the likes of the north east clubs sunderland , newcastle and middlesbrough it is great if they can get there , even better if they can stay there .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- eastern europe , here comes the cavalry . the u.s. army says it will soon be sending armored stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six european countries to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent russian actions in the ukraine and crimea that have eastern europe on edge . the move was first reported thursday in the military newspaper stars and stripes . u.s. army europe posted the stripes story on its website on friday . the convoy is `` a highly visible demonstration of u.s , commitment to its nato allies and demonstrating nato 's ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation , '' u.s. army europe spokesman lt. col. craig childs , said in a statement , according to the stripes report . the troops and vehicles involved will be moving from training exercises conducted as part of operation atlantic resolve in estonia , lithuania and poland , the report said . they 'll move through latvia and the czech republic as they make their way to vilseck , germany , about a 40 miles drive from the czech border . the troops involved are from the 3rd squadron , 2nd cavalry regiment , which are based at rose barracks in vilseck , and they will be accompanied by the army 's 12th combat aviation brigade , which will provide aerial reconnaissance , the stripes report said . the move is unusual because long-distance movement of heavy military vehicles such as the 18-ton strykers is usually done by rail . the trek is being called a `` dragoon ride , '' after the unit 's nickname , the dragoons . troops will camp out along the route . `` for those participating in it , dragoon ride is a unique opportunity , '' stripes quoted childs as saying . `` soldiers and their leaders will have numerous opportunities to engage with local communities along the route , deepen their appreciation for the cultural diversity within the alliance and enhance the relationships that are essential to building and maintaining mutual admiration , respect and trust among allied militaries . '' the convoy will be the latest in a series of displays the u.s. and its nato allies have taken under operation atlantic resolve , during which the u.s. `` is demonstrating its continued commitment to collective security through a series of actions designed to reassure nato allies and partners of america 's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region , in light of the russian intervention in ukraine , '' according to the defense department 's website . the displays have come as close to 300 yards from the russian border as u.s. army strykers participated in an independence day celebration in nava , estonia , last month . other recent actions include the air force 's movement of 12 a-10 thunderbolt `` tankbuster '' attack jets to an air base in germany and this month the placing of hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in latvia , where they 'll soon be matched up with 3,000 troops from fort stewart , georgia . tension with russia extends to the air too . adm. william gortney , commander of the north american aerospace defense command , told the senate armed services committee on thursday that `` this past year has marked a notable increase in russian military assertiveness . '' russian heavy bomber aircraft flew more patrols outside russian airspace `` than in any year since the cold war , '' though he did not offer a specific number . there have also been increased russian air patrols across the coastlines of europe .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` hey dude -- can you turn your music down ? '' if anyone says this to you while you 're wearing your earbuds , take note : you are probably endangering your hearing . more than one billion teens and young adults are at risk of losing their hearing , according to who -lrb- that 's the world health organization , not the rock band -rrb- . it 's not just old folks who suffer hearing loss . just by listening to music at what you probably think is a normal level , or hanging out in loud bars , nightclubs and music and sporting events , you can permanently damage your hearing . by analyzing listening habits of 12 - to 35-year-olds in wealthier countries around the world , who found nearly 50 % of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices and about 40 % are exposed to damaging levels of music and noise at entertainment venues . it does n't take much time to damage your hearing at a sports bar or nightclub . according to the who , `` exposure to noise levels of 100 db , which is typical in such venues , is safe for no more than 15 minutes . '' once you lose your hearing , it wo n't come back . rapper plan b and coldplay lead singer chris martin know that all too well . they both suffer from tinnitus , hearing loss that causes a permanent and irritating ringing in the ears , because they did n't protect their hearing . now they 've joined forces with a british hearing loss association to warn others . `` i suffer from tinnitus , '' says plan b on actionhearingloss.org . `` when i first developed it , i thought it was trains rushing by my house as i live near a railway line . it was really loud and an extremely high pitched ringing in my ears . i now have to wear special earplugs when i go to bed to help stop my ears from ringing . '' `` looking after your ears is unfortunately something you do n't think about until there 's a problem , '' says martin . `` i 've had tinnitus for about 10 years , and since i started protecting my ears , it has n't got any worse -lrb- touch wood -rrb- . but i wish i 'd thought about it earlier . '' when it comes to personal listening devices , the level of damage you can cause to your ears is directly correlated to how long you listen and how loud the sound . `` unsafe levels of sounds can be , for example , exposure to in excess of 85db for eight hours or 100db for 15 minutes , '' says who . eighty-five decibels is n't all that loud . according to the palo alto medical foundation , it 's about the level of city traffic that you 'd heard from inside your car . some 360 million of us have already suffered moderate to severe hearing loss , according to the un health agency worldwide . while that number does include factors out of our control , such as aging , genetics , birth defects , infections and disease , about half of all cases were avoidable . that 's why who has launched the make listening safe initiative . part of the campaign is to encourage manufacturers to create audio safety features on devices and then educate consumers on how to use them . who is also calling on governments to create and enforce recreational noise legislation . `` parents , teachers and physicians can educate young people about safe listening , while managers of entertainment venues can respect the safe noise levels set by their respective venues , use sound limiters and offer earplugs and ` chill out ' rooms to patrons , '' says who . in the end , it 's up to each of us to protect our own hearing . the good news is that it 's easy to do . when it comes to your personal audio devices , such as your smartphone : . -- turn the volume down . do n't go above 60 % . -- wear noise canceling earbuds , or better yet , headphones . -- take `` listening breaks '' or only listen for just an hour a day . -- get an app for that . download a smartphone app to help monitor safe listening levels . and the next time you go to a bar , nightclub , sports event or concert , use ear protection . martin does . `` now we always use moulded filter plugs , or in-ear monitors , to try and protect our ears , '' says martin . and his kids never go to a concert without big , noise-canceling headphones .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- schools in new york city have decided to observe two muslim holidays and close schools for them . after all , for decades , kids have gotten christian and jewish holidays off . why not add muslim holidays to the list ? conservative family research council president tony perkins went predictably apoplectic , saying that it was evidence of `` discrimination '' against christians . to perkins , `` family '' apparently does not include `` non-christian families . '' perkins ' position is that kids get easter and christmas off , but we call those holidays `` winter break '' and `` spring break . '' i hate to ally myself with such people , but i sort of agree that mayor bill de blasio 's decision is a bad one . however , not for the reasons expressed by perkins . i simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state . i can not support the government endorsing religion of any kind . there was once a time when most people considered the united states to be a `` christian '' country . however , that notion was never the intent of our founders and is not consistent with a pluralistic and enlightened nation . unfortunately , even recent events have shown us that there are a lot of ignorant americans who still think islam is `` un-american . '' because of that , i support measures that tell muslims that they are our brothers and sisters , too . nobody should feel less welcome or `` american '' on the basis of the religion they practice , or whether they believe in any religion at all . but this is the wrong way . first of all , virtually every recognized religion is practiced in new york city . unfortunately , now only three of them have some kind of `` officially acknowledged '' status . christians , jews and muslims have their holidays off , but what about new york 's other religions ? what about my religion ? march 6 has long been `` the day of the dude , '' and as a dudeist minister , should i not demand respect for my beliefs , by insisting that the school district `` take ` er easy '' on that date every year ? pastafarianism is a recognized religion . pastafarians believe that every friday is a holiday . perhaps it is time for us all to be touched by the noodly appendage of the flying spaghetti monster on a weekly basis . by selecting only three `` approved '' religions for respect , we send the message that we value the beliefs of some over those of others . such a mentality has no place in a secular country -- even if we have a history of recognizing some abrahamic religions ' holidays . because therein lies a theory behind the establishment clause . we do n't rank belief systems here . in lemon v. kurtzman , 403 u.s. 602 -lrb- 1971 -rrb- , the u.s. supreme court gave us a three-part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the establishment clause : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the governmental action must have a secular purpose , -lrb- 2 -rrb- it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- it may not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion . de blasio 's action violates , i think , all three prongs . de blasio should have used this opportunity to change direction , and state that there would be no official religious holidays -- that selecting just the abrahamic vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper . this would send the right message -- that the government is not going to get involved in matters of religion , at all . this is not to say that i disapprove of any `` cultural '' days off , or even simply pragmatic decisions . for example , in some school districts in new york , 60 % of the students were absent on chinese new year . the new york state legislature authorized local districts to call off school that day , as a practical approach to empty chairs . further , it did not improperly send a message that certain religions were valued over others . i see no problem with kids taking religious days off , if their family 's beliefs require them to . schools can accommodate that kind of thing as easily as they can accommodate kids who get stuck home with the flu . i do n't have a problem with even teaching about different religions ; in fact , i support doing so . but what de blasio did here was wrong . montgomery county , maryland , officials handled it the right way ; they removed all mention of religious holidays on their 2015-16 school calendar , including rosh hashana and christmas . those days are simply `` days off '' as far as the government is concerned . myself , i intend to continue to observe the day of the dude every year by takin ' er easy for all you sinners . i do n't expect you to -- and as much as i would like the government to mandate that we all do so every march 6 , that would simply rot the lemon , so to speak .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- if ignorance is bliss , then america must be a pleasure junkie , because we sure are chasing that dragon . the most recent example : a school in new york sought to celebrate `` national foreign language week '' by having the pledge of allegiance read in a different language every day . you get one guess as to what happened when it was arabic day . complaints came in from both jewish parents and people who had lost family in afghanistan , according to the school superintendent . what language do they speak in afghanistan ? not arabic . the main languages are dari and pashto . perhaps this complaint illustrates why we need more education , not less . unfortunately , this was n't an isolated incident . earlier this year in florida , parents were up in arms because a school taught about islam in a history class . and , there are perennial stories about `` americans '' offended by a spanish recitation of the pledge . because of the outcry , pine bush students will now not hear the pledge in italian , spanish , japanese , or french , as planned . that they were deprived of such a pedagogical exercise is bad enough . what is worse is that the school district felt that it had to apologize . the district 's statement was a surrender to ignorance . `` the intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than english still pledge to salute this great country . we sincerely apologize to any students , staff or community members who found this activity disrespectful . '' instead of the pine bush students learning about other languages and cultures , they learned that the `` heckler 's veto '' and phony tales of `` offense '' trump open mindedness and the quest for knowledge . at least they do in modern-day american education . perhaps this is a lesson best learned now , because once they get to college , it will be even worse . our universities were once places where ideas were safe to flourish , and we went to question what we knew . today , they are places where disfavored ideas are all but banned . according to students , dixie state -lrb- utah -rrb- bans posters that `` mock '' anyone , including former president bush . last year , smith college 's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had `` hurt feelings '' when alumna wendy kaminer argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism `` the n-word '' in historical discussions . she believed that using the actual word , in context , was proper -lrb- and it is -rrb- . yes , censorship of ideas and speech is no longer a top-down or parent-driven phenomenon . now students themselves insist on being insulated from anything that might make them question their beliefs . instead of debating an anti-abortion protester , oregon university students preferred to call the campus police -- who briefly took their side . george will was slated to speak at scripps college in a program specifically designed to challenge students ' prevailing views . but , since he challenged the feminist view of sexual assault on campus , scripps pulled his invitation . when i went to college , i enjoyed challenging my beliefs . i still do . i hope that my children constantly do the same . that is how we grow . if we can not tolerate foreign languages , or distasteful ideas , even in an educational setting , what hope do we have ? when we have orthodoxy of thought , the very notion of liberty begins to shrivel up and die . when the cry of `` i 'm offended '' can shut down debate over philosophies , or learning about other cultures , or learning other languages , then what have our educational institutions become ? how much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes untethered from its meaning ? and the very inspiration for this column , a debate over the pledge of allegiance , makes the problem even more glaring . a rote and thought-free-chant of mindless allegiance ca n't even be expressed in a different language ? is america really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims `` fidelità agli stati uniti '' that it means anything less because it is in italian ? perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can . perhaps a good place to start is by doing away with enforced orthodoxy of thought and speech in the first place . perhaps a good place to do that would be by doing away with the pledge of allegiance itself . perhaps if we pledged to uphold the constitution , instead of a piece of cloth , we would be reminded of what really built this nation -- the spirit of the enlightenment . no views are so sacred that they need not be challenged . whether we are talking about learning to say the pledge in japanese , or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs , that is what education is about , not enforced ignorance .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in an unusual turn of events last week , a terror plot suspect 's desire to talk to local media put him at odds with his attorneys and landed a cincinnati television station in federal court . at issue was a taped audio interview with christopher cornell and whether the station could broadcast that interview . cornell is accused of plotting to attack the u.s. capitol . the 20-year-old -- who claims in the interview that he is affiliated with isis -- was arrested on january 14 , months after his social media habits and talk of jihad put him on the fbi 's radar , according to court documents obtained by cnn at the time of his arrest . two days after his arrest , a court order was issued barring public contact with cornell , who is being held at the boone county jail across the river in kentucky . last week , cornell made a collect call to cnn affiliate wxix , said news director kevin roach . that phone call initiated what ended up being an hourlong interview , roach said . cornell 's attorney , richard smith-monahan , argued that wxix was in contempt of court for violating a january order `` directing the detention facility holding the defendant not to permit outside contact by anyone with the defendant without -lsb- defense counsel 's -rsb- express approval . '' cornell spoke with reporter tricia macke . in that interview , he refuses to tell macke how or when he first came in contact with isis , but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill president barack obama , members of congress , as well as an attack on the israeli embassy in washington . `` i would have took my gun , '' he said . `` i would have put it to obama 's head . i would have pulled the trigger . then i would unleash more bullets on the senate and house of representative members . and i would have attacked the israeli embassy and various other buildings full of kafir who want to wage war against us muslims . '' when macke asked him why he would plot such an attack , he said `` obama is an enemy of allah , therefore an enemy of us , of islamic state . '' he said his plan for an attack on the u.s. capitol was retaliation for `` the continued american aggression against our people and the fact that america , specifically president obama , wants to wage war against islamic state . '' cornell told macke he was planning what would have been a `` major attack '' to take place in washington on september 20 , repeatedly referring to himself as a member of isis . `` i 'm with the islamic state , '' he said at one point . `` i have connections with many brothers over there . we 've been corresponding for quite some time now , actually . the fbi finally caught on this past year . '' cornell told macke that he used `` encrypted messaging '' to communicate with isis members . he said they discussed `` how we should wage jihad in america . we should form our own groups and alliances with the islamic state , '' he continued . cornell said he was serious about his plans . `` i 'm very dedicated , '' he told macke . `` like i said , i 'm a muslim . i 'm so dedicated that i risked my life . that should say a whole lot . '' he also warned that there were others like himself . `` we are indeed here in america , '' he said . `` we 're in each and every state . we 're here in ohio . we 're more organized than you think . '' the interview was taped in three 20-minute segments and was recorded by the jail and wxix . roach said the jail 's taping system only allows for 20 minutes of taping at one time , so each time the recording would stop and the phone call ended , cornell called the station back to tell his side of the story . cnn listened to the audio recording . during the 6:30 p.m. newscast on thursday , the station aired a brief clip of the audio recording , previewing a longer story that was to air later that night , in the 10 p.m. newscast . according to mike allen , legal analyst and attorney for wxix , a producer from the station called him about 7:30 thursday evening ; cornell 's attorney had filed a `` show of cause '' order in cincinnati 's federal court and an emergency hearing was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. . during that hearing , the judge continued the case for friday morning and wxix agreed to delay broadcasting the interview until friday , pending a decision . in addition to the contempt of court argument , smith-monahan was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station , an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with cornell , according to court documents . during the hearing , which lasted five hours , a lieutenant at the boone county facility testified that one of cornell 's attorneys had given him a phone . in that testimony the lieutenant stated that he reminded the attorney that giving cornell a phone meant he would be able to call anyone he wanted to , which seemed at odds with the spirit of the january court order . at the end of friday 's hearing , u.s. district judge sandra beckwith ruled that the order prohibiting cornell from contact with the public was vaguely written and the station was not in violation of the order . additionally , the judge ruled it would be unconstitutional for the news station to be barred from broadcasting the interview , according to allen . the judge also stated in court that while cornell has the right to remain silent , he also has the right to freedom of speech . `` at the end of the day , the judge made the right decision , '' allen said . cnn on saturday reached out to smith-monahan , cornell 's defense attorney , but so far has received no response . wxix aired a portion of the interview on friday night , and plans to broadcast more this week . cnn 's vivian kuo contributed to this report .
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- russia 's president shares `` political responsibility '' for the assassination of opposition leader boris nemtsov , the late politician 's daughter said friday in her first tv interview since his death in central moscow last week . zhanna nemtsova , who said she has no faith in the russian investigation into the killing , said she believes his death will only deter other opposition voices , rather than embolden them . `` i can not blame him -lrb- putin -rrb- directly , -lrb- but -rrb- i would say that our authorities , including the president of russia , have political responsibility as the head of state , '' nemtsova told cnn 's matthew chance . nemtsova says she has no evidence about who ordered the murder , but that `` it 's evident that it 's politically motivated . '' nemtsov , 55 , was shot dead last friday night as he walked near the kremlin with his girlfriend . a former deputy prime minister , he was one of putin 's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the government . no one has been arrested , though russia 's federal security service chief has said there are suspects . the kremlin has suggested nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of russia intent on creating political discord , but many nemtsov supporters suspect putin 's administration of involvement . how boris nemtsov 's murder serves notice to vladimir putin 's enemies . putin this week called the killing a `` disgrace '' and a tragedy , and he promised to bring those responsible to justice . but nemtsova , 30 , said she does not believe that will happen . she said investigators have not contacted her and she knows nothing of the case except what is in the media . `` i do n't know where his cellphone and his personal belongings are , so i know only those things which are released or published in the press and nothing else , nothing else , '' she told cnn from germany , where she is staying for a few days . `` as i have already said , i do n't have any faith in this investigation . '' nemtsova said she loved her father `` more than anyone else in my life '' and that the two were very close . `` i think that he died a hero , '' she said . `` he was a very brave man , and he was clever , he was a great thinker and he was a brilliant physicist , '' having published dozens of articles on the subject , she said . he was also an economist and pacifist , she said , who most recently had been critical of the kremlin 's handling of the ukraine crisis . `` i know that some russian officials kept saying that he was not dangerous , but ... in an authoritarian regime , any person who does not agree with politics -- who criticizes the official standpoint -- is dangerous , '' nemtsova said . `` that 's why , i think , if you look at other regimes , like in russia , you will see that all opponents to the official line are in danger , under threat . '' nemtsov was a top official with the republican party of russia-party of people 's freedom , a liberal opposition group . he served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under president boris yeltsin . early in his career , he was governor of nizhniy novgorod , a major economic hub . `` i think that now , russia has crossed the line after this murder , and people will be frightened to express their ideas which contradict ... the official standpoint , '' nemtsova said . cnn 's matthew chance reported from moscow . cnn 's melissa gray reported and wrote from atlanta .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- two former neighbors of justin bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star , claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family , vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-semitic remarks . in the lawsuit jeffrey and suzanne schwartz say bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face after he complained about the pop star driving his ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in calabasas , california . the suit , filed thursday in los angeles superior court , also alleges bieber 's bodyguards dismissed jeffrey schwartz 's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with `` what are you going to do about it , jew boy ? '' the suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial . representatives for bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment thursday afternoon . the lawsuit comes after bieber , 21 , pleaded guilty last july to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a january 9 , 2014 incident in which the schwartzes ' house was pelted with dozens of eggs . bieber agreed to pay $ 80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years ' probation . it 's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol , who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his atv collided with a minivan last august in canada . thursday 's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of `` offensive '' behavior by bieber and members of his entourage from march 2013 to january 2014 . the schwartzes , who lived next door to bieber , claim the harassment escalated after a march 27 , 2013 episode in which bieber spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face and threatened to `` f -- ing kill '' him . the following year , after the egging episode made headlines , the schwartzes say they and their children were subject to `` constant harassment '' by bieber 's entourage , fans and the media . the couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress . bieber sold the calabasas house for $ 7 . 2 million last year to khloe kardashian and has since been renting a $ 60,000-a-month home in beverly hills , according to forbes .
port gibson , mississippi -lrb- cnn -rrb- an african-american man is found hanging from a tree in the mississippi woods with bedsheets around his neck attached to a limb 15 feet above the ground . there 's no chair in sight . his feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground . his hands are not bound . is this a suicide ? or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the south 's history of racial violence re-emerging ? those were the big questions friday , one day after authorities found a man 's body with bedsheets around his neck in port gibson , a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural claiborne county , about 60 miles southwest of jackson , the state capital . evidence collected so far does n't suggest foul play in the death , law enforcement officials said . for that reason , suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death , the officials said . claiborne county sheriff marvin lucas on friday identified the man as otis byrd . even though authorities have confirmed his name , they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how byrd died and who is responsible . `` it could take a week , it could take two weeks , it could take months , '' lucas said . authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused byrd 's death , donald alway , special agent in charge of the fbi office in jackson , said friday afternoon at a press conference . he said 30 agents from the fbi , the mississippi bureau of investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim `` that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of mr. byrd . '' agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a `` storage location '' byrd owned that might yield information , alway said . alway said the fbi is communicating with the family and wo n't comment on rumors circulating about the death . `` the community deserves answers , '' he said . `` the family deserves answers . '' the body was found at 10:21 a.m. thursday , deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house byrd was renting , according to lucas . a skullcap had been pulled over his head , the sheriff said . that house was the last place where byrd had been seen on march 2 , according to the sheriff . he was reported missing a week later , spurring a search . the body was found by staffers from the mississippi department of wildlife , fisheries and parks who were taking part in the search , lucas said . thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found , according to the sheriff . a family member who did not want to be identified said byrd was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing . he went to church , he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino , according to the family member , who described byrd as a `` good , hardworking man . '' byrd had been in prison . he was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman , but was paroled in 2006 , according to the mississippi department of corrections . no one has given any indication publicly whether byrd had enemies . what distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching ? thomas martin , a veteran crime scene investigator and president of crime scene forensics llc , said he knew nothing about the mississippi case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation . injuries to the dead person indicate lynching , he said , because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged . when people are strangled by somebody else , investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck , he said . the direction of the ligature is another indicator , martin said . when people hang themselves , the rope often rides up directly behind the ears , he said . when a person is hanged by other people , the ligature moves differently on the neck , he said . martin said these are general observations and that `` the facts are what make or break the case . '' mississippi naacp chapter president derrick johnson issued a statement calling on `` federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of mr. otis byrd . '' the fbi already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene . the u.s. department of justice civil rights division and u.s. attorney for the southern district of mississippi are also investigating , according to a spokeswoman for the justice department . the mississippi bureau of investigation also is investigating . fbi supervisory special agent jason pack told wapt that `` it 's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner '' of death . `` we do n't know what happened out there , '' pack said . `` we do n't know if it was a suicide , if it was a homicide . that 's why we investigate these types of cases . '' lucas , who is himself african-american , said friday that he 's worried people will jump to the conclusion that byrd was murdered and that race was a factor . `` i do n't want the community to go excited saying it was a white-on-black thing . that 's the worst thing that can happen , is people making it into a race issue , '' lucas said . `` and that 's my biggest fear . and i do n't want that to happen . cnn 's ed lavandera and jason morris reported from mississippi , and cnn 's greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's evan perez , alexandra jaffe and wesley bruer contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- early to bed , and early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy , and ... a criminal ? a sanitation worker in an atlanta suburb already served two weekends in jail -- and faced several more until officials relented monday -- after authorities charged him for doing his job too early in the morning . kevin mcgill , a garbage collector in sandy springs , georgia , had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city 's noise ordinance that states that `` trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. '' he was cited one recent morning after starting work about 5 a.m. mcgill said that when he appeared in court , he was `` stunned '' when he learned he 'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early . `` the solicitor said , ` it 's automatic jail time , ' '' mcgill told cnn affiliate wsb . mcgill said it was the first time he 'd violated the ordinance , but the solicitor `` did n't want to hear nothing i had to say . '' `` i was shocked , '' mcgill told wsb . city spokeswoman sharon kraun said mcgill appeared in court with his employer and agreed to a plea deal , which included a 30-day jail sentence . the court said the sentence could be served on weekends , and kraun confirmed monday that mcgill already spent two weekends behind bars . after news of mcgill 's punishment went viral , the solicitor 's office announced monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence , saying in a statement , `` the actions of the court with regards to mr. mcgill 's sentence for violating the city 's noise laws was disproportionate to a first-time offense . '' `` as such , the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation -lrb- is -rrb- suspended , '' the statement said . chief prosecutor bill riley told wsb that the jail sentence was his idea because , he said , `` fines do n't seem to work . '' `` the only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail , '' mcgill said . still , mcgill said being locked up with `` real criminals '' was hard , and so was being away from his family . `` i just want this to be over with , '' he told wsb before getting word of the `` time served '' adjustment . `` i 'm away from my family , my wife , and she 's got to take care of the two little boys and i have four dogs .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a documentary on the life of late singer amy winehouse will be released in britain on july 3 , just weeks before the fourth anniversary of her death , the film 's production company says . `` amy '' seeks to `` truly capture not just the great artist that she was , but also the funny and loving person that most people did n't get a chance to know , '' the filmmakers said on facebook after announcing the film in 2013 . it will feature `` extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks , '' deadline reported wednesday . no u.s. release date has been set , deadline reported . despite releasing just two albums before her death of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on july 23 , 2011 , the british singer 's smoky voice and songwriting won widespread acclaim and six grammy awards . `` amy '' follows a poorly received biopic , `` fallen star , '' released in 2013 . the film was not authorized by the family and , unlike `` amy , '' featured none of the star 's music . winehouse 's father , mitch winehouse , called that film `` rubbish .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- more than two decades as a judge , prosecutor and defense lawyer could not prepare susan criss for the texas murder trial of millionaire robert durst . the aftermath of the sensational 2003 trial of the scion of a new york real estate empire in many ways upended the life of the 54-year-old galveston county-born lawyer who presided over the case . durst admitted at trial that he killed neighbor morris black in galveston and chopped up the body . there was the awkward encounter with durst in an upscale houston mall in 2005 . durst had already been acquitted after his attorneys argued that he killed black in self-defense . or the time , month 's later , when the severed head of a cat was left near the doorstep of criss ' home . criss said she believes durst was behind it but admits police found no evidence . fearing for her life , criss said she stashed handguns throughout her house in case of a home intrusion . she put away the butcher knives in her kitchen . there was the strange instant message that she said brought fbi agents and surveillance cameras to her home . `` i 've been living with this , '' the former judge said in an interview friday . `` it 's affected me in many , many ways . '' the emotions came rushing back when durst -- the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary series `` the jinx '' -- was charged with first-degree murder this week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , susan berman . durst 's lawyer has denied his client was involved in berman 's death . `` everything he does is totally unexpected , '' she said . durst , 71 , appeared to be preparing for life on the run when fbi agents arrested him in a new orleans hotel on saturday . in his room , agents found more than $ 40,000 in cash , a handgun , marijuana and a neck-to-head latex mask to alter his appearance . he 's being held on drug and weapons charges in louisiana as he awaits extradition to los angeles . the last time durst was accused of murder was in galveston . though he was acquitted in the death of his neighbor , durst later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case . days before christmas 2005 , criss ran into the man whose real estate developer family is among new york 's wealthiest at houston 's the galleria mall . durst , who was on parole at the time , was on his cellphone . he had his head down . `` i was glad because i could get my composure , '' criss recalled . it was the first time criss had seen durst outside court , `` in the free world , '' as she put it . `` i needed to not show any fear , '' she remembered thinking . `` i got my poker face on . '' `` hey , i know you , '' she said durst told her . he appeared startled and dropped his phone . fumbling to pick up the pieces of his phone , durst said , `` you 're judge criss . i did not recognize you without the robe , '' she recalled . `` how are you doing , bob . '' durst told her that he could n't believe she stopped to talk to him . `` i have a job to do but it 's not personal . '' there was small talk about cases durst 's lawyers were working . `` i thought , ` oh my god , how do i get out of this ? how do i exit , ' '' said criss , who then wished durst a happy holiday . durst said he was impressed that she had stopped to chat . `` he seemed genuinely touched , '' criss said . she turned around and walked away . she wanted to look back at him but did n't want to seem concerned . `` i started calling my mom and staff and my friends -- you 're not going to believe who i saw ? they said i should call security . for what ? to tell them he 's shopping . '' the galleria mall was not listed on the places durst could go during his parole , said criss , who was a witness at a subsequent parole hearing . the former judge said police officers told her that durst had also been spotted outside the home where morris black was killed . a secretary in the district attorney 's office saw durst driving behind the galveston courthouse , criss said . a condition of durst 's parole was that he could only visit places where his parole officer permitted him , criss said . his parole was not revoked . when court officials called durst 's lawyer dick deguerin to inquire about his presence near the courthouse , the lawyer said his client was visiting a psychiatrist in the area . deguerin could not be reached friday for comment about what criss said about his client . `` there could be no good reason to come back to these places , '' criss said . she started to become concerned . in `` the jinx , '' durst described the time he spent living in vermont with his first wife , kathleen , running a health food store in the 1970s . in 1982 , kathleen mccormack durst went missing . durst said he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in katonah , new york , and she headed to their manhattan apartment . her family said they believe she 's dead and that durst is to blame . the case has never been solved . durst has denied any involvement in her disappearance . `` it 's a nightmare watching it unfold because you could see that justice is n't going to be done , '' criss said of the durst case and its many tentacles . one day in june 2006 , criss said , that nightmare arrived on a walkway just feet from the doorstep of her home . she blames durst . `` it was part of severed cat and it had been cut right behind the shoulders , '' criss said . `` so it had the head and it had the two front legs . it was a small , pretty little gray cat . it was placed very carefully . it was n't just tossed . it was very neatly laid there . it was perfectly cleaned . this had obviously had been killed somewhere else and brought here . '' the animal 's head was perfectly severed . `` what was the key piece of evidence in our case that was n't there that would have given no doubt whatsoever that this was not self-defense -- the severed head , '' criss said , referring to morris black , whose dismembered body was recovered but not his head . criss thought of the two dachshunds she had at home . she checked and the dogs were fine . `` i was in a panic , '' she recalled . `` i was just distraught . '' the police were contacted . even the galveston police chief arrived at the scene , criss said . a veterinarian determined that the cat had been killed by a person . forensic tests found no dna under the claws . there was no evidence linking durst to the incident . `` they thought i was paranoid and crazy , that i was overreacting , '' criss said . galveston det. rick mccullor said he was part of the investigation but declined to comment further . in an email to the bonnie quiroga , head of the galveston office of justice administration , criss talked about getting blinds for her windows and cameras for the courthouse . she recommended getting the door locks fixed . cnn obtained a copy of the email . `` his message is he knows where i live -lrb- and -rrb- this is what he is capable of , '' she wrote . criss said she thought about evidence at the murder trial . the medical examiner testified that the person who dismembered black knew exactly what tools cut through muscle and bone . then the judge started receiving instant messages from unknown senders . one said , `` did you like your package ? '' criss contacted the fbi , which , she said , for nine months had cameras set up around her home . criss said agents determined the message was sent from london . they found no link to durst . the agent involved in the case did not return requests for comment . criss started carrying a gun . her parents always reminded her to keep her doors locked . `` there was a period of time after that where i not only did carry a gun , i had guns and weapons hidden throughout my home , '' she said . `` what if he breaks in and the gun is at the other end of the house ? people did think i was crazy . '' she hid the butcher knives in her breadbox . `` if something happen , i 'd know where they were , '' she said . `` i lived like that . i believe that somebody really bad came to my home to send a message to me . '' criss ' obsession with the durst case is such that she has been working on a book she wants to title `` descent into madness . '' the final chapter keeps changing . `` every time you think you 've reached the highest level of weirdness , we go again , '' criss said . she knows more than she needs to know about durst and his peculiarities : how he used to prepare for court sessions in the holding cell doing naked jumping jacks . how whenever he 's arrested , officers find guns , drugs and stacks of metamucil . she learned the reason for the last item from listening to 32 hours of durst 's recorded jailhouse phone calls . `` this man , his day , every day of his life , is defined as a success or not a success by how going and doing no. 2 went , '' she said . `` that was a part of the conversations with him ... it had to happen at a certain time of day or his whole day was shot . the court staff used to joke that rearranging the court schedule was going to upset bob 's schedule . '' a few years back , while criss was campaigning for re-election and working the polls , a man approached her . criss said it was a juror from the durst trial , a man who had befriended the defendant , visited him in jail and dined with him at times . he must have seen a media report about the severed cat head . `` it seemed like he 's inappropriately happy to be asking me this question -- ` hey , did anything ever happen about that cat head at your house ? ' '' criss recalled . `` i 'm thinking to myself : you son of a bitch . i lied . i know the police were n't doing anything about it . i said , ` oh yes , the police think they know who did . his demeanor changed and he could n't get away fast enough . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- during the three years that i was serving as a member of tunisia 's constituent assembly , i would frequently walk to work through the gate of the bardo museum so i could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden . the museum , in downtown tunis , serves not only as a physical reminder of tunisia 's roman , jewish , christian and islamic heritage , but is also connected to the tunisian parliament . i used to love these peaceful moments on the way to work . sadly , they will likely never feel quite the same again . on wednesday , that kind of mood was shattered as the museum came under siege . more than two dozen people were killed as gunmen armed with kalashnikovs opened fire , sending men , women and children scrambling through the lion gate to escape . the members of parliament who were evacuated were , ironically , discussing an anti-terror bill in a committee . two of the attackers -- who were killed during the assault -- have been identified , and the security minister on friday indicated the pair had been activated from a sleeper cell , although at the time of writing authorities had yet to announce a link to a specific jihadist group . however , the attack followed the release of videos purportedly from the islamic state of iraq and syria threatening tunisia . meanwhile , individuals associated with the banned tunisian organization ansar al-sharia declared allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . all this has left some wondering if the museum attack marks a shift in strategy for isis . have salafist terrorists moved beyond their usual guerrilla-style operations to suicidal attacks outside iraq and syria ? if they have , then our political leaders -- who have already been vocal about their commitment to combating terrorism , and have been collaborating with turkey to prevent tunisians entering syria -- will need to redouble their efforts . the threat posed by terrorism to tunisian citizens and our guests ca n't be downplayed , much less ignored . however , the reality is that a comprehensive strategy is still wanting , a point made in a recent report published by the tunisian institute for strategic studies , tunisia 's foremost think tank on political , economic and environmental matters . indeed , the institute , which has tracked the upsurge in salafi jihadi recruitment in tunisia based on fieldwork and interviews with tunisian jihadists , has documented how the phenomenon has largely unfolded outside the media 's view . so , how should we respond ? some mps have demanded the immediate passage of a new anti-terror law , and have been dismissive of the need to focus on human rights at a time of crisis . however , wednesday 's attack does n't change the fact that we already have an anti-terror law that applies ; simply passing a new version of a law will not stop a repeat . instead , tunisians should build on the stable institutions we have in place to implement some of the key ideas contained in the institute 's report . for example , rather than rely exclusively on the tunisian security apparatus for short-term gain , we need to better engage the tunisian public in our common struggle against salafi terrorists . part of this means beating the terrorists at the recruitment game . tunisians yearn for a sense that the state recognizes their humanity , dignity and value as individuals , not just as potential voters and taxpayers . with this in mind , it is clear that the tunisian state has done a poor job of `` recruiting '' its citizens into the fold , which has left space for terrorists to make a pitch for young tunisians who feel alienated and who have lost hope . of course , a robust police response is required to contain salafi jihadism . but this must be matched by an equivalent civil response to uproot the problem . that is why as law enforcement fans out across the country to investigate and protect , i hope also to see educators and trained social workers traveling to rural and impoverished areas of tunisia to demonstrate that the state has recovered the kind of humanity that was lost during decades of police-state , authoritarian stagnation . wednesday 's attack was tragic . but to move forward , we must not be tempted to fall back on our past .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a manager at an indiana veterans hospital has been placed on paid administrative leave after sending a `` completely and totally unacceptable '' email apparently mocking mental illness . the email , sent by robin paul , `` in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients , '' roudebush va medical center director tom mattice said in a statement posted on the hospital 's facebook page . paul , a licensed clinical social worker , had been managing the seamless transition integrated care clinic , which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their va benefits , services and programs , to include mental health , according to the veterans of foreign wars . her email , first published by the indy star this week , was sent december 18 to members of her team and shows four photos of an elf in different scenarios . two of the photos have struck a nerve with the veterans and mental illness communities . in one photograph , the elf appears leaning over what looks like a straw and coffee grounds on a paper plate , with a post-it note that says , `` out of xanax - please help ! '' the caption reads , `` self-medicating for mental health issues when a cns would not give him his requested script . '' in another , the elf is hanging from a string of christmas lights . `` caught in the act of suicidal behavior -lrb- trying to hang himself from an electrical cord -rrb- , '' the caption says . john thomas is a veteran of the korean and vietnam wars and serves as a leader at an indianapolis american legion post . he said the email makes him sick and angry . `` i ca n't understand anybody who would do anything like this to us , '' thomas told cnn affiliate wish . hospital leadership was allegedly made aware of the email a couple of months ago , according to the indy star , and had `` administratively addressed '' the incident with paul . but since the story went viral , the roudebush va facebook page has been inundated with commenters calling for paul to be fired . matthew conrad on facebook said , `` robin paul 's continued employment is an insult to every veteran who has served this country . '' mattice announced paul 's leave , and a pending investigation , tuesday evening . but many say it 's not enough . `` firing her would be the first step in showing you are truly committed to the veterans ' health and well-being . action speaks louder than words , '' elizabeth sanchez wrote on facebook . two of the country 's largest veterans organizations have also criticized paul 's actions . `` it is absolutely inexcusable that a va supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face , '' vfw national commander john w. stroud said in a statement . `` the vfw demands she be replaced as program manager . '' the american legion also expressed their discontent , saying they take `` health care for veterans very seriously . '' `` veterans suffering from tbi and ptsd should not be held up to ridicule , '' their statement read . john crimmins was one of a few who came to the hospital 's defense . `` as a veteran who receives care at the rodebush va medical center , i find this apology to be acceptable . we 're all prone to doing stupid things . i 'm sure ms. paul has received a reprimand for her actions . she does n't need to lose her job . now , let 's move on , '' he wrote on the va 's facebook page . mattice , who was not available for comment wednesday , did not elaborate on the investigation into the incident , or why it took so long to move forward with placing paul on leave , but instead asked for forgiveness . `` i ask veterans to accept my apology for this failure , and to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well-being , '' he said . this incident is the latest in what has been a tumultuous year for the veterans affairs department . cnn 's months-long investigation into deaths due to long wait times for veterans at va hospitals led to the resignation of veterans affairs secretary eric shinseki . cnn 's attempts to reach paul were unanswered as of wednesday afternoon .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the recent controversy over a video showing university of oklahoma students , who also were members of the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity , reciting a racist chant revealed a key difference in approaches to parenting . the university said levi pettit and parker rice encouraged their brothers to sing the lyrics , which included multiple references to the `` n-word '' and mention of lynching . the two young men were expelled . and the fraternity was shut down . what caught my attention was the reaction of the families -- the pettits and the rices . they could n't have been more different . that convinced me that this story was n't just about racist and juvenile behavior , but also about parenting . who raised these kids ? and should n't they have been taught better ? at some point , did n't it occur to these young men that they were not only shaming themselves , but also their families ? in dallas , protesters gathered outside the rice home , holding signs with messages such as : `` racism is taught . '' parker rice issued a statement , which was delivered to the dallas morning news by his father , bob rice . in it , parker apologized for actions that he called `` wrong and reckless . '' however , bob rice had no response to the controversy . he told reporters : `` at the moment , we are not doing interviews . '' that is not good enough . parenthood is n't like politics . it does n't come with a `` no comment '' button we can press when the job gets uncomfortable . we have n't heard from levi pettit . his parents , brody and susan , addressed their son 's misbehavior in a statement , which was given to the newspaper and posted on the family 's website . it read in part : . `` as parents of levi , we love him and care for him deeply . he made a horrible mistake , and will live with the consequences forever . however , we also know the depth of our son 's character . he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting . while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist . ... `` of course , we are sad for our son -- but more importantly , we apologize to the community he has hurt . we would also like to apologize to the entire african-american community , university of oklahoma student body and administration . our family has the responsibility to apologize , and also to seek forgiveness and reconciliation . '' that 's an impressive statement . i applaud the pettits for stepping up and refusing to blindly defend their son , as many parents might have done . they did what parents are supposed to do : they took responsibility for the actions of the person they raised . who knew that would be so controversial ? ever since the apologies were offered , there 's been discussions in this country about whether it 's really necessary for parents to apologize for the actions of their grown children . last week , while hosting a radio show in san diego , i brought up the story of the video and pointed to the different approaches that the rices and the pettits have to parenting -- all the way from `` we are not doing interviews '' to `` our family has the responsibility to apologize . '' the pettits had the right idea , i insisted . a caller disagreed , saying he did n't see why he should have to apologize if his adult son did something wrong . `` he 's his own person , '' he said . based on what i 've heard in the last few days , i would imagine that there are many people who agree with the caller . they seem to believe that , when their son or daughter turns 18 , their job is finished . they ca n't wait to wash their hands of any additional responsibility , and they might even frame their retreat as a way of advancing the principle that everyone should take responsibility for his own actions . that sounds good . but i do n't think it 's either/or . of course , individuals should take responsibility for their actions . yet , as the pettits demonstrated with their statement , when something goes terribly wrong , there is usually enough responsibility to go around . when appropriate , parents can take a slice . besides , i bet a lot of parents believe -- as i do -- that we should never stop loving our children . but at some point , it 's perfectly fine for us to just stop claiming them as our own ? it just looks like some parents ca n't wait to find the exit . here 's an idea . we tell people to drink responsibly . we tell them to drive responsibly . we need to start telling them to parent responsibly . after all , parenting a child is the most important job that many of us will have in this world . and there is no date of retirement .
montabaur , germany -lrb- cnn -rrb- co-pilot andreas lubitz 's voice is n't heard in a recording of the final moments of germanwings flight 9525 . but investigators say he was the one at the controls inside the cockpit , deliberately locking out the plane 's captain and setting the plane on a crash course for the french alps . andreas lubitz had medical note for day of crash , hid illness , officials say . the only sound the recorder picked up from lubitz as the airbus a320 went down , marseille prosecutor brice robin said , was the co-pilot 's steady breathing . authorities did n't mince words thursday as they blamed lubitz for the crash , but questions are still swirling over the 27-year-old 's past . officials say lubitz passed a psychological test when he was hired , had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight . it seems , robin said , that lubitz `` wanted to destroy the aircraft . '' but why ? lufthansa ceo ` speechless ' it 's a question police were trying to answer as they searched lubitz 's apartment in dusseldorf . police spokesman markus niesczery said a team of five investigators went `` through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down . '' about 85 miles -lrb- 136 km -rrb- away in the town of montabaur , the house where lubitz 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police . a group of men , perhaps investigators , were the only ones granted access . this town in western germany is where lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age . at a club on the outskirts of montabaur , pilots who knew lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said . they said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane . between the ages of 14 and 20 , lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club . '' -lrb- he was -rrb- a very normal young person , full of energy , '' klaus radke said . `` what can i say ? he had a bright future . he made his hobby into his job . what more can you hope to achieve ? '' the authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for peter ruecker , another pilot who knew him from the flight club . `` knowing andreas , this is just inconceivable for me , '' ruecker told the reuters news agency . `` he was a lot of fun , even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet , '' ruecker said . `` he was just another boy , like so many others here . '' a neighbor told reuters that lubitz `` was very interested in things which are going on around him . '' `` it 's a very good family , '' the neighbor said . `` they have a good connection within the family and they are engaged in the community . '' an 8-minute descent to death . lubitz had been with germanwings , a budget airline owned by lufthansa , since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the airline 's media office said . lufthansa ceo carsten spohr told reporters that lubitz `` interrupted '' his training , which he began in 2008 . that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon . spohr said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training . if it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , he said , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation . most of lubitz 's training took place at the lufthansa flight training center in bremen . he also trained in the united states , spending six months at facility in arizona as part of a required program to get his license , a lufthansa spokesperson said . spohr said lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying . however , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said . lubitz and the captain passed a psychological test when they were hired , he said . `` we do n't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , '' spohr said . `` he was 100 % set to fly without restrictions , '' he added . `` his flight performance was perfect . there was nothing to worry about .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- when i received an advance copy of a book called `` moody bitches '' last month , i was immediately intrigued . i have been called moody , and the `` b '' word , but never have both terms been used -- at once -- to describe me . -lrb- at least not that i know of ! -rrb- . had i been labeled a moody `` b '' in the past , i certainly would have taken it as a major insult . but today , if someone called me that , i think i would say , `` thank you for describing who i am and who we , women , are . there is nothing wrong with being moody , emotional or irritable . '' that provocative title , `` moody bitches : the truth about the drugs you 're taking , the sleep you 're missing , the sex you 're not having and what 's really making you crazy , '' got me thinking about whether our emotionality , our monthly ups and downs during our menstrual cycle , should be viewed as such a negative after all . opinion : are drugs stifling women ? `` women have this idea that we are supposed to not be moody and we 're supposed to tamp down that moodiness , '' said julie holland , author of `` moody bitches '' and a psychiatrist who has practiced in new york for 20 years . `` it 's like a problem to be fixed and really , i think it 's our greatest asset . it 's certainly our greatest psychological asset . '' after all , our empathetic nature helps us understand nonverbal babies -- and not-always-the-most-communicative husbands and partners . our intuition helps us sense people 's motivations . our emotions help us realize when something is wrong in our lives . so , why on earth have all of those qualities come to be viewed as a source of weakness , not strength ? and why is at least one in four american women taking some form of psychiatric medication , including antidepressants , versus one in seven men , according to holland ? some of these women definitely should be taking antidepressants and other medications , but the question is why are so many other women taking them when they do n't need to be ? this is you on stress ? those were just some of the many questions a group of us chatted about over coffee recently : holland , cnn legal analyst sunny hostin , cosmopolitan executive editor leslie yazel and me . yazel , a mom of a 4-year-old , wondered if people are afraid of being unhappy . `` i do think that people are afraid to be sad and they 're afraid to be scared , '' holland said . `` i think we spend a lot of time and energy pushing down emotions that are uncomfortable for us . i do n't want to cry right now . i do n't want to be angry . i do n't want to be scared so we push it down , but the problem with pushing it down is it takes a lot of energy and it ends up creating a lot of tension . '' social media , with the endless barrage of gorgeous-looking pictures from family and friends who appear to be having the most perfect lives , certainly does n't help . in fact , a recent study showed that heavy facebook users experience envy , which could lead to extreme sadness and depression . `` everyone 's instagraming their best , most fabulous , freakin ' pictures , and they 're looking so skinny and beautiful and so happy , and they 're going on vacation ... and then you compare it to your life , '' said hostin , a mom of two . it 's not a real or genuine life , holland said . `` it 's plastic . '' but when more and more women medicate away their emotions when they do n't need to be taking antidepressants or any other psychiatric drugs , they create a `` new normal , '' she said . postpartum depression : one mom 's mission becomes a movement . `` it 's like doping and biking , or steroids and baseball . if everybody is doing it , then the ones who do n't are at a disadvantage , '' said holland , who is also the author of the best-selling memoir `` weekends at bellevue . '' `` if everyone is getting boob jobs , then people who do n't end up feeling flat-chested . '' and when it seems more normal than not to be on mental health meds , the bar is lowered for when women will go on antidepressants , she said . women who are medicating away their emotions when they do n't need to be might not realize there are major effects to their decision . notably , they find it more difficult to cry -- and tougher to orgasm . `` i certainly talk to my patients about sexual side effects . it comes up all the time . in our first meeting , i ask ... ` is it hard for you to climax because this may end up being an issue ? it 's going to be even harder ' ... but it 's not like it 's in the advertising , '' holland said . `` it may be in the small print on the back of the ad , or they may say it at lightning speed during the tv commercial . '' women today are subjected to a barrage of advertising -- from daytime talk shows to women 's magazines -- about the medications they could take to make them feel better . women 's desire for sex is complicated , not strictly hormonal , study says . `` twenty years ago , when i started my practice , i had somebody come to me and they would have symptoms , but they did n't quite know what was wrong and what they needed . and now people come to me and it 's like , ` well can you explain the difference between effexor and wellbutrin , and can you tell me which one i should take ? ' '' the conversation `` advanced from ` is there something wrong with me ? do i need medicine ? ' to ` which medicine is right for me ? ' '' said holland , who points to how nine out of 10 of the big pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than on research and development . what we 're also seeing , holland said , is a growing belief by women in the workplace that they need the meds to control their emotions at the office . she tells the story of a woman who called her up in tears and said she needed new antidepressants because clearly her current meds were n't preventing her from crying at work . when holland asked her what caused her to cry , she said her boss was being difficult . holland said what was needed was a plan to confront her boss , not a prescription for a new medication . `` i hate to see us medicating away our sensitivity and emotionality for the comfort of other people in the workplace . i think it 's a big mistake . '' thinking about trying to control our emotionality for the comfort of others reminded me of a college relationship , which i shared with hostin , yazel and holland . my boyfriend at the time told me one of my problems -lrb- he clearly thought i had many ! -rrb- was that my highs were too high and my lows were too low . he said i needed to live in the middle . `` you should be more like me , like a man , '' joked holland . clearly , that relationship did n't last very long ! as we wrapped up , i asked the women what the biggest takeaway was for them following our conversation about holland 's thoughtful new book . `` do n't give up your awesome orgasms , '' said yazel . -lrb- amen to that ! -rrb- . `` so it 's ok to be a moody ` b ' ? ' '' hostin asked . `` it 's ok to be a moody ` b , ' '' holland replied . `` our sensitivity and our emotionality is an asset . it 's not a liability . it 's not a symptom that needs to be medicated away . '' how concerned are you that so many women who do n't necessarily need antidepressants are taking them ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- he does n't wear a uniform or hold an official rank , but hadi al-amari is a powerful military leader in iraq . he leads the hashd al-shaabi , a predominantly shia paramilitary force doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit from isis extremists . ousting isis from tikrit is important for dozens of countries in the united states-led coalition trying to thwart the islamist extremist group 's quest to grow its caliphate . iran is n't a part of this coalition , but it is also working to defeat isis -- something that 's provoked both relief and alarm in washington . al-amari is confident his men , with help from the iraqi army and some sunnis , can crush isis in iraq without this coalition 's help . he 's sure because the iranians are advising them . `` we do n't need it , and we wo n't need it , '' he said . `` anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate iraq is putting their faith on a mirage . '' iran knows what it 's doing , in his view . `` yes , we declare to the world , we have iranian advisers , and we 're proud of them , and we thank them deeply for participating with us because iran has more experience than anyone else on earth in fighting terrorism . '' does it matter that iran is advising militias fighting isis ? does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against isis -- including that one of them , iran , is a longstanding u.s. foe ? when asked questions along those lines wednesday in washington , it seemed that even top u.s. military officials did n't have easy answers . the view is that defeating isis is good , while relying on and possibly strengthening iran is not . in other words , iran 's involvement in iraq is a mixed blessing . to make sense of this all , one needs to understand not only the international landscape and iraqi politics , but islam itself . the religion 's two major sects are sunni and shia . in iraq , sunni arabs comprise 15 % to 20 % of iraq 's population , with about half of them in urban areas like baghdad , mosul and tikrit , according to the council on foreign relations . about 18 % of iraq 's population is sunni kurds . that means the vast majority of iraqis are shiite muslims . and it matters . during his decades-long rule , saddam hussein -- a sunni whose hometown is tikrit -- gave positions of power to sunnis , and marginalized shiites , experts say . many shiite families fled to iran and the country gave them housing and jobs and schooled their children . that imbued iraqi shiites who have returned home with a fierce allegiance to iran . shias have led iraq since hussein 's ouster , often alienating sunnis in the process . this has fueled major sectarian rifts that peaked when nuri al-maliki was prime minister , leading to not only millions of disaffected citizens but a weaker central government and military that isis frequently overran in 2013 and 2014 . haider al-abadi took over as prime minister last year in part to address these deep divisions . still , some sunnis have n't seen the change they want : for instance , sheikh naim al-gaoud in february called for direct u.s. arming of sunni tribes like his or at least pressure to make iraq 's government help them more in the fight for anbar province . and shiite militias sometimes have done more to hurt than help the cause of unity . the advocacy group human rights watch has documented what it calls escalating `` abuses by militias allied with iraqi security forces in sunni areas , '' pointing to instances in which residents have been forced from their homes , kidnapped and executed . such treatment has happened in remote areas as well as the iraqi capital , according to the group . `` sunnis are a minority in baghdad , but they 're the majority in our morgue , '' an iraqi health ministry doctor told human rights watch last july . just a few days ago , iraq 's most powerful shiite cleric grand ayatollah ali al-sistani said people `` must always act with self-control , '' according to the new york times . still , there 's hardly a guarantee such calls for restraint will be answered , especially amid the chaos of war . the fear is that mostly shia militias , like the one led by al-amari , will inflame the tinderbox of sectarian strife -- with human rights watch warning of revenge attacks on sunnis in tikrit . add to this equation the fact that isis is made up sunni muslims who consider shias heretics and apostates , slaughtering them in large numbers . civilians and troops alike have faced their wrath : the most glaring incident may have been last june , when the militant group overran an iraqi military base once known as camp speicher -- which , notably , is near tikrit -- and claimed to kill some 1,600 air force cadets , the vast majority of them shias . given these harsh realities , it 's not necessarily cut and dried what a sunni citizen in tikrit will think if either shia militias or the shia-led iraqi military battle the sunni group isis . `` do i choose the iraqi military -lrb- which is working with the u.s.-led coalition -rrb- or isis ? do i choose leukemia or the plague ? ... which groups do they dislike more ? '' said stephen biddle , a strategy expert and the award-winning author of `` military power : explaining victory and defeat in modern battle . '' `` it 's not like the sunnis love isis ; most do n't . but some think the shiite government is a bigger threat than isis . '' so what should the united states do ? jessica stern , a lecturer on terrorism at harvard university who this month published , `` isis : the state of terror , '' says it 's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in iraq and continue pushing for changes in its government . she notes that `` the anti-sunni , shia-promoting government of maliki '' was a big reason isis was able `` to take root '' in iraq . `` many sunnis feel under siege . isis is saying , ` we 're going to protect you . isis is presenting itself as a savior of sunnis , '' she said . but , as biddle points out , reform in a bureaucracy comes slow . there 's been talk for years about healing iraq 's sectarian divide . what 's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon ? biddle thinks the u.s. should consider sweetening the carrots offered to the iraqis as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together . the biggest stick would be pulling out of the fight against isis . `` right now we seem to be limping along with whatever they do , '' he said . `` we 're not offering them many goodies to do what we want and not making them feel like they 're going to suffer much either if they do n't do what we want . '' enter iran . it 's part of this quandary because it shares a border with iraq , has its own interest in fending off isis , and is predominantly shia . it 's also a staunch foe of the united states , which its leaders have cast as the `` great satan . '' that lack of love is mutual , with washington leading a years-long standoff with tehran over its nuclear program . -lrb- there are ongoing talks aimed at resolving that impasse , but critically no deal yet . -rrb- . yet isis is likewise america 's enemy , with president barack obama saying that the goal is to `` degrade and ultimately destroy '' that group . it 's not in iran 's interest to have iraq devolve into a sectarian war , says retired u.s. air force lt. col. rick francona , a cnn military analyst . `` the iranians are smart enough to know that 's a possibility , so they would be telling the shia-led militias not to make this a sunni v. shia fight , '' francona said . but what should the united states think about iran 's efforts to defeat isis by backing shia-led militias ? speaking at a congressional hearing wednesday about the white house 's request for use of force to fight isis , the chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff opined that iran 's involvement in helping iraqi forces is a good thing . `` anything anyone does to counter isis is in the main a good outcome , '' gen. martin dempsey said . defense secretary ashton carter suggested that the matter was more nuanced . the u.s. is worried about iran 's role , he said . `` it is something that is concerning to us , '' he said of iran 's role , `` in particular because the sectarian danger in iraq is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against isis .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world is watching for what could turn out to be either a historic achievement for international diplomacy -- or , just as easily , a disappointing failure -- as negotiators sit down this week in the tranquil lakeside city of lausanne , switzerland , to hammer out a framework nuclear deal with iran before march 31 . here are some of the key things you need to know as the next major deadline approaches in the iran nuclear talks : . 1 . the road to lausanne has been a long one . this latest round of talks are part of a process that has been going on for two years , through both public and private diplomatic channels . in 2013 , tensions between the world powers and iran began to thaw a bit after the election of reformist iranian president hassan rouhani , who pledged to end the crippling weight of international sanctions on iran 's economy . in november of that year , officials from the five permanent member nations of the u.n. security council -- the united states , united kingdom , france , russia and china -- along with germany , began nuclear negotiations with iranian officials in switzerland and signed what came to be known as the geneva agreement or joint plan of action , offering limited sanctions relief for iran in return for that country rolling back aspects of its nuclear program . the deal was heralded as an interim step toward a larger , more comprehensive agreement , which would further lessen the economic pressure on iran and give the six world powers -- referred to collectively as the p5 +1 -- certain assurances that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful in nature , as it claims . several rounds of talks have taken place since the joint plan of action was reached in an effort to bring about that comprehensive agreement . but this interim agreement has been extended twice over a failure of the parties to meet previous deadlines for a final deal . 2 . there 's no guarantee they 'll reach a deal . while both sides stand to gain from a potential agreement , they also have certain `` red lines '' they are n't willing to cross -- key issues that could sink the prospects of a deal even if everything else is agreed to . for iran , a major sticking point is the pace of sanctions relief . they want the international community to lift all u.n. sanctions at the beginning of the agreement , whereas the p5 +1 powers would rather see those sanctions phased out as iran demonstrates its commitment to the deal . iran also wants a high cap on the number of centrifuges and other nuclear hardware it can continue to operate , and for the restrictions imposed on it in the deal to last only a short period of time . this platform is diametrically opposed to the p5 +1 position : that iran should maintain a relatively small nuclear infrastructure and that the moratorium on iran 's nuclear activities should last at least a decade . and of critical importance , particularly to the united states , is the insistence that iran be held to a minimum one-year `` breakout time '' -- a technical terms reflecting the amount of time it would take for iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it decides to walk away from the agreement . so even as negotiators express some optimism about the progression of talks , it 's clear that there are major gaps to bridge , which may be why some u.s. officials have put the odds of reaching a deal at 50 % or less . 3 . even if there 's a deal , it 's not the deal . while the focus this week is on the march 31 deadline , it 's important to note it is n't the final deadline . the parties are seeking to reach what 's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal . but if they 're able to come together on the big issues , they still have until the end of june when the joint plan of action expires to iron out the details . so that means the talks wo n't be finished this month . officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders . the united states would prefer a written accord , but iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached . 4 . there are a lot of stakeholders . there are seven countries at the negotiating table , but far more following along from the outside . israel , for instance , as one of iran 's primary geopolitical foes in the middle east , is watching the talks keenly . israeli officials are regularly consulting with their p5 +1 allies on a regular basis and are trying to influence the outcome of the deal . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has been one of the most vocal critics of the negotiation process , publicly butting heads with the obama administration in an effort to derail the talks . saudi arabia 's government is equally concerned about the prospects of a deal , fearing it could give iran greater leverage in the region . and there are those who fear that a nuclear agreement will spur other countries in the region to develop nuclear programs -- a means of deterring iran if it decides to restart the military dimensions of its newly legitimized nuclear program . but there are also stakeholders in the international community that would welcome the opportunity to trade freely with iran once sanctions are eased , giving them access to vast iranian markets . 5 . domestic politics matter . aside from netanyahu , many of iran 's most ardent detractors are in the u.s. congress and in iran , and they will continue to make their views known . the chairman of the influential senate foreign relations committee , sen. bob corker , r-tennessee , is introducing legislation that would compel the administration to put any deal it reaches to a vote in congress , something that the administration adamantly opposes . administration officials say congress has already been consulted throughout the negotiating process , and that , at the end of any final agreement -lrb- potentially a decade from now -rrb- , will play a role in repealing u.s. unilateral sanctions . but congress is not satisfied to take a back seat in these talks -- a fact that was demonstrated this month when 47 republican senators signed a letter to the supreme leader of iran , suggesting a future president can easily retract any agreement the obama administration signs . in iran , supreme leader ayatollah khamenei has the final say on any nuclear agreement iran would reach with world powers . and he is mindful of hard-line clerics in iran who are opposed to a deal with the west that imposes restrictions on what they see as iran 's right to a nuclear program . khamenei has sent mixed messages about the negotiations . he has voiced support for the efforts of rouhani and foreign minister javad zarif , the lead negotiator . but he has continually voiced distrust for the united states and has dismissed the idea that a nuclear deal would lead to cooperation in other areas . the internal struggle between power centers in both the united states and iran is a key variable that could derail the already complicated negotiation process .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- whoever wins the general election on may 7 will face international challenges reaching to the heart of a question that has bedevilled every london government since 1945 : what is , or should be , britain 's role in the world ? as one of world war ii 's victor countries , britain helped shape the post-war international architecture . notably , it gained a permanent seat , plus veto power , in the u.n. security council , which it retains to this day . but these battlefield laurels disguised fundamental weakness . the two world wars severely depleted britain 's human and material resources . the heyday of the world 's largest-ever empire and of london and liverpool 's control of a vast maritime trading network had passed . as the cold war took global grip , the united states purposefully pushed britain aside . the u.s. took over its military bases , its spheres of influence , and its markets . conscious of its decline , london clung , slightly pathetically , to what it termed its `` special relationship '' with washington . maintaining this key u.s. relationship is the most important foreign policy challenge facing britain 's prime minister after may 7 . whether that person is the conservative party 's david cameron or the opposition labour party 's ed miliband makes no difference . barack obama 's arrival in the white house now looks like a watershed for bilateral relations . unlike many of his post-war predecessors , obama was no anglophile . indeed , his grandfather 's unhappy experience in colonial-era kenya gave him reason to dislike the english . obama the dispassionate analyst also found scant objective reason to prioritize the british alliance or europe generally . looking at the eu , he saw one dominant , friendly power -- and its capital was berlin , not london . looking the other way , to asia , obama saw opportunities and threats of far greater moment , centered on rising powers such as china and india -- hence his subsequent `` tilt '' to asia . britain 's principal value to the u.s. lies with its defense capabilities . it proved a loyal if not especially effective ally in afghanistan and iraq . although capacity has steadily declined in the past 30 years , britain was seventh in the world in 2013 in terms of military spending and remains a dependable u.s. deputy within nato . but the pre-election consensus is that the next british government will be obliged to slash defense spending again , probably below the 2 % of gdp threshold to which nato members are pledged to maintain . big cuts in army and air force numbers are in prospect . maintaining even one modern aircraft carrier has become a real struggle . it is likely , on these trends , that britain would be unable to contribute separately to any new international campaign , but would be obliged to place its troops under u.s. command , as general raymond odierno , u.s. army chief of staff , recently suggested . america 's top politicians , soldiers and diplomats , such as u.n. ambassador samantha power , are applying increasing pressure on britain over defense expenditure , but with little joy so far . in time , this impasse could lead to a permanent rift . worse still , in the u.s. view , is the possibility that a labour-led government , potentially beholden to the unilateral nuclear disarmers of the scottish national party , could slacken its commitment to trident , the uk 's nuclear missile submarine fleet . the snp says the country can no longer afford a nuclear deterrent , morally or financially . washington 's worries about britain 's role have been exacerbated by the lack of fight , as some see it , displayed by london when faced with the prospect of scottish independence and the inevitable break-up of the united kingdom . similar concerns apply to britain 's eu membership , which cameron has placed in doubt by promising a national referendum by 2017 . the u.s. greatly values britain as an informal , surrogate voice within the eu . but washington 's interests aside , the eu is britain 's biggest trading partner and a natural ally in terms of democratic values , and legal , social and cultural norms . an exit from the eu would satisfy minority hardline nationalists in the uk independence party . but it would seriously undermine britain 's standing in the world , in relation to europe and to the emerging brics powers . all this matters more than ever because , amid the developing disorder of the post-cold war world , old certainties are being uprooted and new or revived threats are multiplying . the aggressive behavior of vladimir putin 's russia is one obvious example . another is the rise of international terrorism , most recently in the form of isis , also known as the islamic state . another is china 's hegemonic ambitions in the east china and south china seas , at the expense of neighbors such as japan , the philippines and vietnam . on these issues , it seems that britain , by design or not , has little concrete to contribute . london allowed germany and france to take the lead on ukraine diplomacy . embarrassed by public criticism , cameron belatedly sent a few army advisers to help train kiev 's forces . similarly , london 's military contribution to the fight against isis has been minimal , and confined to iraq . members of parliament recently expressed strong dismay that britain was doing so little . and as for japan , ostensibly an important british ally , recent defense cooperation agreements do not disguise the likely infeasibility of sharp-end assistance . indeed , as some see it , there is far too much british kow-towing to china . disturbed by this evidence of decline , britain 's political class comforts itself by arguing the country still leads by example . it still maintains a generous overseas aid budget , it mounts successful humanitarian missions such as in sierra leone during the ebola outbreak , it remains a top five world economic power , and sometimes -lrb- though not always -rrb- it uses its u.n. and other platforms to stand up for democratic values and human rights . all this is true . but it is small consolation for a country that , 100 years ago , was a superpower with truly global reach . in the election campaign , foreign policy and the key 21st century international issues , such as climate change , have barely got a mention so far . this is not an accident . britain 's horizons are narrowing . its strength and global ambitions are fading . its post-imperial destiny is that of a second-tier power . the trick is not to appear second rate .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's been more than 13 years since 2,753 people were reported missing in lower manhattan after the attacks on the world trade center . although death certificates have been issued for all 2,753 , the work to identify each victim continues . in fact , it 's far from over : some 40 % of the victims have not yet been identified , according to the city 's office of chief medical examiner . the most recent identified victim is matthew yarnell , a 26-year-old new jersey native who worked for fiduciary trust on the 97th floor of the south tower . yarnell 's mother said friday that the news `` was a bit of a shock , '' but that it means that she can `` finally put everything to rest . '' `` it kind of opened up all of the old wounds and old pains initially , '' michele yarnell told cnn 's brooke baldwin . `` i guess it kind of put to rest any -- i would n't say doubt -- -lrb- because -rrb- we were n't doubtful about the outcome , but it kind of gave us closure . '' according to the medical examiner , yarnell 's dna samples were recovered during the original recovery effort from 2001 to 2002 . until this week , they resided with other remains that have not been identified . a recent retesting , however , yielded a new result . `` every time there 's a new development in a dna processing or technique , they go back and they recheck every single remain that they have in the repository at the museum , '' she told baldwin . `` and this time -lrb- matthew 's -rrb- matched . '' the identification of yarnell puts the total number of identifications from the world trade center at 1,640 , meaning there are still 1,113 more to go . daunting , but not insurmountable . `` the me 's office is not going to give up , '' michelle yarnell said . `` i hope for everyone that lost a loved one there , that they 'll have that closure someday , and , hopefully , sooner rather than later .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton held a closed door meeting with president barack obama at the white house on monday . although the former secretary of state , senator and first lady has not declared , it is treated as a foregone conclusion that clinton is running for president . likely to launch her campaign in april , clinton is regarded as the front-runner -- if not the only democratic candidate -- and the inevitable democratic nominee . there is an assumption that since clinton supported obama , the black community will now embrace her . but there are more than a few who did n't get that memo . at this stage of the game , many african-americans may not be excited about a candidate hillary clinton in 2016 . and after two terms of the nation 's first black president , she should proceed with caution . clinton need look no further than the 2008 contest , when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects . early on , clinton was the favorite of black folks , lest you forgot , and it did not hurt that president clinton had been regarded as the `` first black president '' with high approval among african-americans . then , support for a senator named barack obama blew up after the iowa caucuses . and clinton found herself apologizing for her husband 's comments about obama 's win in the south carolina primary . president clinton was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared obama 's win in the palmetto state to that of jesse jackson in 2004 and 2008 , suggesting that obama , like jackson , would not win . the misstep was an affront to many african-americans , as were hillary clinton 's suggestions on the campaign trail that obama was only good for making speeches , but not for taking action . and let 's not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for `` hard-working americans , white americans . '' we can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited campaign-trail junk-talking , and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election . president obama made clinton his secretary of state , and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the obama cabinet . but that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter , racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago . black voters are among the most loyal of the democratic party base , and their record high turnout for obama was an important part of his victory . however , with a charismatic obama no longer on the ballot , maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge . thegrio.com : blacks are treated 72 % as well as whites . moreover , as for clinton , who -lrb- understandably ? -rrb- has her own ideas and may not agree with the president on certain issues , any criticism of obama could cost her some black voters . remember that clinton voted in favor of the unpopular , costly and deadly iraq war . that support cost clinton in 2008 . and while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , clinton 's strongly pro-israel stance on mideast peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the democratic base , including blacks , latinos and young voters . however , it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to hillary clinton as economics . because she is tied to the wall street wing of her party and commands sky-high speaking fees , people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class , and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy . the nation is hurting , despite the economic turnaround , and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks , who still have high unemployment rates , a rising wealth gap compared to whites , and , for many , no recovery in sight . and while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community , clinton has remained relatively quiet on the subject . she will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement . this , rather than her email account , is what concerns the black electorate . thegrio.com : let 's stop the ` struggle equation ' perhaps a populist , more down-to-earth challenger such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren or former virginia sen. jim webb could appeal to black and working-class voters , and unlike clinton , would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble , or lacking core beliefs other than being in power . it is safe to assume that if clinton wins the democratic nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election , but that may not be enough . let 's remember president george w. bush won re-election in 2004 with just 11 % of the black vote . had mitt romney been able to duplicate that number of black votes , he would be president now . obama won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012 , particularly in swing states like ohio . clinton ca n't assume she 'll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm . support for barack obama does not necessarily translate into support for another democrat . this means clinton must fight for votes like anyone else : knock on doors , kiss babies , clap off beat at the ame church , and do whatever it takes .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there is a controversy brewing about starbucks and its new `` race together '' campaign . the ubiquitous coffee shop company was mocked for its decision to have its employees write the words `` race together '' on its coffee cups and start a discussion on race . but what 's so bad about that ? should n't we commend starbucks for trying to be good corporate citizen , to walk the talk , as it were ? starbucks ceo howard schultz announced the company 's new campaign this week , which he described as `` an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society . '' in other words , grab a cup of coffee and let 's talk about race . `` we have problems in this country with regard to race and racial inequality , '' schultz said in a video to corporate employees . `` we believe we 're better than this , and we believe the country is better than this . there is a need for compassion , empathy and love towards others . '' and he has indicated that the new move is not mandatory for its employees . this is what schultz calls `` conscious capitalism . '' it is an example of businesses who want to serve the community , get ahead of the curve rather than pander to what they think customers want , and show that they care about something other than getting paid . thegrio.com : creflo dollar is further proof that prosperity gospel is full of ` false profits ' of course , we would be foolish to think that starbucks or any company would engage in such a strategy separate and apart from a profit motive . after all , the company , like any other money making enterprise , wants to make more money . and capitalism is all about making money . and yet , there are different pathways to getting there , and maybe starbucks is showing us a new way . perhaps you think that their approach is corny , and yes , the company has faced a lot of attacks online for their stance . but the attacks are distracting us from a very important problem , one which many people would rather not discuss , with or without their coffee . clearly some people do want to talk about race , and there is a desperate need to confront the issue head on . what we are witnessing as a society is a new movement led by black women and spurred by the killing of black people such as michael brown and trayvon martin , renisha mcbride and eric garner , john crawford and tamir rice , and many more , whether by police or by armed vigilantes . thegrio.com : blacks are treated 72 percent as well as whites . people of all colors and persuasions have participated in #blacklivesmatter , #icantbreathe and #handsupdontshoot protests and die-ins across the nation . race is part of the town hall , the public square . it always has been , but what is different now is that the issue is once again being placed on the front burner . it only makes sense that actors and players in society , including corporations such as starbucks , would want to become part of that new dynamic . at a time when so many corporations are coming under fire for their questionable , exploitative , even deadly business practices , starbucks is trying to be a responsible corporate citizen and part of the solution . corporate america makes a great deal of money , and just as some corporations have benefited historically from slave labor and exploitation , some corporations today attempt to get ahead by cutting corners , underpaying their workers with poverty wages , cheating their customers with bad mortgages or polluting the environment . meanwhile , other companies take a completely different approach and realize that by giving back to the community , supporting worthwhile causes , and initiating important discussions not only helps their bottom line , but improves society 's bottom line . of course , we can not pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve america 's problems , just as president obama 's `` beer summit '' over the racial profiling of harvard professor henry louis gates fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those `` teachable moments . '' thegrio.com : let 's stop the ` struggle equation ' race in the united states is not merely about who likes or who does n't like you , or who calls you the n-word or does not want to live next to you . racism is a system of power dynamics and institutions that must be made to change . but these institutions are made of people , and people do have to talk . and drink coffee . and who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race ? maybe they will even think about things in a different way . so , let 's not attack starbucks for doing the right thing and getting the ball rolling on race . the only thing worthy of criticism is that other companies have n't done it , and that 's something that needs to change . more : what starbucks ' #racetogether campaign missed .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- muhammadu buhari has ruled nigeria before , as one of a line of military strongmen who dominated the country between 1966 and 1999 . a military coup brought buhari to power in late 1983 -- closing a brief period of popular rule by shehu shagari -- and another military coup ousted him from power in august 1985 . buhari 's 20-month rule was known for what he described as a `` war on indiscipline , '' a tough regime which some say was marred by human rights abuses . the 72-year-old retired major general 's experience as a military ruler has been viewed as a plus by some and a minus by others in present-day nigeria , where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group boko haram . this year alone , the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians , human rights watch says . the ongoing violence in the northeast has put security -- along with corruption and the economy -- at the top of the election agenda . prior to this year 's polls in march , ayo johnson , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on african affairs , told cnn that voters would opt for whoever could make nigeria feel safe . `` many nigerians will not forget -lrb- buhari -rrb- was a military leader , during a dictatorship , '' johnson said . `` or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism . '' buhari has campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime , while stressing that nigeria 's security needs to be the next government 's focus . `` it 's a question of security . whether i was a former military officer or a politician through and through , when there is insecurity of this scale in the country , that takes the priority , '' he said from his campaign plane . in another interview with amanpour in february , buhari blamed president goodluck jonathan 's government for repeated setbacks in the fight against extremists . `` the misappropriation of resources provided by the government for weapons means the nigerian military is unable to beat boko haram , '' he said . asked by amanpour about abuses allegedly committed during his own previous leadership , buhari said there was `` a degree of accuracy '' in the claims . but he said he had ruled nigeria as part of a military administration . `` when that military administration came under my leadership , we suspended -- as a military then -- part of that constitution that we felt would be difficult for us to operate and as also a consensus , '' he said . `` i think i 'm being judged harshly as an individual that what happened during a military administration can be extended under a multiparty democratic system . '' buhari 's campaign was fiercely anti-corruption . he ran under the slogan of `` new broom , '' and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote . the 2015 presidential race was buhari 's fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985 . in 2003 , buhari -- then with the all nigeria people 's party -- lost to olusegun obasanjo in an election during which eu observers reported widespread irregularities . he lost again to umaru yar ` adua in the 2007 election , which was widely condemned for rampant vote-rigging , violence , theft of ballot boxes and intimidation . after yar ` adua 's death in 2010 , jonathan rose from vice president to president and buhari challenged him in the 2011 elections as a candidate from the congress for progressive change . buhari had helped found the party a year earlier , saying it was `` a solution to the debilitating , ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party , the anpp . '' buhari is a muslim from nigeria 's poorer north , while jonathan hails from a christian and animist south that is rich with oil . after jonathan 's victory in 2011 , amid accusations of vote-rigging , violent riots broke out in the north . armed protesters took to the streets chanting buhari 's name , and more than 800 people were killed in the post-election violence . buhari 's office issued a statement calling reports of burning of places of worship places a `` sad , unfortunate and totally unwarranted development . '' `` i must say that this is a dastardly act -lrb- that -rrb- is not initiated by any of our supporters and therefore can not be supported by our party , '' said buhari 's spokesman yinka odumakin . `` i must emphasize that this is purely a political matter , and it should not in any way be turned into an ethnic , religious or regional one . '' read more : nigeria election -- what you need to know . ahead of this year 's election , jonathan and buhari signed a nonviolence pact , the abuja accord , in january . on march 26 they renewed their pledge and reiterated their commitment to `` free , fair and credible elections . '' but violent protests broke out a day before the final results were announced . protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in nigeria 's oil-rich rivers state as they marched to protest the elections , amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation . both candidates called for calm , with buhari , who contested this year 's vote as part of the all progressives congress , tweeting : `` fellow nigerians , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced . '' after the protests in rivers , his party demanded the elections there be canceled . but nigeria 's electoral commission decided the results would stand , saying it `` did not believe the allegations were substantial enough to require the cancellation/rescheduling '' of the rivers poll . according to his campaign website , buhari is from daura in nigeria 's northern katsina state and is married with eight children . his military training began in 1963 and included stints in the united kingdom , india and the united states . buhari was the first chairman of the nigerian petroleum corporation , the site says . elements of buhari 's biography were questioned in the run-up to the march 28 election . after weeks of speculation and an ongoing legal battle over allegations that buhari failed to complete his secondary school education , a nigerian court on march 25 cleared the way for him to run in the presidential race after adjourning the case until april 22 . as a sunni muslim from the north , buhari appears to have moved to address any concerns his appointment could be detrimental to non-muslim nigerians -- approximately half the country 's population , according to the cia factbook . a blog post on his campaign website headed `` buhari will never islamise nigeria '' describes a campaign ceremony in january in imo state . imo gov. rochas okorocha , it says , `` dismissed suggestions of plans by muhammadu buhari to ` islamize ' nigeria , '' telling the audience buhari 's long-time cook and driver were christians and his youngest daughter had married a christian . buhari has also not been immune to the violence plaguing northern nigeria . last year , he was targeted in a suicide bombing that killed at least 15 people in the city of kaduna . an earlier blast in the city the same day had been aimed at a muslim cleric . a day after winning the country 's presidency , buhari told cnn 's christiane amanpour that fighting corruption and curbing violence were at the top of his agenda . the economy is another major issue the new leader has to contend with , as the country overtook south africa last year as the continent 's largest economy . but as many as 70 % of nigerians live below the poverty line , surviving on less than a dollar a day .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- vladimir putin lies . blatantly . publicly . and , apparently , without chagrin . but a year since the annexation of crimea , what does that mean for the west 's ability to deal with him regarding ukraine ? in february 2014 , `` little green men '' -- the ukrainian term for professional soldiers wearing russian combat fatigues but no identifying insignia -- seized key installations and checkpoints around crimea . the russian president 's website reported the following exchange at a march 4 , 2014 , news conference : . question : `` the people who were blocking the ukrainian army units in crimea were wearing uniforms that strongly resembled the russian army uniform . were those russian soldiers , russian military ? '' vladimir putin : `` why do n't you take a look at the post-soviet states ? there are many uniforms there that are similar . you can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform . '' question : `` but were they russian soldiers or not ? '' vladimir putin : `` those were local self-defense units . '' within weeks , putin admitted they were russian troops . at the same news conference , putin said he saw no possibility of crimea joining russia and said moscow would do nothing to `` provoke '' that . two weeks later , he presided as the russian parliament passed legislation annexing crimea . in a documentary shown on russian television last sunday , putin said he gave the order to take crimea on february 23 , 2014 . so , it is clear that putin can and does lie . but with that in mind , how should western leaders who must deal with him actually do so ? first of all , they should bear in mind ronald reagan 's `` trust but verify '' dictum . second , while putin may play fast and loose with the truth , he appears to be a rational actor who calculates costs and benefits . the challenge for the west is to structure agreements so that it remains in his interest to observe them . take the 2010 new strategic arms reduction treaty , which limits u.s. and russian strategic forces to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads on 700 deployed missiles and bombers . the agreement requires data exchanges , notifications and on-site inspections . the russians might be able to cheat a little , but not in a way that would give them a militarily significant edge without the united states having time to react . and the kremlin has incentives to observe the treaty . if russia violated it , the united states could relatively quickly add 1,000 strategic nuclear warheads to its deployed ballistic missile force . the u.s. government concluded last summer that russia violated a 1987 treaty by testing a banned intermediate-range ground-launched cruise missile . as far as is publicly known , moscow has not taken the more serious step of deploying the missile . washington now seeks to persuade russia to come back into full compliance and has threatened a variety of costs , including possible military countermeasures -- on top of the opprobrium of russia 's european and asian neighbors , who would be targeted by such a missile . -lrb- it could reach little , if any , of the united states . -rrb- the costs of noncompliance for moscow could be significant . the question now topping the agenda is whether the west can trust any russian promises regarding a settlement to the conflict in eastern ukraine . sadly , the track record offers little encouragement . russia effectively did nothing to implement the first minsk ceasefire , which was agreed to last september . it did not withdraw its military equipment or secure the ukraine-russia border . the minsk ii ceasefire reached in february fared little better at the outset . a kremlin spokesman dismissed the idea that russia was a party to the agreement -- even though russia 's ambassador signed it . russian forces backed those of the separatists attacking the ukrainian town of debaltseve in the first days after the ceasefire supposedly had begun . -lrb- putin 's continual denials that russian troops are in eastern ukraine have zero credibility after the crimea case . -rrb- . since then , the ceasefire seems to have taken better hold , though it remains fragile at best . at the same time , concern has grown that the port city of mariupol could be the next separatist/russian target . what can the west do to stabilize the ceasefire ? an assault on mariupol -lrb- or elsewhere in eastern ukraine -rrb- would probably trigger severe costs in the form of a new round of western economic sanctions on russia and the provision to ukraine of greater military assistance , including defensive arms . as hans binnendijk and john herbst recently suggested in the new york times , the united states and european union should tell the russians now what costs would be imposed if there is an assault on mariupol , in order to help deter such an attack . the west may not be able to trust putin on the ceasefire in eastern ukraine . but it can do more to raise the potential costs and affect his calculation , and hopefully dissuade him from further military action that would probably bring down the entire minsk ii agreement .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- fifa president sepp blatter has told iran to end its `` intolerable '' ban on women attending football matches . writing in the fifa weekly magazine published by world football 's governing body , blatter described the situation as one that `` can not continue . '' iran 's ban was put in the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their team without restriction . at the match against iraq , activists unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british-iranian woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against brazil in 2014 , and called for the ban to end . the measure was imposed following the 1979 islamic revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-islamic . iran is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the asian tournament , for which the united arab emirates is also bidding . but the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event . blatter wrote : `` i raised the topic at my meeting with the president of iran , hassan rouhani , and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term . `` however , nothing has happened . a collective stadium ban still applies to women in iran , despite the existence of a thriving women 's football organization . `` this can not continue . hence my appeal to the iranian authorities -- open the nation 's football stadiums to women . '' during last year 's football world cup , cnn reported how fans in iran gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings . at one coffee shop in the capital , tehran , the tense game against argentina -- a game iran lost only to an injury-time lionel messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd . `` 100 percent it 's better this way , '' said negar valayi . `` it does n't happen often . it would be great if we have more of this . '' `` it 's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited , '' said roya marzbahan . hoardings advertising the world cup throughout tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women . and state tv broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored . blatter also hit out at football 's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body 's executive committee . the committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the fifa congress following a change to the statutes in 2011 . `` this was hard work because the members of fifa 's executive committee are elected by the national associations ... and there was never , never a proposal for a woman to be finally in fifa , '' the 78-year-old said at an event in switzerland . `` we had to take the decision , and i did it in 2011 at the end of the congress , -lsb- that -rsb- we must have at least one woman on the executive committee . '' he described football as a `` macho '' sport and warned : `` we should change in the future . ''

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- updates on scott walker , marco rubio and john kasich , an economic twist on the old adage `` all politics is local , '' and an overseas vote where president obama would love to see an anti-incumbent backlash -- those stories filled our sunday trip around the `` inside politics '' table . the official white house line will be something like this : the israeli people are making their choice , the united states admires their vibrant democracy and looks forward to a close friendship and strategic partnership with the next israeli government no matter who wins . but it 's no secret president obama is no fan of benjamin netanyahu , and the israeli prime minister 's recent address to a joint meeting of the congress exposed the rawness of the relationship . so as the votes are counted and the coalitions debated in the week ahead , the white house has both a personal and professional interest . npr 's steve inskeep took a firsthand look at the israeli campaign in the final days and offered his take on the uncertainty . `` now , israel 's political system is so complicated that even if -lrb- netanyahu 's -rrb- party ends up not being the leading party , there are scenarios where he could end up in a governing coalition , '' said inskeep . `` but it 's interesting to note that isaac herzog , the labor party leader , who 's his biggest challenger , wants to change israel 's approach to the world -- has been talking about trying to end israel 's isolation in the world , which would suggest changing a lot of policies that have infuriated this white house or frustrated this white house over the last several years . '' wisconsin gov. scott walker and former florida gov. jeb bush tend to be at the top of gop presidential polls these days , and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry . but maggie haberman of the new york times took us inside some recent big-money conversations during which walker took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival . walker was in new york city last week for fund-raising meet and greets , and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him . new york observer owner jared kushner was also on hand . `` he was asked how he would beat jeb bush , and he surprised a bunch of people by saying jeb bush is the front-runner , '' said haberman . `` now , that 's contrary to a lot of other things he said publicly last week . '' `` but that is his sell to people who could give him money , which is : ` no , no , -lrb- bush -rrb- is the front-runner but i 'm the slow and steady guy who 's going to come up behind , just like when i ran track when i was younger . ' '' sen. marco rubio of florida at times appears to be the odd man out in the early gop presidential rankings . jeb bush 's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for rubio to tap florida 's deep fund-raising well . then came the scott walker boomlet , and talk among some conservatives that the wisconsin governor -- not rubio -- might be the best pick for a new generation gop standard-bearer . but rubio has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar , and robert costa of the washington post shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party 's 2012 nominee , mitt romney . `` he 's spoken with romney twice since romney decided not to get in the race , '' said costa . `` and he has had meetings this week with people like lanhee chen , romney 's former policy director , and texts often with spencer zwick , romney 's former finance director . '' `` i think rubio , if he nurtures those relationships , we 'll see him continue to rise in the donor community and with consultants and voters . '' ohio gov. john kasich is about to make his first new hampshire foray of the 2016 cycle and is getting some encouragement from important players in the first-in-the-nation primary state . kasich , who is exploring running but has n't been as aggressive as many other gopers in terms of travel and staff recruitment , will be in new hampshire on march 24 for the politics and eggs breakfast , a rite of presidential passage sponsored by the new hampshire institute of politics . word from people familiar with the trip is that kasich is being encouraged to be more active in new hampshire by former gov. john h. sununu and his son , former gop sen. john sununu . two new hampshire gop activists also report that former gop sen. judd gregg also believes kasich -- like gregg , a budget hawk during his time in congress -- would be a strong addition to the gop field . there is a crowded field of republicans testing the waters for 2016 -- and the people of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina are grateful . they do n't have as much reason to be grateful to the democrats , who so far seem to be fixated on a single candidate . the lack of a big field will likely spare hillary clinton a damaging mess , as california gov. jerry brown suggested last week . but , party loyalties aside , perhaps he would have a different take if his state were near the top of the nominating calendar . julie pace of the associated press reminded us the early presidential attention is an economic engine in those early states . `` when you have robust primaries in both parties , you have tons of money flooding into iowa and new hampshire , south carolina , on television ads , on hotels , transportation , campaign headquarters , '' said pace . `` and there is some concern that on the democratic side , we 're just simply not going to see that this time around . '' `` and it 's a reminder that politics has become such a big business beyond just the campaigns and the super pacs . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- one of 10 people killed in the collision of two helicopters in argentina , france 's florence arthaud has been described as a `` national treasure '' by fellow sailor shirley robertson . `` florence held the hearts of her nation when she won the route de rhum in 1990 -- a crazy sprint across the atlantic , alone in very fast boats , an event watched live across the country with millions coming to see their heroes set off , '' mainsail presenter robertson told cnn . along with camille muffat and alexis vastine , the 57-year-old arthaud was one of three sports stars killed in the collision as two helicopters transported the athletes to a gorge in northwestern argentina to film the reality tv show `` dropped '' for french broadcaster tf1 . according to robertson , arthaud had inspired a generation of french sailors . `` brave and brilliant , nothing was impossible , '' added robertson of arthaud . `` a true role model to the yachtswomen who would follow , she led the way . `` her sense of adventure continued and she was well known for her tv documentaries bringing the power and passion of the sea into the living rooms of her adoring public . the nation will mourn this heroine 's loss . '' known as the `` little girl of the atlantic , '' arthaud was the daughter of jacques arthaud , the director of the arthaud publishing house . `` a true character , she made her mark in the sport through her determination and showed to the whole world that sailing was not merely a sport for men ; that women could now also take part in the adventure and succeed , '' said the french sailing federation in a statement on its website . despite being left in a coma after a car accident at the age of 17 , arthaud crossed the atlantic for the first time when she was 19 , going on to win a number of races including the 1997 transpacific race that traverses the pacific ocean . the boat that she had sailed to win the route du rhum -- pierre 1er -- also helped her establish a women 's singlehanded west to east transatlantic record , as arthaud notched a time of nine days 22 hours and five minutes . `` her death has moved the french sailing world , '' added the french sailing federation . `` all our thoughts are with her family and her loved ones .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- two extremists who attacked a landmark museum in tunisia , killing 23 people , got weapons training at camps in libya , an official said friday . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , security minister rafik chelly said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . `` they left the country illegally last december for libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster alhiwar ettounsi tv . like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring . but unlike its neighbor to the west , libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by islamist militants , like those behind the 2012 benghazi attack that killed u.s. ambassador chris stevens and three other americans . such violence has been rare in tunisia , at least on the scale of what happened wednesday at the bardo museum in tunis . still , it is not a total shock , given that up to 3,000 tunisians have left to fight as jihadists in iraq and syria , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london , not to mention others who have joined radical groups closer to home . already , authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from tunisian president beji caid essebsi . and in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for the attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and apostates '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators . the nation 's security forces are working to break up other cells like those behind the recent bardo museum attack . but that 's not necessarily going to be fast or easy . `` we know they can launch operations , but we must piece together clues in order to conduct an arrest , '' chelly said . as investigators continued their work , tunisians turned out friday to mark the north african nation 's independence from france . those commemorations were more somber this year , but they were also in many ways more significant . `` i 'm here to celebrate 59 years of our independence , '' said adib adela , 38 , a school inspector in tunis . `` the most important thing now is to properly investigate and to find those responsible . '' tunisia has been shaken by the terrorist attack , though it was foreigners -- 19 of them tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis -- who made up the vast majority of victims . fifteen victims ' bodies are at a morgue in the capital , a forensic official said . some of them have n't been identified two days after the attack , according to the official , and all are foreigners . the fear is that many other tourists wo n't come back . already , the parent companies of the two ships that had most of the victims , costa cruises and msc cruises , have announced the cancellation of all scheduled stops in tunis for 2015 and substituted them with other ports . that means some foreigners wo n't be coming to tunisia as once expected . but it does n't mean all tourists will stay away -- as illustrated by a movement online of people vowing , `` i will come to tunisia . '' beyond tourism , tunisians also hope to get support from other countries as they fight terrorism . `` i hope other countries will support tunisia , like they supported france after charlie hebdo , '' said amir foudieli , 33 , who works for an export company , referring to the january massacre at the satirical magazine 's offices in paris . `` we are tunisian , this is our country . not theirs , they -lrb- the terrorists -rrb- are bastards of children . we have centuries of history . '' cnn 's hamdi alkhshali , victor blackwell and journalist yasmine ryan contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- madonna , saying something controversial ? perish the thought . the object of her scorn fighting back ? of course . the mayor of rochester , michigan , has written an open letter to the venerable pop star , taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school . `` i ca n't be around basic , provincial-thinking people , '' she told howard stern last week on his siriusxm satellite radio program . you could almost hear the steam coming out of mayor bryan barnett 's ears . `` it 's like someone calling one of your kids ugly , '' the detroit free press quoted barnett as saying . `` you 're not going to let that go by without a response . '' in his letter , published monday in the free press , barnett said the city 's recent achievements are anything but provincial . `` our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two blue ribbon schools , the most in michigan . our universities are among the fastest growing in the midwest and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity , '' he wrote . buying madonna 's house : a tale of fame and misfortune . `` we design and build more robots than any other city in north america , and rochester hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents , nearly one a day , over the last three years . not a typical achievement you would associate with ` simple or basic ' people , '' he wrote . he also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by money magazine . `` we are many things , madonna , but basic and provincial minded we are not ! '' barnett wrote . `` i invite you back to rochester hills to see who we are and what we believe in . while we certainly do n't need your stamp of approval , i am quite confident we would earn it . '' not surprisingly , some rochester hills citizens were n't thrilled with madonna 's comments . `` makes me proud to live in rochester hills after reading this letter to madonna by @mayorbarnett , '' twitter user loganbrown97 wrote . and although madonna has n't responded to the fracas , she of course found some defenders on social media . `` why is everyone mad madonna said rochester was basic ? '' twitter user itsleah wrote . `` it is basic . i thought that was the appeal ? small towns are n't for everyone , dummies . '' of course , madonna is no stranger to controversy , and she 's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than rochester city hall . remember the 1980s , when her `` like a prayer '' video angered the catholic church ? or the 1990s , when it seemed a camera could n't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation ? then there was last year , when she had to backtrack after posting an instagram photo of her son boxing , captioned with a take on the n-word . and in january , some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album . heck , this is n't even the the first time the singer has dissed a place where she grew up . in a 1987 interview with jane pauley , she called bay city , michigan , where she was born , a `` little smelly town in northern michigan . '' a few moments later , madonna followed up by saying she had `` great affection '' for the place . so far , no such love for rochester hills . nor has the pop icon accepted the mayor 's invite to return to her hometown for a visit .

'' cowin noted a trend : the chefs are nodding toward the past while innovating . `` chefs are also looking to their families as touchstones , '' she said . `` we 've seen a lot of paeans to grandmothers . in fact , olamaie is named for one of the two chefs ' grandmothers . tim maslow of ribelle took over his father 's restaurant , strip t 's , and reinvented the food , while leaving the décor the same . carlos salgado of taco maria was born into a family that had a mexican-american restaurant and now he 's elevated that traditional cooking . '' though many of the chefs are looking to a simpler time in their lives for inspiration , picking the top cooks in the country is no simple task . first , food & wine editors reach out to a `` trusted group of nominators '' around the country , which includes writers for the magazine , past honorees and industry insiders , for their picks . they 're looking for chefs who have been creating dishes and running a professional kitchen for five years or less . editors also comb local magazines and newspapers to find out who is generating buzz regionally . once the group of candidates is whittled down , food & wine visits the restaurants to taste the local fare anonymously . this year 's selections include a former scientist , chef katie button of curate in asheville , north carolina ; `` top chef '' season 4 contestant zoi antonitsas of westward in seattle ; and blues-lover bryce shuman of betony in new york city . `` top chef '' host tom colicchio , famed restaurateur thomas keller and international megachefs daniel boulud and nobu matsuhisa are past honorees . the july issue of food & wine hits newsstands in mid-june , and the honored chefs will be in attendance at the annual food & wine classic in aspen , colorado , that month . a complete list of this year 's food & wine top chefs is below . see the gallery above for more on the chefs and their cuisine . bryce shuman ; betony ; new york city . michael fojtasek and grae nonas ; olamaie ; austin , texas . zoi antonitsas ; westward ; seattle . jake bickelhaupt ; 42 grams ; chicago . jonathan brooks ; milktooth ; indianapolis . katie button ; curate ; asheville , north carolina . jim christiansen ; heyday ; minneapolis . tim maslow ; strip t 's and ribelle ; boston . ori menashe ; bestia ; los angeles . carlos salgado ; taco maría ; costa mesa , california .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- christopher nowak says none of his friends were surprised when he and his wife decided to use a down payment for a home on a monorail car instead . after all , this was no ordinary monorail car , and nowak is not your average collector . this was the front cab of an original monorail train that transported millions of visitors throughout walt disney world in the 1970s and 1980s . the original mark iv monorail trains were retired in 1989 to make room for a new generation of models , according to the orlando sentinel . nowak and his wife are disney fanatics who honeymooned at disney world and once visited all the disney parks in the world -lrb- minus paris -rrb- in a month . he 's also a self-described artist , inventor and collector of `` weird old vehicles , '' including an articulated bus he claims to have transformed into a mobile nightclub . the couple from chico , california , purchased the cab in 2014 , dreaming of the day they might use it to drive their kids to school or bring it to the annual burning man festival -lrb- nowak declined to say what he paid for the rail car . -rrb- but plans change . nowak listed the item last week on ebay for $ 260,000 with a starting bid of $ 169,000 . more than 1,500 people were watching the auction as of saturday night , though no one had bid . the listing itself was pulled from ebay on sunday . nowak , who owns a sound and lighting custom stage design company , had told cnn he and his wife needed the money to fund their next big project , but he declined to provide details . `` my wife and i had plans for it , but we 're kind of strapped for cash , so we figured , let 's put it out and see what happens . '' the listing provided some insight into what nowak might have had in mind for the cab . `` some people have train cars in their back yard , imagine your own monorail guest room , or man cave . mount it on a bus chassis and drive it around !! turn it into your kids ' ultimate clubhouse , '' the description on the ebay page read . `` this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a very serious piece of disney history .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- things got testy on `` cnn tonight '' when conservative commentator ben ferguson charged that rappers like trinidad james are profiting off the n-word . `` i 'll be honest with you , '' ferguson told james on monday night . `` i think you know that we should probably get rid of the n-word , but in reality , i think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they do n't stop using the word . '' the two were part of a panel discussion about who can say the n-word . the panel also included cnn commentator marc lamont hill . `` i 'm making money off of doing music and being creative , sir , '' james responded . `` i 'm not making money just because i use the n-word . nobody goes to buy an album because it 's full of the n-word . '' to which ferguson responded : `` trinidad , you would n't be on this show tonight if it was n't for using the n-word in your rap music . let 's be honest . '' trinidad james is the rapper whose hit song , `` all gold everything , '' is heard playing in the background as the house mother of the university of oklahoma sigma alpha epsilon house -- known as mom b. -- was caught on a vine video repeating the n-word seven times on camera . the woman , beauton gilbow , was bombarded with claims that she 's just as racist as the fraternity members who were caught singing a racist song on a bus earlier this month . in a previous interview with cnn , james said he was willing to give the house mom a pass -- though he said he did n't condone her use of the word . but when ferguson said monday the rapper was only on the show for his use of the word , the third panelist -- hill -- quickly jumped in . `` he would n't be on the show if a white woman had n't said the n-word on a tape , '' he said . `` white people have been saying the -lsb- n-word -rsb- long before trinidad was born .

leicester , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` god save king richard ! '' a cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of richard iii is carried away from the tower block-filled campus of the university of leicester for the final time . the medieval monarch 's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in august 2012 . but on sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became , once more , the mortal remains of a king . some 35,000 people lined the streets of leicester and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of richard 's final battle , bosworth , where he died in 1485 , before returning to the city for a commemoration at leicester cathedral . the day began on the freshly-mown lawns in front of the university 's fielding johnson building , where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell , dignitaries dressed in their sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a march shower . leicester university student anna boyer , from north carolina , said she and her classmates had come to watch the ceremony `` so i can say i was here , '' adding : `` it 's an important historical event -- we do n't have things like this in the states . '' leicester alumni sara and leeroy paskell brought their daughters saoirse , 6 , and orlaith , 9 , to watch the cortege pass by . `` we thought it would be nice for the children to see it , '' said sara paskell . `` it is amazing to be part of history , it makes me really proud of the university and of leicester . '' that pride is something which those who helped in the search for richard iii share . leicester university 's president and vice-chancellor paul boyle said the discovery of the bones had been a `` defining moment '' which `` reshaped history , '' and pointed out that the university had been custodian of richard iii 's remains for longer than he ruled england . genetics expert turi king , who proved the identity of the bones by matching their dna to a living relative of the monarch , michael ibsen , said : `` it has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved . '' king , who read robert frost 's poem `` the road not taken '' at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of richard 's heritage as a member of the house of york -- on the coffin , said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story , but not the end of the story itself ; she is still working to sequence his entire genome . michael ibsen and another living relative of richard iii , wendy duldig , were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber grey-brown bricks of the fielding johnson building ; accompanied by archaeologist richard buckley , who led the dig which uncovered the king 's bones , they walked silently behind as the cortege 's journey began . thousands of people lined the route of the procession , out through the leicestershire villages visited by richard iii on his way to the battle of bosworth . perched on fold-up picnic chairs they gathered on roadside verges , along pavements decorated with bunting , flags and paper chains of white yorkist roses , and in pub car parks to be entertained by folk dancers as they waited for the coffin to pass by . at fenn lane farm , thought to be the closest location to the spot where richard iii died , earth from three key points in his life was placed in a casket carved with his symbol , a boar . the casket , and the procession , then made their way to bosworth , where they were greeted by men dressed in medieval armor . here , richard 's role as a `` warrior king '' was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him . a beacon , which will burn until he is laid to rest on thursday , was lit on the battlefield . back in leicester , thousands more gathered around the cathedral and in nearby jubilee square . waiting to go in to the service , judy ellis , from the nearby town of hinckley , said there was a `` real buzz '' around the city . `` it 's quite exciting , coming over on the train i met people who 'd come from all over the world to be in leicester today . '' ellis , who named her son richard , said she had used the parking lot where the king 's remains were found . `` four days before the dig started i parked my car over that grave ! '' she said . adults -- some carrying single white roses and others wearing boar badges -- in village churches along the route watched the services play out on a big screen as children ran around in the late afternoon sunshine while they waited for richard 's return . in 1485 , the defeated king 's body was treated with little sense of occasion . it is said to have been slung naked over a horse and taken to leicester , where it was put on display for three days before being hurriedly crammed into a too-small plot in the grey friars church . more than five centuries on , those who sparked the search for richard iii 's remains were determined to put right that ancient wrong by giving him a more fitting farewell . philippa langley , who led the `` looking for richard '' project , said its aim was `` to give richard what he did n't get in 1485 ... to recognize what went on in the past , but not repeat it , to make peace with the past . '' to that end , the king 's skeleton is to be given two things it did not have before : a coffin and proper burial rites . the coffin is a simple affair : english oak and yew , made by richard 's relative michael ibsen who , as chance would have it , is a cabinet maker by trade ; it is carved with the king 's name and a white rose . the burial rites are somewhat more complicated : they have entailed the rebuilding of parts of leicester 's cathedral , a guest list numbering into the thousands and delicate questions of location and religion . but with those puzzles overcome , the first of several high profile pre-reinterment services was held sunday evening : the coffin was carried through the city on a gun carriage , accompanied by two `` knights '' in full suits of armor , riding on horseback , to the cathedral . those who had gathered to pay tribute to richard iii threw roses into the procession 's path as it passed the new visitor center which has been built over his original resting place . as the city 's church bells tolled and dusk began to fall , the coffin was lifted onto the shoulders of the pallbearers and taken into the cathedral , accompanied by four official `` mourners '' -- descendants of some of those who fought with richard at bosworth . once inside , it was covered with a heavily-embroidered cloth , and a bible and specially-commissioned crown were laid atop the casket , the latter by a local brownie , 9-year-old emma chamberlain , whose height meant a step had to be placed next to the coffin to allow her to reach it . in his sermon , the archbishop of westminster , cardinal vincent nichols alluded to richard iii 's controversial reputation and `` tumultuous life , '' which had seen moments of `` astonishing brutality . '' nichols said the king 's short reign was `` marked by unrest and the fatal seepage of loyalty and support '' but insisted that he was also `` a man of prayer , a man of anxious devotion '' and one who had done good for his people . as those who had attended filed back out into the darkening spring evening , one final illuminated tribute was paid : the initials riii and a crown were projected onto the cathedral 's tower , while nearby , white roses surrounded a statue of the king . as she left the service , victoria mckeown , who won a ticket to the event , said the experience had been `` brilliant '' and the memorial `` absolutely lovely . '' `` it 's a lovely way to spend a sunday evening -- not like being at home doing the ironing , '' she told cnn . `` it 's part of history : i can say ` i 've been to a king 's funeral . ' ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as the seventh full week of testimony in the first-degree murder trial against former new england patriots star aaron hernandez came to a close this week , witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing . hernandez is on trial in fall river , massachusetts , in connection with the shooting death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013 . the former tight end had signed a five-year contract extension worth $ 40 million but , less than a year later , hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancée . hours after his arrest on june 26 , 2013 , the patriots dropped him from the team . two of hernandez 's closest associates are co-defendants in the case . evidence collected in lloyd 's death led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston . he is accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado in july 2012 , allegedly over a spilled drink . two witnesses who saw hernandez at the boston nightclub rumor just 48 hours before lloyd 's killing said he looked angry and aggressive . lloyd was with hernandez at the club that friday night . on thursday , prosecutors called witness no. 100 : kasey arma , a nightclub promoter . she told jurors she danced with aaron hernandez at the club in the early morning of june 15 , 2013 . hernandez approached her . `` he walked by me and he tapped my hip . '' arma testified that she danced with hernandez for about 10 minutes . `` he was pleasant and kind of charming , '' she said . then he left abruptly . when he returned about 10 minutes later , arma said , hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club . his demeanor changed . he was `` very aggressive , '' she testified . then , she said , he asked her `` to show what i could do with that thing , '' referring to her backside . `` he was irritated and very aggressive , '' she told the jury . during cross-examination , defense attorney michael fee showed surveillance video of arma dancing with hernandez . there was bumping and grinding , mostly with her backside to him . it was uncomfortable to watch in court . jurors watched the video with laser focus . fee asked arma , `` what kind of dance is that called ? '' arma said she did n't know . some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly . earlier in the week , witness kwami nicholas testified that he also saw hernandez at rumor and the ex-player `` seemed like he was angry about something . '' hernandez 's mouth looked like a `` grunt , '' he said . nicholas , a college student , was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with lloyd . when lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends , hernandez looked angry , according to nicholas . hernandez was standing near the dj at the time , about 15 feet away from lloyd and his friend . nicholas said hernandez glared at them for a few minutes . during tough questioning from fee , nicholas stood his ground . the defense showed jurors nicholas ' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of hernandez . nicholas also remembered hernandez `` storming out of the club . '' `` he looked angry , '' nicholas told the jury . as hernandez walked down the street , `` he motioned back with his arms as if to say get away from me . '' prosecutors played surveillance video backing up nicholas ' description . during that video , lloyd is also seen following hernandez at a distance . though prosecutors are trying to establish that hernandez was angry , jurors still do n't know why . shayanna jenkins , hernandez 's fiancée and mother of his baby daughter , was not in court to see the dirty-dancing video . she has n't been seen in court since march 6 . but jenkins ' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from hernandez 's house in november 2014 . jurors were not present for that debate . the prosecution showed before-and-after photos of a closet in hernandez 's home in north attleboro . one photo from june 2013 showed the sneakers hernandez wore the night lloyd was killed . it also showed the shoes hernandez associate carlos ortiz wore the same night . the two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes . in the second photo , taken in november 2014 , the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones hernandez and ortiz were wearing the night of the shooting . they were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house . prosecutors wanted to link jenkins to the disappearance of the shoes . mccauley referred to the defendant 's jailhouse comments that `` she does what i want , '' referring to jenkins . mccauley also told the judge that hernandez `` was directing her -lrb- jenkins -rrb- to give money to tanya singleton at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk . '' he added , `` we know she did n't talk and then was held in contempt . '' tanya singleton is hernandez 's cousin . court observers wonder when jenkins will be back . the last time jenkins was in court , a reporter noticed she was no longer wearing her engagement ring . however , jenkins is facing perjury charges for allegedly lying to investigators and has been granted immunity to testify at the trial . will testimony about hernandez 's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about jenkins -- affect her testimony ? does her absence mean she 'll turn on her fiance ? the answers may be a few weeks away . there are indications the commonwealth may wrap up its case by mid-april , . much testimony focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot . a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows in a size 13 . about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13 . the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , according to lt. steven bennett of the massachusetts state police . the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . yet bennett , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footwear impression left near lloyd 's body was `` in agreement '' or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13 . although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night , he an identical pair to make his determination . bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression . jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression . what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan . sultan questioned the science behind analyzing foot impressions , and he introduced a march 2014 report from bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to make a comparison . sultan hammered bennett on that report . bennett admitted that his reexamination helped the prosecution . mccauley was able to undo some of the damage , allowing bennett to explain that it was only after gaining access to air jordan retro 11s in december 2014 that he was able to make a comparison . he testified that what he thought was a lack of distinction were actually gaps in the design of the sole . it 's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in november 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by hernandez , ortiz and ernest wallace -- another co-defendant -- the night of lloyd 's death , despite having a photo of them from june 2013 . seventeen months into the investigation , they searched hernandez 's house again . none of the shoes were found . the prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along john dietsch boulevard where lloyd 's body was found . with these witnesses and collected surveillance videos , prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say hernandez drove to the corliss landing crime scene . while the car 's make and model are n't distinguishable in the video , jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when hernandez , wallace , ortiz and lloyd would have been in the car . tanya singleton arranged for her aunt to drive her and wallace to georgia in the days after lloyd 's death . testifying for the prosecution , euna ritchon said singleton asked her on june 21 , 2013 , to move up her planned trip to visit her daughter in georgia . she brought wallace with her . at the time , singleton was married to ritchon 's nephew , tl singleton . he died in a car crash a little more than a week later . ritchon also testified that wallace suggested using back roads to drive out of connecticut and through new york to avoid tolls . she said wallace carried his clothes in a black trash bag . prosecutors were attempting to get jurors to link it to the black trash bag shayanna jenkins removed from her house just a few days earlier . prosecutors say that bag held the gun used to kill lloyd . after spending the night at the home of ritchon 's daughter , wallace boarded a bus to florida . that 's where he surrendered to police . wallace has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in lloyd 's death .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it was a ding , just a `` minor concussion , '' that got chris borland thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an nfl player . borland was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in august when he got his `` bell rung , '' he told espn 's `` outside the lines . '' what did he do ? he kept playing that day , and through an excellent rookie season . but the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him . he talked to his teammates and family , read about concussions and their effects , each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week . at age 24 , not even yet in his prime as an nfl player , borland told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma . `` i just honestly want to do what 's best for my health , '' he told espn . `` from what i 've researched and what i 've experienced , i do n't think it 's worth the risk . ... i 'm concerned that if you wait -lrb- until -rrb- you have symptoms , it 's too late . '' it was after that self-described `` minor concussion '' in the preseason that borland threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players . in the end he did n't want to leave his teammates in a bind , but , `` i know this is right for me . '' he said teammates ' reactions to his retirement were mixed . one of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money . borland , a third-round pick from wisconsin , had signed a nearly $ 3 million contract for four seasons with the san francisco 49ers and banked a $ 600,000 bonus . the guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top tackler , `` that 's a lot of money . why do n't you get your money and get out , '' borland recounted to espn . the thought made him uncomfortable because he does n't want to do anything just for a big paycheck . he did n't want to be wrong when it comes to this : `` who knows how many hits are too many ? '' borland is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him . he 's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete . reports show an increasing number of retired nfl players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia , alzheimer 's disease , depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte . `` for me , it 's wanting to be proactive , '' borland said . `` i 'm concerned that if you wait -lrb- until -rrb- you have symptoms , it 's too late . there are a lot of unknowns . i ca n't claim that ` x ' will happen . `` i just want to live a long , healthy life , and i do n't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than i would otherwise . '' passionate reactions to his decision came quickly , with many supporting him . others say that while the move might be smart for borland , and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health , there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him . borland told espn that he was n't saying no one should play football . he said youth players and their parents should do things : 1 -rrb- get informed about concussions and 2 -rrb- never let anyone play . last august , thousands of former nfl players and their families reached a deal in a class-action suit that called for the nfl to cover the cost of concussion-related compensation , medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families . the suit alleged that the nfl deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions . in july 2014 , a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement . chris dronett was one of the plaintiffs . her husband , former denver bronco shane dronett , committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38 . after his death , scientists found evidence of cte in his brain . borland named three players he said made him rethink a life in the nfl . `` i 've thought about what i could accomplish in football , but for me personally , when you read about mike webster and dave duerson and ray easterling , you read all these stories . and to be the type of player i want to be in football , i think i 'd have to take on some risks that as a person i do n't want to take on , '' he said . webster had a career with the pittsburgh steelers and kansas city chiefs from 1974 to 1990 . he was the first former nfl player to be diagnosed with cte . after he retired , he was diagnosed with amnesia , dementia , depression , and bone and muscle pain . he was 50 when he died . duerson killed himself with a gunshot to the chest . he had sent a text to his family asking that his brain be sent to boston university school of medicine , which was researching cte . bu neurologists confirmed the nfl veteran had the disease . easterling , who played eight seasons with the atlanta falcons , committed suicide in 2012 . he apparently suffered dementia . an autopsy revealed he had cte . some on social media said borland 's decision made them think about former nfl linebacker junior seau . he was 43 when he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest . friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide , but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage . portions of seau 's brain were sent to the national institutes of health , which found `` abnormalities ... that are consistent with a form '' of cte . he will be inducted into the pro football hall of fame this summer . the nfl has reported that in 2013 , 228 concussions were diagnosed from practices and games . at least 261 were diagnosed the previous year , the league said . in its statement about borland 's retirement , jeff miller , the nfl 's senior vice president for health and safety , said : `` we respect chris borland 's decision and wish him all the best . playing any sport is a personal decision . by any measure , football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes , safer tackling techniques at all levels of football , and better equipment , protocols and medical care for players . '' miller added that the league understands there is more work to do to improve player safety . complaints keep coming . in july of last year , ex-nfl players christian ballard and gregory westbrooks filed suit against the nfl players association , alleging the union withheld information about head injuries . opinion : why are these nflers retiring early ? cnn 's jill martin contributed to this report .

coral gables , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- former president bill clinton on saturday defended his family foundation 's practice of taking money from foreign countries , arguing that while he does n't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed , he feels the foundation has `` done a lot more good than harm . '' the clinton foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the obama administration put in place with the foundation when hillary clinton became secretary of state in 2009 . bill clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects . `` the uae -lsb- united arab emirates -rsb- gave us money . do we agree with everything they do ? no . but they are helping us fight isis and they built a great university with nyu open to people around the world , '' clinton said at a foundation event in florida . `` do i agree with all the foreign policy of saudi arabia ? no . '' saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and oman are among the countries that donated to the clinton foundation . clinton continued : `` you 've got to decide when you do this work , whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country . ... i believe we have done a lot more good than harm . '' the story became a controversy for the clintons , one where even some democrats questioned the practice . hillary clinton is the party 's presidential frontrunner in 2016 and is expected to announce her presidential aspirations next month . republicans jumped on board the story , too , using it to question the clintons ' ethics and whether , as president , she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation . democrats that did publicly defend the clintons noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website . on saturday , clinton did the same . `` my theory about all this is disclose everything . and then let people make their judgments , '' clinton said . `` i 'm going to tell you who gave us money and you can make your own decisions . '' clinton concluded his defense of the foundation , stating that he thinks organizations should `` bring people together across great divides , around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better . '' the clinton foundation was founded by bill clinton after he left the presidency in 2001 . to date , the foundation has raised over $ 2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects , including health and wellness , economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls . many of their projects focus on international issues , such as rebuilding haiti after the 2010 earthquake and providing access to low-cost hiv and aids treatment . those were primarily the projects backed by foreign countries . the former president 's comments were the only moment any clinton mentioned the foreign fundraising controversy . neither hillary or chelsea clinton mentioned the issue . at no point saturday did any of the clintons address the fact that hillary clinton exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as america 's top diplomat , a practice that skirted legal standards in place . the former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage saturday and did n't mention question about her email , instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation . that did n't bother the over 1,000 overachieving millennials at the clinton global initiative university meeting who could n't have cared less about the swirling email and fundraising controversies that have defined the clintons the last few weeks . saturday 's event is the university-focused branch of the clinton foundation . it brings philanthropic minded students from around the world together to talk about their projects and pitch the foundation for funding . this year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things , from increasing women 's inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting potable water from fog . in total , the foundation will hand out $ 900,000 to the different students . the general sense among the event attendees was : `` what controversies ? '' `` i am here for me . i am here for learning , exploring , meeting new people and expanding my knowledge about nonprofit management and social change , '' said armel arnaud nibasumba , a middlebury college student born and raised in burundi . `` i do n't really care if they address those political issues that are going on . '' a few students , including victoria arild from menlo college , said they had n't heard of the controversies . `` i am here because my college , i had the privilege of them funding me , '' she said , before shrugging off questions about the email issues .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in yemen on thursday , with saudi arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor 's civil war , potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the middle east . the swift and sudden action involved 100 saudi jets , 30 from the united arab emirates , 15 each from kuwait and bahrain , 10 from qatar , and a handful from jordan , morocco and sudan , plus naval help from pakistan and egypt , according to a saudi adviser . the egyptian state news agency on thursday quoted egypt 's foreign ministry as saying egypt 's support also could involve ground forces . what do those countries have in common ? they 're all predominantly sunni muslim -- in contrast to the houthi rebels , shiite muslims who have taken over yemen 's capital of sanaa and on wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city , aden . the saudis consider the houthis proxies for the shiite government of iran and fear another shiite-dominated state in the region . `` what they do not want is an iranian-run state on their southern border , '' cnn military analyst lt. col. rick francona said of the saudis . the airstrikes did not include warplanes from the united states , which has worked with yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling president abdu rabu mansour hadi -- to go after al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . in fact , a senior official in president barack obama 's administration said `` there will be no military intervention by the u.s. '' but u.s. secretary of state john kerry on thursday did tell foreign ministers from saudi arabia , the uae , qatar , kuwait , bahrain and oman that the united states commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , according to a senior state department official . how did yemen get to this place ? houthi supreme leader abdul malik al-houthi spoke live thursday night in yemen on al-masirah tv , saying , `` if any army try to invade our country , we will prove that yemen will be a grave for those who invade us . '' he added , `` we call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner . '' iran denounced the military intervention . marzieh afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's foreign ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to yemen 's monthslong internal strife . it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like isis and al qaeda , she said . `` this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , '' afkham said , according to a report in iran 's state-run islamic republic news agency . iraq -- 60 % of whose citizens are shiite , with about 20 % being sunnis -- offered similar , albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its foreign ministry called `` the military interference of the gulf cooperation council , '' which is made up of bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar , saudi arabia and the uae . `` we call on the arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue -lrb- that includes -rrb- all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis , '' the iraqi ministry said . the houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in yemen . in addition to airstrikes , the saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in yemen . just a day in , the coalition airstrikes are already costing the houthis . hundreds of explosions ripped through sanaa overnight , said journalist hakim almasmari , who is staying in the capital . the health ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in sanaa , the houthi-run saba news agency said . while sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the houthis ' combat and control operations there , the saudi adviser said -- it was n't the only place struck . compounds and military installations in saada and taiz also were targeted . by thursday afternoon , the saudis controlled yemeni airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter yemeni ports . the military operation , dubbed al-hazm storm , was launched after the houthis rebuffed an initiative by the gulf cooperation council , arab league chief nabil al-arabi said in a speech thursday . it was done in accord with a joint arab defense treaty , al-arabi said . specifically , the strikes aim to support hadi , who was ousted in january after talks with the houthis faltered , but still claims to be yemen 's rightful leader . `` we are determined to protect the legitimate government of yemen , '' said adel al-jubeir , the saudi ambassador to the united states , in announcing the beginning of the military campaign . `` having yemen fail can not be an option for us or for our coalition partners . '' why is saudi arabia bombing yemen ? jubeir told cnn 's `` the situation room with wolf blitzer '' that saudi arabia was concerned that the houthis had control over yemen 's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force , and the fact that iran backs the houthis was troubling . `` this is really a war to defend the legitimate government of yemen and protect the yemeni people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with iran and hezbollah , '' he said . american military commanders said they did n't know about saudi arabia 's action until the last minute . `` we have been discussing this matter with the united states in principle for many months , '' jubeir said . `` we have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action did n't really happen until the last minute , because of circumstances in yemen . '' egyptian foreign minister sameh shoukry on thursday proposed a joint arab military `` to deal with these challenges . '' but at least one major player in yemen besides the houthis -- the general people 's congress , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out . the gpc says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties . the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said . `` the -lrb- party -rrb- expresses its rejection of the attack on the republic of yemen and the capital , sanaa , considering what -lrb- is -rrb- happening is an internal affair , '' the gpc said .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a huge obama foreign policy decision , a big immigration question and interesting steps related to hillary clinton , john boehner and marco rubio filled an informative sunday loop around the ` inside politics ' table . there 's nothing like a signature hire to quiet those who think you might blink and skip the fight . at issue is sen. marco rubio of florida , who remains a single-digit blip in republican polls . so weak have his early poll showings been that many gopers to this day say they would not be shocked if he decided not to move from exploratory candidate to official candidate . but a new hire sends a signal . veteran south carolina gop strategist j. warren tompkins is signing on to run a pro-rubio super pac . that same pac is in line for seed money from florida billionaire norman braman . tompkins is a protege of the late gop gov. carroll campbell and legendary south carolina strategist lee atwater . his hiring is seen as a signal in gop circles that rubio is close to launching . for those of us who lived through the clinton white house years , and especially the monica lewinsky scandal , it was interesting to say the least listening to hillary clinton a few days ago wax nostalgic about her relationship with newt gingrich . and the former house speaker shared similar fond memories in a conversation with jackie kucinich of the daily beast . but do n't break into `` kumbaya '' or order the marshmallows . `` he said , if she becomes president , she 'll be a hard worker ; she 'll be pretty practical , '' said kucinich . `` however , he does n't think she 's going to get there because of what 's happening with the clinton global foundation and because of the foreign money . he 's testifying to the homeland security committee next week and he says he 's going to bring up the problem of foreign money in american politics . '' it 's been a rough start for the republican congress and house speaker john boehner . but boehner sees a chance to get two big-ticket items on their way to passage , and through those debates to get the house back on a more productive track . robert costa of the washington post shared his reporting on the speaker 's calculations -- including one health care bill where he struck up an alliance with democratic leader nancy pelosi . `` there 's two pieces of legislation to really keep an eye on that he wants to muscle through , '' said costa . `` one is the republican budget : he wants to just get it through the house , get a compromise with the senate . and the next is the doc fix bill , which is how medicare reimbursements are done for doctors . boehner wants to solve that long-term and it looks like he is going to have the votes to get it done . '' president obama meets with afghan president ashraf ghani this week , and is open to slowing the withdrawal of u.s. forces . a big change , but with a bigger goal in mind . julie pace of the associated press shared inside reporting on the administration 's willingness to leave up to 10,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan for the time being . `` there 's one big reason why the president is going to have some flexibility in the drawdown , and that 's because he 's very focused on one specific aspect of this plan , and that is pulling out all u.s. troops by the end of 2016 , '' said pace . `` that would allow him to make the case at the end of his presidency that he had fulfilled his promise to end the war in afghanistan . '' the always intense political debate over immigration policy heated up last spring during a dramatic surge in the number of young children illegally crossing into the united states . the surge undermined what was already a long shot chance of congressional consensus on immigration reform . npr 's steve inskeep reports that both policymakers and political strategists are watching to see if there is a similar seasonal surge this year . `` now we 're getting back into the spring season , when it 's a little bit easier to travel , and we 'll see if the numbers go up again , '' said inskeep . `` if they do , of course , we 're going to have another series of news stories about a really sensitive issue that 's been very difficult for either party to solve .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- organized labor is up in arms about president barack obama 's effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the asia pacific that involves 11 nations . the agreement , union leaders argue , threatens to take even more jobs away from americans . afl-cio president richard trumka sent a clear message to members of congress , warning , `` there is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact , and then we will not forget this vote for a long time . '' the afl-cio announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up . the tension between organized labor and obama is not new . the struggles have been going on since 2009 when the president allowed the employee free choice act to wither in congress . the act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions . the president avoided making any strong appeals for the bill , though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership . when democrats chose charlotte , north carolina , for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid . `` there is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials , '' one labor leader said , `` broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda . '' even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the affordable care act , president obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions . organized labor has not been that surprised . the truth is that unions have been on the defense against democratic presidents for decades . in the 1970s , president jimmy carter treated unions like one more special interest in washington that needed to be brought down while president bill clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed . `` it will cost jobs , '' warned michigan democrat david bonior said of the north american free trade agreement that clinton endorsed . `` it will drive down our standard of living . if we do n't stand up for the working people in this country , who is going to ? '' in the past few decades , many democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party , as they had been during the creation of the new deal and great society . as organized labor became a smaller part of the american workforce , democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote . a larger number of democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence . these voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues , such as environmental regulation , than they are with middle class jobs . many democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets . new voices that came into the democratic party after the 1960s wanted to challenge republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy . the opportunities for democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives . the koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions . scott walker , the governor of wisconsin and potential republican presidential candidate , has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who were n't in unions . unions are under assault , and the movement is looking for help . democrats , and some republicans , often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality . much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions . shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class americans . without strong unions , the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started . as george gresham , the president of united health care workers east wrote in the new york times , `` by defunding unions and weakening union members via ` right to work ' laws , corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers ' primary means of raising wages , securing pensions and improving workers conditions . workers ' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized . '' democrats need to listen to what the afl-cio is saying . they need to push back against president obama , even if this creates political opportunities for republicans , so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda . as democrats continually watch republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit , they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the white house and congress in the coming years .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- opening statements in the murder trial of movie theater massacre suspect james holmes are scheduled for april 27 , more than a month ahead of schedule , a colorado court spokesman said . holmes , 27 , is charged as the sole gunman who stormed a crowded movie theater at a midnight showing of `` the dark knight rises '' in aurora , colorado , and opened fire , killing 12 people and wounding 58 more in july 2012 . when the trial began in january , some 9,000 potential jurors were summoned , and jury selection was expected then to continue until may or june , when the trial would finally start . the jury selection process , however , appears to be moving faster than expected , according to court spokesman rob mccallum . in january , judge carlos a. samour jr. told the first pool of potential jurors that if chosen for the jury , they can not read , watch or hear anything about the case . `` this will require great effort on your part , '' the judge said three times . holmes , a one-time neuroscience doctoral student , faces 166 counts , including murder and attempted murder charges . holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . if convicted of the most serious charges , he could face a death sentence . prosecutors have charged in court that holmes `` intended to kill them all , '' referring to patrons in the crowded cinema watching the batman film `` the dark knight rises . '' holmes colored his hair a comic-book red and told police he was `` the joker '' upon arrest after the mass killing . holmes was heavily armed and `` dressed head-to-toe in protective gear , '' authorities said . he wore black contact lenses to conceal his eyes . his ar-15 jammed during the shooting , police said , and they arrested him in the parking lot . the trial itself could last four months . if there 's a conviction , the death penalty phase could last another month , which means court proceedings could last until fall . cnn 's sara weisfeldt contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- debra milke spent 22 years on death row , convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout . on monday , a judge ruled that the arizona woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her . this makes milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the united states . more importantly , the judge 's decision finally clears milke after years of legal back-and-forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence . key to the case 's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct , mainly that of a detective , armando saldate , who said milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording . prosecutors withheld from the jury saldate 's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases , including lying under oath . the two men with whom milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row . a day after seeing santa claus at a mall on december 1 , 1989 , young christopher milke asked his mother if he could go again . milke 's roomate , james styers , took the boy ; then called milke saying christopher had disappeared . instead , styers and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where styers shot christopher three times in the head , prosecutors said . styers and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death . milke was implicated based on alleged testimony from styer 's friend , roger scott . the detective , saldate , said scott told him that milke was involved in a plot to kill her son . and during her trial , prosecutors floated a likely motive : a $ 5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child . but neither scott nor styers testified to a plot in court . no other witnesses or direct evidence linked milke to the crime other than saldate 's testimony . saldate further said that milke confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a `` bad judgment call . '' there was no recording of the interrogation , no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror , and saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report . milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role . the trial became a he-said/she-said contest between the two . ultimately , the jury believed the detective and convicted milke of murder . what prosecutors did n't tell the court was the detective 's long history of lying under oath and misconduct . saldate had been suspended five days for taking `` liberties '' with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors . four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because saldate had lied under oath . judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because saldate had violated a person 's constitutional rights . in 2013 , after more than 20 years in jail , an appeals court overturned milke 's conviction . `` the constitution requires a fair trial , '' chief judge alex kozinski of the federal 9th circuit court of appeals wrote . `` this never happened in milke 's case . '' `` the state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents , '' kozinski said . '' ... there can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation . '' milke was released on bail , and the court said she could n't be tried again . the state appealed the decision to the arizona supreme court . last week , the arizona supreme court refused to hear the appeal . and on monday , all charges against milke were finally dropped . the ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed . and milke left the court room , sobbing in relief . the case is now closed . debra milke is finally a free woman .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- isis militants kidnapped 20 foreigners working at a libyan hospital , then released them -- under the condition , if they want to live , that they stay put so they can treat members of the islamist extremist group , a hospital official said . about 30 gunmen tied to the group calling itself the islamic state stormed ibn sina hospital in sirte on monday while a bus was waiting to take the workers to tripoli , libya 's capital . the medical workers were later released and sent back to their homes near the medical facility , a hospital official said tuesday . but they ca n't go far , with isis militants ordering them not to leave sirte , according to the official . one of those kidnapped , a doctor from uzbekistan , was told he is safe as long as he did n't leave , and he treated any militants who were wounded , the hospital official said . `` they told him that , for your life , you -lrb- stay -rrb- and work in the city , '' the official added . like the doctor , the other medical workers are n't libyan . most are from the philippines , with others from ukraine , india and serbia . the kidnappings came days after people of filipino , austrian , czech , ghanaian and bangladeshi descent were taken from libya 's al-ghani oil field , an operation that libya 's internationally recognized government blamed on `` isis militias . '' the abductions are more evidence of the turmoil libya has experienced since 2011 , the start of an uprising against longtime dictator moammar gadhafi . sirte was gadhafi 's hometown , where he was killed , and where his loyalists held out the longest . in the years since , sirte has become a home to isis . the coastal city , halfway between tripoli and benghazi , is where terrorists kidnapped 21 coptic christians from egypt in separate incidents in december and january . that mass abduction was followed by mass slaughter -- one that , in isis ' distinctive , depraved style , was videotaped and disseminated as propaganda , showing jihadists standing behind their orange-clad , handcuffed victims and then beheading them . `` the sea you have hidden sheikh osama bin laden 's body in , '' a masked english-speaking jihadi said on the video , `` we swear to allah , we will mix it with your blood . '' like the egyptians , the medical workers kidnapped monday are foreigners , having come to sirte to work . they also have skills that could help isis . the ibn sina hospital official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who 'd been trying to flee sirte 's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat isis militants . the large-scale kidnapping illustrates how isis has become a disruptive force in africa . the group 's main foothold is in iraq and syria , where it has ruthlessly conquered territory and threatened to take more despite efforts by local governments and a u.s.-led air campaign . isis branched out into libya last year , with cnn reporting in november that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of derna , a city of about 100,000 near the egyptian border . militants who 've pledged allegiance to isis also have made their mark in points westward , forming chapters in cities including sirte , benghazi and tripoli , according to noman benotman , a former libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the quilliam foundation . besides its actions in derna and sirte , isis ' libyan branch claimed responsibility for a january attack on a luxury hotel in tripoli that killed 10 people , one of them american david berry . but isis is n't just active in libya . earlier this month , boko haram -- another islamist extremist group with its own reputation for mass abductions and craven brutality -- pledged allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . this bond gives isis a gateway to west africa and specifically to nigeria , africa 's most populous nation and boko haram 's home .

'' i screamed . yes . this is actually what i signed up for when i uploaded my video to the cnn fit nation website in december . `` but climbing mountains on sunday morning -- you got to be kidding me , '' i exclaimed . but it was all part of the process i realized i was going to take on as i learn how to be a triathlete . after our first initial week with a trainer and nutritionist , the six of us were introduced to a whole new way of how to approach fitness and how to incorporate it into our lives . i knew it was going to be a difficult task , especially for someone like me heavily involved in civic affairs and community service . at lifetime fitness , our nutritionist walked us through a number of exercises on how we should look at food , nutrition and our calorie intake . after being on several diets over my lifetime , what he said was simple . to look and review your intake and replace it with other foods such as fruit and vegetables -- these small steps can be major impact on your training . tackling nutrition and calorie intake can also be exactly how i viewed the climb up stone mountain . i put these nutritional issues on the backburner for years . it was pretty much like looking at the mountain that i was about to climb that morning -- where do i start , where do i begin ? -- and telling myself that it was going to be an arduous task . my training schedule has also been an uphill battle . in january and the first weeks of february , i started strong with my gym , running and swim workouts . however , as life pressures got in the way , i saw myself withering off . but luckily i have been inspired by my 2015 cnn fit nation teammates to keep me on track . their updates have been truly inspiring and have helped me think about the struggles i face in my training activities . as i get older , i realize that fitness and nutrition are key to long-term health ; however , the support of friends and family is also important to help tackle your health . my team members of the cnn fit nation have been there for me . i recently weighed myself when i visited the doctor 's office . it has been six weeks since i hit the scale . i actually lost 20 pounds . what ! really ! uphill battles are hard to see when you are in the middle of them . but you keep moving . just like that sunday afternoon in january , i could not wait to be on the mountaintop and see the view from stone mountain with the members of 2015 cnn fit nation . and guess what ? after all this huffing and puffing over the last six weeks , i ca n't wait to see the view in september at the malibu triathlon . it 's just another uphill mountain to climb .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- i was in florida last year when i got a call asking me to pose for a calendar . what ? a calendar ? as in sports illustrated swimsuit ? victoria 's secret angels ? cover girls . pinups . movie stars . glam . i agreed , and now i am ms. december . but it is n't quite what you think . the caller on the other end that day was patti tripathi . she was an anchor at cnn headline news at a time when there were few indian-american women in high-profile media jobs . tripathi has her own media company now , but more recently she launched a nonprofit called saris to suits . she was asking me to help . she began by telling me her story . she was 12 when her family immigrated to the united states . indian parents often have to save a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter . tripathi said that was a big reason why her family left . we spoke about similar experiences as indian teenagers in america . she was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts , except to play tennis . she had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college . tripathi felt like a burden . she did everything she could to stand on her own . and she did . my father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become `` americanized . '' i , too , longed to be independent , far more so than was expected of a bengali girl in the 1970s . at an all-girls convent school in kolkata , i used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom . on every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders , most of them indian . hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the stampede-like dash up the stairwell . it was impossible to stop but i always looked up when i arrived at indira gandhi . there she was , in her trademark white sari and what i thought was a cruella de vil slice in her hair . in a nation that valued boys more than girls , i was in awe that we had a female prime minister . gandhi 's political career turned out to be less than stellar , but it was 1971 and i was not yet 9 years old . i wanted to grow up to be just like her . regal . smart . and most of all , in control of my destiny . i know so many other indian girls felt the same . we had dreams . big dreams . we wanted to be someone , do something rewarding with our lives . yet for so many girls in india , dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios . they are denied education and married off within months of their first period . i have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men . those problems are not limited to india or the rest of south asia . they exist in the immigrant communities in the united states , in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists . women are often ashamed to talk about these things . as an indian-american journalist , i have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many south asian women . i have mentored girls in my hometown of kolkata . and always wondered : what else can i do ? some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life . as a newborn , i was left on the steps of an orphanage in north kolkata . it happened to be run by an american missionary , helen benedict , who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the indo-american society . my mother was honing her english speaking skills there . that was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage . it 's not hard to guess the rest of the story . instead of growing up in harsh surroundings , i was raised in a professor 's house . and , instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness , i faced one that was bright . i had loving parents , attended good schools and traveled around the world . there is not a day that goes by when i do n't think about the life i might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an american missionary and a bengali woman pining to become a mother . i shared my story with tripathi and told her i would help . tripathi put together saris to suits as an empowerment tool . she wanted to raise money to help south asian women . she also wanted to inspire them , she said . they needed strong role models . they needed to know that they could break out of the molds that were cast for them . she was putting together the 2015 saris to suits calendar and wanted to feature south asian women who had found success in america . they were doctors , lawyers , corporate leaders . one was a weightlifter from pakistan who struggled with balancing her sport and her muslim attire . another was miss america 2014 . i felt honored to be in such fine company . i would be the only journalist in the calendar . it would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend i was a glamour girl . some of the women opted to wear saris , the traditional dress of india . some wore salwar kameez , a long tunic and pants . and some of us were in suits or our work attire . the 2014 calendar , the first one tripathi published , raised money for various organizations that help south asian women . one of them was raksha -lrb- which means protection -rrb- . based in atlanta , raksha provides support for the south asian community in a number of ways . most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages , divorce and issues with their children . raksha 's executive director , aparna bhattacharyya , told me why the calendar was important . `` i think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves , '' she said . `` i think it is powerful for young south asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams . '' her words took me back to my school in kolkata where i gazed upward at indira gandhi 's face . in it , i found strength . i am of course , a far cry from the likes of gandhi , but perhaps i can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future . maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life . besides , it 's kind of cool to be in a calendar .

'' court documents from the case include letters the family wrote , asking the court to show mercy and vowing that the teen would never repeat his mistake . `` tony has made a grave decision , one which may cost him his freedom , but before a decision is made i want you to know him as his family does . a loving son , a responsible older brother and a kindhearted , incredibly intelligent young man with hopes and dreams to become successful and to move forward in life , '' wrote lorien carter , his aunt . `` growing up impoverished , and without his father , tony managed to excel in school and sports . graduating high school a semester early , he was on a great track . '' his grandmother , sharon irwin , described him as `` a great kid in between being a teen and a man . '' `` what he did was wrong . following behind a boy he just met . he did n't want to go yet did it anyway , '' she wrote . `` that is one of his issues . impulsive . the other is being a follower . '' carter said his nephew 's run-in with the law last year had nothing to do with last week 's shooting . robinson paid his debt to society and was trying to find his way and better his life , according to his uncle . `` they try to associate his past with this act , to paint a picture about the type of kid he was , '' he said . `` he was a good , kindhearted kid who was very happy and just wanted to be accepted and wanted to be loved . '' a gofundme page collecting donations for robinson 's family says he was hoping to go to college and study business . recent social media posts from the teen point to a troubling time in his life . in one post , he wrote , `` i hate my mind . '' another said , `` i do n't need help im not crazy . '' a post from january says , `` my soul is dying . '' according to the wisconsin state journal , citing court documents , robinson dealt with anxiety issues , depression and adhd . robinson 's mother , andrea irwin , stressed that her son was never violent . `` my son has never been a violent person , never , '' she told cnn affiliate wkow . `` to die in such a violent way baffles me . '' during a confrontation before friday night 's shooting , officer matt kenny suffered a blow to the head , madison police chief mike koval said . he has been placed on paid administrative leave while authorities investigate the shooting . madison mayor paul soglin said officials are n't going to put the teen on trial . `` that 's not what this is about . what this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine , then , responsibility , '' he told cnn 's `` ac360 . '' `` we know that he was not armed , and as far as the police chief and i are concerned ... the fact that tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- budi , an adorable baby orangutan , is on the road to recovery after an animal shelter in indonesia rescued him . the 15-month-old was on the brink of death after he was kept in a chicken cage and fed nothing but condensed milk for the first year of his life . he had been kept as a pet in ketapang , indonesia , his caretakers said . now budi is well enough to eat on his own , walk and climb . `` after weeks of physiotherapy , medical treatment and a nutritious diet , budi 's muscles are developing well , '' said united kingdom-based international animal rescue . but budi 's development remains slow due to the extreme malnutrition , his caretakers said . budi was in quarantine for awhile , they said , but has been introduced to another infant orangutan , jemmi , rescued by another shelter . neither orangutan had met another animal of its kind since being taken from their mothers just after birth , and they eyed each other with curiosity . when budi arrived at international animal rescue 's orangutan rescue center in ketapang , his condition was extremely critical . his body was swollen with fluid due to a severe lack of protein . his limbs were misshapen because he was never fed properly . budi 's `` eyes fill with tears ever time he 's moved by the doctors and he screams in pain , '' said dr. karmele llano sanchez , international animal rescue 's program director in indonesia . `` it 's really amazing that budi has been able to survive this long . '' it 's unclear how budi became someone 's pet , said dr. ayu handayani . the owner said that she was afraid to give the animal any fruit and believed that giving budi only condensed milk was enough , handayani said . eventually , the caretakers said , when budi is strong enough , he will be released into the wild .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- jeffrey williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in ferguson , police said , but claimed he was n't aiming for them . nonetheless , the 20-year-old from the st. louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week 's protests in ferguson , missouri , a prosecutor said sunday . williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault , a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity , st. louis county prosecuting attorney bob mcculloch said . he described williams as a frequent protester in the city -- which some took issue with . bishop derrick robinson , an area organizer , said he spoke to williams on sunday . `` i asked him why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we 've done to rebuild our community , '' robinson said . `` it sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it , but he admitted to me that he 'd never protested . '' for more than 200 days , protests have taken place in ferguson since the august shooting death of unarmed black teenager michael brown . ferguson police officer darren wilson was not indicted . at the time of his arrest , williams was on probation for receiving stolen property . the prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest . he said police served a search warrant on williams ' residence where they seized a .40 - caliber handgun , `` which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered '' at the scene of the shooting . williams is being held on a cash-only $ 300,000 bond , mcculloch said , adding that it 's possible williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case . one element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent , mcculloch said , adding that williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he was n't aiming at the police officers . investigators are not sure they `` buy '' williams ' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals , mcculloch said , but he did n't rule it out . `` it 's possible he was firing at someone else , '' he said , urging any other witnesses with information to come forward . the shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city 's police station shortly after midnight wednesday , at the end of a protest against the ferguson police department , st. louis county police chief jon belmar said at the time . officers saw `` muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away , '' belmar said . `` we could have buried two police officers , '' belmar told reporters last week . `` i feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was . '' public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices , belmar said . authorities offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers , according to the st. louis regional crimestoppers website . mcculloch said the tipster whose information led to williams ' arrest is eligible to receive the reward . protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting , and that the shots came from a grassy hill away from the crowd . `` in no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting , '' said antonio french , a st. louis alderman . belmar believes someone targeted the police , who have faced heated criticism for months , he said . `` these police officers were standing there , and they were shot just because they were police officers , '' he said . the department has been criticized since the shooting death of brown and , more recently , since a scathing u.s. department of justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city . police chief thomas jackson resigned wednesday . `` we are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment . we support peaceful protesting . however , we will not allow , nor tolerate , the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts , '' the mayor of ferguson and the city council said in a statement sunday . while many protesters have decried the ferguson police department , neither of the officers shot last week were from the city . one is from webster groves , a st. louis suburb 13 miles south of ferguson . the officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , belmar said . the other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back , belmar said . he is a 41-year-old officer with the st. louis county police department , who has been in law enforcement for 14 years . both men have been treated and released . cnn 's carma hassan , sara sidner , jason carroll , shimon prokupecz , evan perez and alina machado contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a sixth suspect in the shooting death of a top russian opposition figure blew himself up after a standoff with police in the capital of the chechen republic , state-run television reported sunday . beslan shavanov , 30 , was holed up in a building in grozny when police arrived to arrest him saturday afternoon , russia 24 reported . police surrounded the building and shavano tried to escape , throwing a grenade at police officers before blowing himself up , the station said . the news came as russian authorities reported making five other arrests in connection with boris nemtsov 's killing . one of those arrested claims to have an alibi , according to russia 's sputnik news . `` at the time of the murder , i was at work as i usually am every day . there are many people , my colleagues , who will confirm this , '' the news agency quoted tamerlan eskerkhanov as saying in moscow 's basmanny district court . two of the suspects have been formally charged and three `` remain under the status of suspects , '' court spokeswoman anna fadeyeva told sputnik . nemtsov , one of president vladimir putin 's most outspoken critics , was shot in the back on a moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the kremlin in late february . surveillance video showed someone darting from the sidewalk and into a nearby car right after nemtsov collapsed . putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with nemtsov 's death , russian media said , citing federal security service director alexander bortnikov . two of the other suspects are anzor gubashev and zaur dadayev , bortnikov said in a televised statement . the others are ramzan bakhayev and shagit gubashev , anzor 's younger brother , according to a sputnik report that also said dadayev was the only one of the five to plead guilty -- though to what crimes was not clear . bortnikov said those detained are from the southern region of the north caucasus , which for years has been a hotbed of unrest and rebellion against moscow . dadayev had previously served as an officer in a chechen police battalion , albert barakhayev , secretary of the security council of the caucasian republic of ingushetia , told the official news agency tass . dadayev was the deputy commander of one of the chechen republic 's ministry of internal affairs groups , sputnik reported , adding that gubashev worked at a security firm in moscow . gubashev was arrested between the town of malgobek and the village of voznesenovskaya , while dadayev was arrested in the city of magas , barakhayev told tass . the slain opposition leader 's daughter , zhanna nemtsova , told cnn she is `` not surprised both of them -lrb- are -rrb- of caucasus origin . it was predictable . '' nemtsova said the only things she knew about the arrests came from media reports , as authorities did not contact her immediately . later saturday , a southern russian law enforcement official told state news agency ria novosti that two more men were arrested . the two suspects in the second arrest were not named , but one of them was driving with dadayev , and the other man is gubashev 's younger brother , barakhayev said . like gubashev and dadayev , those two suspects are also ethnic chechens , according to barakhayev . after nemtsov 's shooting putin blamed extremists and protesters who he said were trying to stir internal strife in russia . many opposition sympathizers and people close to nemtsov have pointed the finger at putin and the russian government he leads . they note that nemtsov -- the deputy prime minister under former president boris yeltsin -- is the latest in a list of putin 's opponents who have been killed or imprisoned . nemtsov had also been arrested several times for speaking against the government . in her first tv interview since her father 's death , nemtsova told cnn that putin shares `` political responsibility '' for her father 's assassination . she spoke from germany . `` i do n't believe in the official investigation , '' she said saturday . other opposition figures previously jailed or killed include anna politkovskaya , a journalist critical of russia 's war in chechnya . she was gunned down at the entrance to her moscow apartment in 2006 . there was also business magnate mikhail khodorkovsky , who backed an opposition party and accused putin of corruption . khodorkovsky landed in jail after a conviction on tax fraud , which he said was a ploy to take away his oil company . the government rejected the claim . putin pardoned him in 2013 . former russian security agent alexander litvinenko was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium , his tea spiked in a london hotel during a meeting with two former russian security service men in 2006 . he had blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to russia 's invasion of chechnya later that year . the kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it or its agents are targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths . cnn 's catherine shoichet , ben brumfield , elena sandyrev , brian walker , greg botelho , joshua berlinger and alla eshchenko contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous . my job is to ask tough questions , but when it comes to faith , god , and religion , the more questions i ask in my quest for truth and understanding , the more complex the answers become . i was a bit of a rebellious child . my mom might tell you differently , but i never saw that as a bad trait . i felt that if i questioned authority , fought for the underdog , battled for the things that people told me were impossible , i would be different . change the world maybe . that same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me , like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that i would rather not put in print . that 's when i `` found god . '' i became a `` born-again '' christian when i attended a young life camp in high school . my home life was n't exactly going swimmingly , and this group really embraced me . i loved the christian notion of community , giving back , praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk , smoking pot and having sex . i opened my arms to jesus and fully embraced christian morals and principles . i decided that i was going to be `` that good girl '' and go on to do great things . i started off at westmont , a beautiful christian college nestled in the heart of santa barbara , california . what a safe place that was . it was also extremely nurturing . the professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development , and regularly prayed with us . my peer group was all about what ministry you signed up for , not what sorority you were rushing . we lifted each other up , had intimate sunrise bible studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends , talking about how to lead a godly life . as glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared , two years into college , the world became much larger to me . more complex , diverse , intellectually and spiritually challenging . it became the world of church , religion and faith versus the world of ideas , cultures , and philosophies . i found myself more drawn to carl jung than the book of corinthians . a good friend gave me a book , the myth of certainty . it posed these questions : . `` do you ever feel somewhat schizophrenic about the relationship of your faith to the rest of your life ? do you find yourself compartmentalizing different aspects so that tensions between them are minimized ? '' the answer to all of these for me was : yes . i started to read a lot . i wanted to mesh with a myriad of thinkers , and religious scholars . i needed to make a change . i left westmont after my sophomore year and transferred to usc 's school of journalism . i discovered i had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry , but i felt good about this transition . to me , it made perfect sense , because like ministers , true journalists love people , listen well and want to make a difference within this universe . meet the friendly atheists next door . the key difference is , in journalism , if we gather the `` facts , '' we can usually find the answers to what we 're looking for . when it comes to god , jesus and the holy spirit , those answers rest in faith . as a journalist , i seek intellectual certainty . when it came to my faith , i felt intellectually embarrassed . there was so much i just could n't explain . when i started working on a documentary about the growth of atheism , i found myself in a profound place of reflection . in the days when i thought i was going to pursue a life of ministry , i experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable . what was that ? god ? a higher power ? energy ? or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life ? there is no way to know . my stepfather , who grew up in -- but later left -- the mormon church has a perspective on religion that i find intriguing . he does n't believe in a god with a long white beard and flowing robes who sits upon a cloud guiding our daily lives . that concept is too abstract . but while he may not embrace `` god-liness , '' he does believe in `` good-liness . '' god , he told me in one of our many colorful spiritual discussions , is the `` good '' in humankind . he and i definitely agree that the concept of god should not be dismissed as having no meaning . to the contrary , it has a very important meaning , for it refers in symbolic language to the highest dimension of human existence , our spirituality . after years of spiritual reflection and inquiry , i am at a place where i do n't want to feel guilty , hypocritical , judgmental , closed-minded or arrogant . so , where do i stand now -- 30 years after `` finding god , '' questioning my faith , committing sins , seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability ? i am a `` seeker . '' a constant seeker within this world , among people and , of course , for spiritual enlightenment of all kind . because if i did possess the truth -- the `` final answer '' -- i am convinced i would spend the rest of my years missing out on the enrichment and surprise of seeking it . i guess i just love my exhilarating and torturous life .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- denmark has slammed as `` unacceptable '' comments by russia 's envoy to denmark that joining nato 's missile defense shield would make danish warships `` targets for russian nuclear missiles . '' in august last year , denmark said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to nato 's missile defense shield . in an opinion article published in the danish newspaper jyllands posten on saturday , russian ambassador mikhail vanin said he did not think the danes fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield . `` if this happens , danish warships become targets for russian nuclear missiles , '' he wrote . denmark 's minister for foreign affairs martin lidegaard said vanin 's remarks were unacceptable . `` russia knows full well that nato 's missile defense is defensive and not targeted at them -lrb- russia -rrb- , '' lidegaard said . `` however , i would not over-dramatize this . right now we disagree with russia on many important issues , but we also cooperate , for example , in the arctic and it is important that the tone between us does not escalate . we certainly are not contributing to that . '' tensions between russia and nato member countries have been mounting since russia 's annexation of crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern ukraine . moscow has repeatedly denied its military is involved . in april 2014 , nato foreign ministers said they had `` decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between nato and russia '' over the issue . the united states and nato allies have been conducting military exercises as part of `` operation atlantic resolve , '' which the united states describes as `` a demonstration of our continued commitment to the collective security of nato and dedication to the enduring peace and stability in the region , in light of the russian intervention in ukraine specifically . '' on march 2 , nato deputy secretary general alexander vershbow told the alliance 's annual meeting on arms control : `` russia 's illegal annexation of crimea and its continuing destabilization of eastern ukraine have put the european security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain . '' last monday , state-run russian media reported that russian president vladimir putin had ordered his northern fleet `` to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise '' in the arctic . at least one russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the `` international situation . '' conversely , deputy foreign minister alexey meshkov told tass news agency that russia was `` deeply concerned '' about nato drills near its border . nato says the long-term goal of its missile shield is `` to merge individual allies ' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system , providing full protection for nato european populations , territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a lawsuit that 's stirring concern among drinkers of some california wine starts with a history lesson . the deaths of napoleon bonaparte , simon bolivar , king george iii , king faisal i and other prominent figures have been attributed to arsenic poisoning , the first paragraph of the 30-page complaint says . and , now , drinkers of some california wine have become `` unwitting ` guinea pigs ' of arsenic exposure , '' thanks to the negligent and misleading actions of dozens of california wineries , according to the class action complaint filed march 19 on behalf of two california couples . the lawsuit does not include any allegations of physical injury or death due to arsenic consumption associated with drinking the wines named in the complaint . the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order requiring the defendants disclose on the bottles the risks of consuming inorganic arsenic in wines and engage in `` corrective advertising '' regarding their conduct . news of the lawsuit , which broke last week , struck fear in the hearts of frugal wine consumers nationwide , prompting many to share lists on social media of labels named in the lawsuit , all but declaring the outcome a foregone conclusion . the complaint names 28 companies that represent 83 low-cost labels familiar to supermarket wine aisle shoppers : cupcake , franzia , flipflop , rex goliath and korbel , among others . even the maker of trader joe 's charles shaw zinfandel varietal -lrb- affectionately known among fans as `` two-buck chuck '' -rrb- , was called out for allegedly failing to warn consumers that it contained `` dangerously '' high levels of inorganic arsenic . but should consumers start looking to other winemakers or other wine-producing states for gallon-sized bottles of zinfandel ? or is the lawsuit a fearmongering tactic being used to drum up business for the beverage-testing company used for the lawsuit , as some defendants and industry insiders have insinuated ? most of the defendants said their wine was safe to drink when contacted by cnn . some declined to comment , citing the pending litigation . others referred cnn to the wine institute , a california trade group that called the claims `` false and misleading . '' `` we are concerned that the irresponsible publicity campaign by the litigating party could scare the public into thinking that wine is not safe to consume , which is patently untrue , '' said the group , which represents 1,000 california wineries , including 10 of the defendants . the lawsuit alleges that three separate labs `` skilled in arsenic testing '' independently confirmed that the defendants produce wines containing `` dangerously '' high levels of inorganic arsenic , in some cases up to 500 % more than what is considered acceptable . `` put differently , '' the complaint states in bold letters , `` just a glass or two of these arsenic-contaminated wines a day over time could result in dangerous arsenic toxicity to the consumer . '' a spokesman from the public relations firm representing the plaintiffs and beveragegrades , which performed the analysis , said the company is confident that its data is `` based on sound scientific research . '' because the company expects testing methodology to be at issue in litigation , it declined to reveal specific data or testing methods . `` we understand the public interest in this story and look forward to resolving the litigation to make these products safer for consumers . and we hope the winemakers will take these findings just as seriously and work to make sure their wines are safe , '' spokesman rob feldman said . without seeing the lab results , experts suggest reserving judgment based on the following issues to arise from the lawsuit : . arsenic is found in air , soil and water throughout the world . therefore , it can also found in grains , fruits , vegetables and seafood due to absorption through soil and water . `` plants take up trace amounts of arsenic from the soil , and we have been ingesting these trace amounts for all of human history . generally , these amounts are at levels well below that associated with either acute or chronic toxicity , '' said cornell university 's gavin lavi sacks , director of undergraduate studies for the viticulture and enology program in the college of agricultural and life sciences . arsenic occurs in inorganic and organic forms . the fda describes organic or naturally occurring arsenic as `` essentially harmless . '' inorganic arsenic has been classified as a human carcinogen by the environmental protection agency . the first time the u.s. food and drug administration set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink was in 2013 , when it proposed to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic in apple juice to 10 parts per billion . long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic , mainly through smoking , drinking contaminated water , eating food prepared with contaminated water or eating food irrigated with arsenic-rich water , can lead to health risks such as cancer and skin lesions . according to the lawsuit , inorganic arsenic makes up the `` overwhelming majority '' of arsenic in wines at issue , despite the winemakers ' ability to limit inorganic arsenic through `` responsible winemaking procedures '' and `` sophisticated testing equipment . '' without providing specific data , the plaintiffs said their analysis found inorganic arsenic `` far in excess '' of what 's allowed in drinking water based on the epa 's standard for arsenic in drinking water : 10 parts per billion . but the epa limit for water is based on total arsenic , including both organic and inorganic forms , leading some to question whether it 's the best basis for comparison . this standard is set to protect consumers served by public water systems from the effects of long-term , chronic exposure to arsenic , epa spokeswoman tara johnson said in an email . it 's based on how much water people typically drink daily , which ranges from one to two liters , she said . however , the epa standard for arsenic in drinking water `` is of limited use when considering any potential health risks related to arsenic in wine , '' fda spokeswoman lauren sucher said in an email to cnn . `` people drink far more water than they do wine over their lifetimes , and they start drinking water earlier in life . thus , both the amount and period of exposure are different and would require separate analyses , '' she said . seeing as the usda recommends drinking about 10 cups of water a day and no more than two alcoholic drinks -lrb- about 1 cup of wine -rrb- a day , `` a sensible concentration limit for arsenic in wine should be at least 10-fold higher than for drinking water , and possibly higher , since we also use water for cooking and cleaning , '' sacks of cornell university said . this is roughly the case in countries that have established limits for arsenic in wine , which leads to the next point : . the u.s. tax and trade bureau regulates the production of alcoholic beverages , and part of this process is testing wine for arsenic , said erika holmes , spokeswoman for washington state university 's viticulture and enology school . even though the fda has not established a standard for acceptable levels of arsenic in wine , california wine exports are tested and found to be below the established limits for export , holmes said in an email . countries that import california wine also test for arsenic using their own standards : 100 parts per billion in canada and 200 parts per billion in europe -- 10 to 20 times higher than the drinking water limit in the united states . `` it 's certainly appropriate to look to other countries ' regulations for guidance , '' sacks said . `` their regulators are presumably looking at the same body of research that u.s. regulators would look to if they were to establish a mandatory limit for wine . '' the day cbs news aired a segment on the lawsuit , the company that performed the analysis sent out a news release offering its services to provide `` reassurance from arsenic in wine '' through `` a tool for screening their offerings to ensure the quality of their supply chain . '' neither beveragegrades nor its ceo , kevin hicks , is a party to the lawsuit . but hicks ' appearance in the segment prompted detractors to cry conflict of interest . in a statement to cnn , hicks said it was concerning that some winemakers would point to this as a conflict of interest `` instead of focusing on making sure their product contains the lowest amount of contaminants possible . '' he also defended his company 's right to offer its services to retailers , saying he will continue to do so . `` the arsenic data in my testing is based on years of scientific research and operating a commercial chemistry lab for over two years . as a commercial lab no one should be surprised that beveragegrades has been offering lab testing services to the alcohol beverage industry since july 2013 . '' a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the brand barefoot was a named defendant in the lawsuit . it is not . this story has been corrected . cnn sincerely regrets the error .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- when american writer avijit roy was hacked to death on a dhaka , bangladesh , street in full view of horrified onlookers , blogger washiqur rahman doubled down . fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation , he wrote . but they could n't silence it . his friends warned him to be careful , to watch what he posted online . but rahman dismissed those concerns , saying his facebook profile page did n't even bear his picture . they do n't even know what i look like , he told them . on monday , the 27-year-old rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed roy , hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency . he was so maimed -- with wounds to his head , face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying . his death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in dhaka for online posts critical of islam -- but they are hardly the only two who 've paid a steep price . in the last two years , several bloggers have died , either murdered or under mysterious circumstances . `` the despicable murder of avijit roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk . the killing of washiqur rahman today is another clear example of the bangladeshi government 's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk , '' said abbas faiz of amnesty international . `` how many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken ? '' as shocking as rahman 's death was , the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing . on his facebook page -lrb- for which he picked a custom url that translates to `` unbeliever '' -rrb- , rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag #iamavijit . after his death , someone left a comment , `` now you are . '' another wrote , `` i felt sorry when i first learned of your death . but then i saw what you wrote and i am not . '' on his page , rahman reposted a cartoon depicting prophet mohammed from the french satire magazine charlie hebdo . he wished a happy birthday to author taslima nasreen , who was forced to flee bangladesh due to death threats from fundamentalists . and he `` liked '' a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned , `` pigs in burqas . '' posts threatening him were numerous . `` get ready for the afterlife , '' one person commented on one of his posts . `` see you in hell , '' said another . he used to write under the pseudonym `` stupid man '' on a blog but switched to posting on facebook after 2011 . on facebook , he is credited for a series , `` jaw-crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists . '' there , he posted questions that critics of islam often raised and then answered them . but he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within islam . for example , one question asked what proof was there that the quran was the word of god . the answer , `` mohammed said in his own words that the quran is the word of god . since mohammed is the messenger of allah , his claims are true . '' he placed the question next to one that asked , `` what is the proof that mohammed was the messenger of allah ? '' the answer , `` the quran claims that mohammed was the messenger of allah . and since the quran is god 's word , its claims must be true . '' asif mohiuddin , a blogger who himself was wounded by machete-wielding attackers in 2013 but survived , remembered rahman as a great satirist . `` i named him the george carlin of bangladesh , '' he told the international humanist and ethical union . `` he wanted with all his heart , a true secular country , where everyone can practice their freedom . '' the irony is that the people who killed rahman were n't even familiar with his writings ; they were simply following orders , police said . of the three involved in the monday morning attack , two were quickly caught by bystanders . in confessions to police , the pair -- both students at islamic schools -- said they did n't know what a blog was , nor had they seen rahman 's writing . they said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing rahman was a religious duty , police commissioner biplob kumar sarkar told reporters . the third person is still to be apprehended . that appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in bangladesh . the only person arrested in the killing of roy , the u.s. blogger , is farabi shafiur rahman , who had called for his death in facebook posts . there has been no conviction in the january 2013 attack on mohiuddin . and no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger ahmed rajib haider , also in 2013 . `` the bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others , '' the committee to project journalists said after rahman 's death . `` otherwise the rest of the country 's bloggers , commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well . '' bloggers , unlike political parties , are n't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals , said imran sarker , who heads the blogger and online activists network in bangladesh . `` they want peace , they talk of humanity . if you strike them with stones , they do n't strike back . they try to reach you with flowers , '' he said . `` so , if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought , they are easy to pick on . '' but the deaths -- of rahman , of roy , of haider -- have emboldened the movement , rather than chill them into silence . `` no one is cowering in their homes because this is happening . because this has been happening regularly for a long time , '' he said . `` we want to take the society forward . we know we have a lot left to accomplish . '' cnn 's omar khan , kunal sehgal and ravi agrawal contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as a november dawn breaks over an irish bar in downtown new york , the early risers inside are hunkered down to watch lewis hamilton begin his chase for a second formula one world title . it 's mid-morning in brazil and melissa , her husband alex and their four-year-old daughter are also glued to the tv to watch their hero in the season-ending abu dhabi grand prix . on the verdant reunion island in the indian ocean , three thousand miles from the desert showdown , another hamilton fan anxiously waits for the mercedes man to race to his fate . these supporters , and others around the world from estonia to south africa , had voiced their hopes in video messages and their supplications on social media . when hamilton flicked down his visor , revved the mercedes ' engine and hit the throttle , a global surge of support roared . `` we came out at 6am on sunday morning to watch the race in a bar in manhattan , '' new yorker , and self confessed no. 1 hamilton fan , christopher thomas told cnn . `` we met up with fans from all over ; we had a guy from the uk and one guy even took a bus from boston just to watch the race . `` we also made videos and sent them to lewis ' website using the hashtag teamlh . '' in brazil , self-styled melissa `` hamilton , '' who is married to alex `` senna , '' also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol . she told cnn : `` i support lewis every day but during the races i am aware of everything , even practice and all the interviews . `` at all times he knows he can count on our support , in good times or bad . i am extremely proud to be a fan of his . '' when hamilton won in abu dhabi -- in easier circumstances than expected thanks to an engine problem for rival nico rosberg -- and sealed the 2014 championship he was quick to thank his fans in the post-race media conference . `` i always say we win and lose together , '' he smiled . `` the love and energy that i get from my fans ... it really made me believe that i can do anything . '' racing in a global championship has helped hamilton gain fame across international borders . in 2015 , the f1 series will visit an air-mile clocking 20 countries . but when the 30-year-old briton lines up for sunday 's season-opening australian grand prix , he will do so as the most famous face on the grid . `` lewis has over three million facebook fans -- with a third of those coming from the uk -- and he has 2.6 million twitter followers , '' explained jon stainer , managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company repucom . `` he has a very strong following . compared to other f1 drivers , lewis is also right up there in most of the sport 's key markets in terms of celebrity awareness . `` in the big markets -- brazil , china , india and the uk -- he scores in the top three . fernando alonso is the only other -lsb- ever-present -rsb- driver . '' tom roope , whose company rumpus room runs hamilton 's digital media , decided to tap into the racing star 's global appeal in the build-up to the sizzling abu dhabi finale . `` we saw that lewis ' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol #teamlh , '' explains roope . rumpus room then devised a real time app , which enabled them to record and upload video messages of support . these twin projects enabled roope and his team to have a better understanding of the geography and demographic of hamilton 's followers . `` his fanbase is enormously international , '' he said . `` around 50 % of them are from the uk but then there are a lot in asia , brazil and the u.s. 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries . `` there was also a surprisingly high female following , which is probably connected to -lsb- his former girlfriend popstar -rsb- nicole scherzinger . '' the video messages was then edited into four films , which were broadcast daily on hamilton 's social platforms over the race weekend . the final film on race day had a million views on facebook in one day alone . our story . here it is . #teamlhmovie . thank you all so much #teamlh @mercedesamgf1 . https://t.co/hbuit4jrrw . hamilton himself explained the concept , and the emotional response it generated within him , after the race . `` this weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people , '' he said . `` i really did n't know what to expect . when i got it there was something happening in my heart . i ca n't really explain it . '' thomas and his fiancée julliana sanchez , as well as melissa and her family and the reunion island fan , were featured in the films . `` it was important to us personally , '' thomas said . `` it 's a big deal for us making a video and seeing him acknowledge his fans . '' thomas , who is originally from guyana in south america , has also been galvanizing global support for hamilton through social media for the last five years . he explained : `` the idea percolated at the canadian grand prix in 2010 . my brother-in-law shaka had a huge painted banner -- it looked like something a five-year-old did -- but at the bottom it said ' #lewisnation -- we believe . ' `` we started using it and twitter was soon blown up with #lewisnation . the initial idea was to unite crew members in north america but when i go on twitter and facebook i see people from india , the philippines , the uk and germany . `` it 's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger . right now , we use #lewisnation to meet up at races but we 've started work on a website . '' hamilton 's mass appeal is not just because he 's an f1 driver and now a double world champion . he has something the other 17 drivers simply do n't have -- a narrative to rival a bestselling novel , a blockbuster script . born in stevenage , a commuter town 30 miles north of london , he broke boundaries when he debuted in 2007 as f1 's first black driver . he revealed on his website when his career began he `` tried to ignore that fact '' but has now `` really started to appreciate the implications . '' hamilton 's mixed heritage -- his mother is white british and his father 's family have roots in the caribbean -- and a rags-to-riches success story have both helped him connect with a wider fanbase . `` there 's a crossover that appeals to many , many backgrounds , '' said thomas . `` he 's diverse , but not just -lsb- in -rsb- race but in his social likings too . `` he hangs out with top celebrities like jay-z and kanye west . this hip-hop style and the fact that he spends a lot of time in the u.s. make him one of the few drivers who actually appeals to americans . '' roope agreed : `` lewis is a bit different . he invites a whole new set of people into f1 , people who might be put off by the rich , white , middle-classness of it all . '' hamilton has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates -- and an on-off romance with scherzinger . there have been some mesmerizing moments on track , and some famous meltdowns off it . perhaps most remembered was his outburst at the 2011 monaco grand prix . hamilton had been penalized by race stewards after finishing sixth and exclaimed to the media : `` it 's an absolute frickin ' joke . maybe it 's because i 'm black . that 's what ali g says . '' many of hamilton 's fans -- though not all -- warm to these moments of human frailty as much as his derring-do on the racetrack , and draw inspiration from both . melissa races go karts in brazil and , although she credits her husband alex for his practical support , she also takes heart from hamilton . `` lewis is a fighter , he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream ; he teaches us that , '' melissa explained . `` in addition to his talent as a wonderful driver , he has a big heart , a great willpower . `` many friends are astonished to see me kart racing because i dispute championships with many men , and women on the track are in the minority . `` i win often but women suffer some kind of prejudice . i do not really care , i care to always do my best and be inspired by the best drivers . '' melissa has met hamilton at many brazilian grands prix . `` all my meetings with lewis are fantastic and happy . he is a charismatic and kind person . he really loves his fans . '' thomas , like melissa , has met hamilton `` tonnes of times '' in and around grand prix weekends . `` he seems like a down to earth guy , '' thomas revealed . `` he 's not one of those guys who signs an autograph and shoves it back to you . he actually talks and spends time with you . '' thomas and his fiancée sanchez are so impressed with the british racer that they graced him with a special honor . `` the first person we invited verbally to our wedding was lewis , '' thomas explained . `` we met him in the pit lane at the u.s. grand prix last year , he hung out with us , took selfies and we alluded to the fact that we were getting married and said ` hey you 're the first invite . ' `` we are trying to set a date around the summer break . we ca n't set the date on a race weekend ! '' being a global personality offers the ability to change people 's lives even in a small way but for hamilton , the relationship he has with his fans appears to be mutualistic . `` lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans , '' said roope . `` he always sees his fans as the core of his powerbase . '' when he drives out of the garage in australia , the world champion may be racing to end the season as no. 1 but he also carries the hearts and hopes of millions . does lewis hamilton have what it takes to transcend the track and become a global sporting superstar ? find out in part ii published on thursday .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- the justice department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against sen. robert menendez , a new jersey democrat , alleging he used his senate office to push the business interests of a democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts . people briefed on the case say attorney general eric holder has signed off on prosecutors ' request to proceed with charges , cnn first reported . an announcement could come within weeks . prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations . menendez told reporters friday night he has `` always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law . '' he added : `` and i am not going anywhere . '' menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he could n't answer questions at the news conference , held in newark . the case could pose a high-profile test of the justice department 's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers , having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the constitution 's speech and debate clause . the fbi and prosecutors from the justice department 's public integrity section , have pursued a variety of allegations against menendez , who has called the probe part of `` smear campaign '' against him . the government 's case centers on menendez 's relationship with salomon melgen , a florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter . melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with . related : fbi agents search office of florida doctor known as senator 's donor . investigators have focused in part on plane trips menendez took in 2010 to the dominican republic as a guest of melgen . in 2013 , after word of the federal investigation became public , menendez paid back melgen $ 58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an `` oversight . '' menendez said he has been friends with melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together . one of the highest ranking hispanic members of congress , menendez is a former chairman of the senate foreign relations committee . he has become one of the obama administration 's most vocal democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- president obama 's decision to ease the trade embargo against cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with iran over that country 's nuclear program . menendez advocated on melgen 's behalf with federal medicare administrators who accused melgen of overbilling the government 's healthcare program , according to court documents and people briefed on the probe . melgen was among the top recipients of medicare reimbursements in recent years , during a time when he was also a major democratic donor . melgen 's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing . prosecutors also are focusing on whether menendez broke the law in advocating for melgen 's business interest in a dominican republic government contract for a port screening equipment . the u.s. customs and border protection agency , at the time , considered donating port screening equipment to the dominican republic , which would have hurt the contract of melgen-controlled company . menendez , now serving his second full term as senator , led the democratic senatorial campaign committee from 2009-2011 . during a senate subcommittee hearing in 2012 , menendez did n't mention icssi , melgen 's company , by name , but he did press deputy assistant secretary of state matthew rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to x-ray cargo that went through all dominican ports -- a contract that , he said , dominican authorities `` do n't want to live by . '' `` if those countries can get away with that , they will , '' the senator said . `` and that puts american companies at a tremendous disadvantage . '' menendez 's office said at the time the senator 's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region . other lines of inquiry against menendez had included allegations he solicited prostitutes in the dominican republic , and that he violated the law helping win permanent u.s. residency for two ecuadorian banking magnates , the isaias brothers . the prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story , and the fbi did n't find evidence of wrongdoing in the isaias matter , according to people briefed on the probe . the fbi probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government , menendez and his former aides . last week , the third circuit court of appeals briefly posted , apparently by accident , documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use . the documents were quickly put back under seal , but not before a reporter with the new jersey law journal secured a copy and later published a story . according to the documents , menendez 's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of congress in carrying out their duties . the speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of congress about `` legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts . '' the fight centers in part on the justice department 's attempt to compel testimony from menendez 's aides , some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury . according to the documents , the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on melgen 's fight with the center for medicare and medicaid services , a federal agency . among these is a meeting among mendedez , sen. harry reid and then health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius . the government is also pushing to use emails between menendez 's office and a cbp official about the dominican ports issue . a federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from menendez 's aides , but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing . `` the parties primarily dispute the legislative character of senator menendez 's two conversations with -lsb- then acting cms administrator marilyn -rsb- tavenner and his meeting with secretary sebelius , '' the appeals court said . `` these communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials , one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the united states senate . ''
sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. military has pulled its remaining personnel out of yemen due to the deteriorating security situation , the u.s. state department said . the evacuation involved about 100 special operations forces members from the al anad airbase , sources in the region familiar with the situation told cnn . the state department called it a temporary relocation . those evacuated , which include navy seals and members of the army 's delta force , were the last american forces stationed in the arab nation , which is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , the terrorist group also known as aqap . `` we ... continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from yemen and have capabilities postured in the area to address them , '' state department spokesman jeff rathke said late saturday . `` as we have in the past , we will take action to disrupt continuing , imminent threats to the united states and our citizens . '' the united states closed its embassy in sanaa last month , after houthi rebels took over the yemeni capital . and hundreds of al qaeda members escaped two yemeni prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions . `` there is no military solution to yemen 's current crisis , '' jeff rathke said . `` we urge the immediate cessation of all unilateral and offensive military actions . '' the united nations is taking the situation seriously . the security council will meet at 3 p.m. et sunday to discuss yemen , the french mission said saturday via twitter . for years , the u.s. military has worked closely with yemen 's government to go after aqap , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al qaeda figure anwar al-awlaki . and u.s. president barack obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign . `` yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , '' obama said in january , promoting the policy of `` partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government '' as the best approach in a bad situation . `` the alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , '' the president said . but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by yemen 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace . these include the rise of the houthis , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president abdu rabu mansour hadi and the presence of not only al qaeda fighters but other militants . on friday , for instance , isis purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in sanaa what , if true , would mark that group 's first large-scale attack in yemen . the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried isis proclamations , but could n't be immediately authenticated by cnn . those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to yemen 's state-run saba news agency . while isis and al qaeda are both sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of islam and violent opposition to the west , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon . in fact , aqap strongly rebuked isis in a video released in november , characterizing its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's declaration of an islamic caliphate as illegitimate . more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the islamic state violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there . with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the west -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over . meanwhile , the main players for control of yemen 's government -- those siding with hadi , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the houthis , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds . just two days ago , a yemeni jet commanded by the capital 's houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden . no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides . the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemeni military forces -- some under the houthis , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , said aden gov. abdulaziz hobtour . at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to hobtour . hadi took to the airwaves of adan tv , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest . he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the saudi capital of riyadh , condemning the aden strike and urging yemeni troops to refuse orders from houthi officials . hadi tied the houthis to iran , which he was said supported the `` coup '' that led to his departure from aden . `` the iranian agenda of the houthis will not last , '' he said . after hadi spoke , the houthi-run saba news agency responded , saying the supreme revolutionary committee has decided to mobilize forces and `` directed security and military institutions to carry out their duties to confront -lrb- the -rrb- dirty war . '' `` the committee announces the decision to call proud sons of the yemeni people in all regions to unite , collaborate and cooperate with members of the armed and security forces in the face of terrorist forces in all parts of the country , '' the report said . mohammed al bukhaiti , a top member of the houthi political council , said hadi 's speech wo n't help yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power . `` we blame hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved yemen 's ongoing crises , '' al bukhaiti said . `` hadi will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- jeremy clarkson wo n't have his contract renewed as host of `` top gear '' after he apparently busted his producer 's lip and verbally abused him , the bbc announced wednesday . clarkson , who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world , was suspended on march 10 after what the british broadcaster previously described as a `` fracas '' with producer oisin tymon on march 4 . wednesday , the bbc released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident . ken macquarrie , who conducted the investigation , said tymon had been `` subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by jeremy clarkson '' at a hotel in north yorkshire after a day of filming . `` during the physical attack oisin tymon was struck , resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip , '' he said . the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , macquarrie said , but clarkson continued to use `` derogatory and abusive language '' for a sustained period of time . macquarrie said clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to bbc management . bbc director general tony hall issued a statement announcing clarkson was being dropped . `` a member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to accident and emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature . for me a line has been crossed , '' he said . `` i know how popular the program is and i also know that this decision will divide opinion . '' `` top gear , '' fronted by clarkson , james may and richard hammond , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it . clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns . in his statement , hall referenced the bbc 's diversity , saying it was `` a broad church . '' `` we need distinctive and different voices but they can not come at any price . common to all at the bbc have to be standards of decency and respect , '' he said . north yorkshire police issued a statement wednesday saying they had asked for the bbc 's report on the incident . `` the information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by north yorkshire police where necessary , '' they said . on march 10 , the bbc announced that `` top gear 's '' march 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live `` top gear '' shows scheduled for next week in stavanger , norway . however , it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would `` run as scheduled . '' hall said the bbc would `` look to renew ` top gear ' for 2016 '' and that he had asked bbc controller kim shillinglaw to `` look at how we put out the last programs in the current series . '' after his suspension by the bbc , clarkson changed his twitter profile to `` i am probably a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear . '' on wednesday , the wording became past tense : `` i used to be a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear . '' co-host richard hammond tweeted : `` gutted at such a sad end to an era . we 're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it 's been an incredible ride together . '' fans had earlier expressed outrage at the bbc decision to suspend clarkson . even media baron rupert murdoch commented on speculation that clarkson would be sacked , posting a tweet tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a `` funny man with great expertise . '' an online petition to have clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people . fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired . last week , a fan dressed as the `` stig '' -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the bbc 's london headquarters in an armored tank to present the `` bring back clarkson '' petition . clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times . according to the bbc website , clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism . it also adds : `` terrifyingly , he might just be the most influential man in motoring . '' clarkson has been at the helm of the program since 1998 , and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with hammond and may . the trio 's long-distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status . in 2013 , guinness world records named `` top gear '' the world 's most widely watched factual program , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide . local versions have been made in the united states , china , russia , australia and south korea . while clarkson 's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers , his on - and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense . last year , he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that was n't aired . `` i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure . i was mortified by this , horrified . it is a word i loathe , '' clarkson said in video statement posted online . he 's been accused on other occasions of racism , including characterizing mexicans as `` lazy and feckless '' and using the word `` slope '' over footage of an asian man crossing a bridge during a `` top gear '' special in myanmar . producer andy wilman later apologized , calling it a `` light-hearted word play joke , '' and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to asians . last week , clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north london , verbally attacking his bbc bosses . a cnn reporter who was at the event said clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc had `` f**ked themselves '' and had ruined a great show . clarkson later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant `` in jest '' and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the `` top gear '' race track . cnn 's rosie tomkins and journalist monica sarkar contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- everywhere you look there are two-wheeled drivers waiting ominously for passengers to hop on board . they 're the backbone of public transport in uganda and the fastest way to get around the capital city , kampala . the boda boda motorbike taxi is a staple used by all sectors of society . traditionally , the usual way of catching a ride was to venture into any street corner packed with tens of boda bodas or simply waiting for one to pass by . but now , a new local startup are bringing this classic mode of transport into the technological age by providing the ability to hail a boda boda at the click of a smartphone . `` bodas are the main thing getting people from a to b , '' says alastair sussock , co-founder of safeboda , `` and we 're trying to professionalize this transportation in the city . '' the motorbike taxis have their greatest popularity globally in uganda , with over 80,000 riding the streets of kampala , according to sussex who wants to seize upon the country 's burgeoning young population . uganda has more than 24 % of the population aged between 10 and 19 years old , according to unicef -- and sussock wants them to get on their bikes . `` young people use smartphones in kampala and it 's one of the youngest countries in the world , '' he says . for now , the uber-like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of kampala , where a click on the safeboda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a safeboda bike , complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket , helmet and fully trained in road safety . he 'll even have a helmet for you . safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in kampala . a study conducted at mulago national referral hospital in kampala , by researchers at makerere university , identified approximately 40 % of trauma cases at the hospital to be due to boda-boda accidents . i request a safeboda to take me to meet the team in the upmarket area of kisementi , in kampala 's central district . as i stand waiting , at least 10 regular boda bodas pass by beeping to get my attention and business . a driver called richard lalunga then arrives who i spot clearly in the distance thanks to his bright orange jacket and orange helmets -- one on his head and one on his handlebars . lalunga has been a boda driver for four years and joined safeboda four months ago to learn more about road safety . he explains how he now earns more than ever before due to a loyal customer base stemming from his safe driving . the ride was in fact calmer than those taken with other bodas , and unlike some , as we ride along the congested streets no kerbs were scaled or mounted to avoid the traffic . the name stands - safeboda . the dangers lie in the low use of helmets -- by both drivers and users -- alongside risky driving and poor road safety practices . this makes many fearful of catching a two-wheeled ride but the team at safeboda are trying to lure people back on board . they 're reinventing the boda boda reputation to prove they can be safe , as well as fast and economical . `` it 's a market-based approach to road safety , '' says sussock , an economist , who believes that as word spreads about the skills of his drivers , the income -- and safety -- of his drivers will rise and reflect this . `` people in uganda do n't wear helmets , '' says sussock . `` so how do we get them to wear helmets ? '' the answer , is by providing one . driver training is provided in partnership with the ugandan red cross and takes place for up to three weeks to cover road safety and bike maintenance -- and it seems to be working . since its inception in november 2014 , the fleet of drivers at safeboda has reached 50 , currently occupying four areas towards the north and center of the city . the main need for safe driving is in the congested streets of downtown kampala where the company plans to expand into next . `` if we train people and make them good and responsible drivers , we 're going to save lives , '' says ricky rapa thomson , who manages the drivers . `` but implementing has been a challenge , '' he says about the difficulties in changing the mindsets of a population . the team are dreaming big , with plans to expand to 100 by the end of march and 800 by the end of 2015 . `` with over 1,000 drivers we can begin to change the entire boda industry , '' says sussock . more from african start-up . read this : bike tour gives taste of township life . read this : this ` eco stove ' does more than cook your dinner . editor 's note : every week , african start-up follows entrepreneurs in various countries across the continent to see how they are working to make their business dreams become reality . follow the show on twitter .
dusseldorf , germany -lrb- cnn -rrb- years before he was at the controls of a germanwings plane that plunged into the french alps , andreas lubitz told the airline he worked for that he 'd had a bout with depression . lubitz , the co-pilot of germanwings flight 9525 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane , told his lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a `` previous episode of severe depression , '' the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , knew of lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . lufthansa , whose ceo previously said lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a `` swift and seamless clarification '' and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . what was mental state of germanwings co-pilot ? it 's a development that will likely be a part of the crash investigation , but it 's only one piece of the puzzle , cnn aviation correspondent richard quest said . `` we need to know what happened after he returned in 2009 and finished his training , because that tells us whether there was the correct procedure and process , '' he said . a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and `` held all the licenses required . '' check out the latest from our correspondents . the details about lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf said lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career . medical records reveal that lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license , prosecutor 's spokesman christoph kumpa said . kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a european government official briefed on the investigation into last week 's crash told cnn on tuesday . while flying was `` a big part of his life , '' the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the european government official said . lubitz told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work , the official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said brian russell , a forensic psychologist . `` psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , '' he said . `` but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems . '' reports say a cell phone video shows the nightmarish final seconds of germanwings flight 9525 , but a police spokesman said the accounts were `` completely wrong . '' french magazine paris match and german newspaper bild reported that a video recovered from a phone at the wreckage site showed the inside of the plane moments before it crashed . `` one can hear cries of ` my god ' in several languages , '' paris match reported . `` metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . then nothing . '' the two publications described the video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications reported that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . `` it is a very disturbing scene , '' said julian reichelt , editor-in-chief of bild online . an official with france 's accident investigation agency , the bea , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. jean-marc menichini , a french gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the germanwings crash site , told cnn that the reports were `` completely wrong '' and `` unwarranted . '' cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they `` had n't been exploited yet . '' menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in rosny sous-bois , near paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , menichini said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , menichini answered with a categorical `` no . '' reichelt told `` erin burnett : outfront '' that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying bild and paris match are `` very confident '' that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports . `` that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , '' he said . while investigators search for clues to lubitz 's motivation , recovery workers continue the grim task of searching for the remains of those killed in the march 24 crash . the remains of at least 78 people on board the plane have been identified so far using dna analysis . naffrechoux warned monday that `` it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers , as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash . '' but french president francois hollande , speaking alongside german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , was more positive , saying that it should be possible to identify all the victims by the end of the week . a simple stone memorial has been set up at le vernet , where grieving relatives of those killed have laid flowers and held prayers . germanwings crash compensation : what we know . who was the captain of germanwings flight 9525 ? the bea , france 's accident investigation agency , said its ongoing safety investigation was focusing on a more detailed analysis of the flight history leading up to the crash , based on the audio recovered from the cockpit voice recorder and any other available data . `` a deliberate act by a man with a disturbed psychological profile is a possible scenario , '' bea spokeswoman martine del bono told cnn . `` the first step of the investigation is to describe more precisely what happened . '' this will be based mainly on analysis of the cockpit voice recorder , to be supplemented by data from the flight data recorder if it is found , she said . `` but we will also look at other events with possibly similar scenarios , try to understand if there are systemic weaknesses which may contribute or facilitate such scenarios . `` we will in particular look at the cockpit door locking as well as the criteria and procedures applied to detect specific psychological profiles .

boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- dzhokhar tsarnaev 's own words may determine whether he lives or dies , even if he never speaks a word at his trial . the admitted boston marathon bomber has sat in silence as people who lost limbs sobbed or glared at him from the witness stand . he slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail-packed pressure cooker bombs exploded , killing three people , claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others . he did n't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court . at issue : was tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the united states for policies he believed were harmful to muslims ? or , was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older , more radical brother ? the defense team tried to portray tsarnaev as a confused college kid who , like countless others , watches comedy central and cracks crass jokes . `` i wan na study a broad or two , '' he posted on his twitter account as @j_tsar . he jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the trix rabbit , and about `` whale watching '' outside a mcdonald 's fast-food restaurant . miriam conrad , a member of his defense team , tried tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would-be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise . his brother was dead and police knew who he was ; they were scouring the boston suburb of watertown for tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the slip away ii , a fishing boat dry-docked in a watertown backyard . he hid for hours before being discovered . bleeding , he picked up a pencil and wrote what assistant u.s. attorney william weinreb called his `` manifesto . '' tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother , tamerlan , had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior ; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police . the indictment against him says tsarnaev helped in his brother 's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police . about the bombings , tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he did n't enjoy killing innocent civilians , but that circumstances excused it . `` the us government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that , '' he wrote . `` know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven , now how can you compete with that . we are promised victory and we will surely get it . '' streaks of blood cover portions of his message . more than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words . so ended one of the biggest manhunts in u.s. history . while in the boat , he wrote that he could n't stand to see the u.s. government `` go unpunished '' for killing muslims . `` we muslims are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all . '' he ended with : `` now i do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in islam but due to said '' -- the word was lost to a bullet hole -- `` it is allowed . '' tsarnaev 's connections : who 's who . judge george o'toole viewed the boat tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat `` in context '' to the jury . he turned down requests by the media to accompany him . the defense said the government only presented about 45 tweets out of about 1,100 . many were benign , about girls , cars and food as well as sleeping and disliking studying , the defense argued . on monday , fbi agent steven kimball testified about two twitter accounts used by tsarnaev . one account shows he tweeted on the day of the april 15 , 2013 , bombing : . `` ai n't no love in the heart of the city , stay safe people '' his last tweet was on april 17 . he sent it while on the run : . `` i 'm a stress free kind of guy '' his other account carried seven tweets , including this : . `` strive to be a better muslim , be greedy with your time , devote most of it to the almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need #islam '' the jury also has now seen tsarnaev in videos , trailing his brother onto boylston street . both carried heavy backpacks . he paused for four minutes , standing next to a tree in front of the forum restaurant . in front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race . he put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call . timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath . when his brother 's bomb went off a block away , heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise . and there was tsarnaev walking through the crowd , looking back over his shoulder as his own bomb went off 12 seconds later . martin richard , an 8-year-old standing in the line of kids , took the full brunt of the blast , which tore him apart . the bombs went off at 2:49 and 2:50 p.m. , about the same time as he exchanged phone calls with his brother . the next video showed tsarnaev in the crowd running . other videos show him carrying on as usual : buying milk and swiping his card at his college gym . but fbi agents were already in pursuit , collecting store security videos and looking for somebody suspicious in the marathon crowd . by wednesday night , authorities had a good idea who they were looking for . by thursday night , his photo had been released to the public . by the next morning , his brother was dead , and tsarnaev was hiding in the boat , writing of martyrdom and paradise .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- barring a revelation from his parents or girlfriend , we may never know what was going through the mind of andreas lubitz in the moments leading up to the crash of germanwings flight 9525 . what we now know is that all indications point to lubitz as the perpetrator of the crash , locking the pilot out of the cockpit and setting the aircraft on a fatal trajectory into a remote mountain range in the french alps . every day , more details come to light , as the world struggles to make sense of why a 27-year-old german man would apparently choose to deliberately crash a plane with 150 people on board , including himself -- and remain so calm while doing it . when investigators searched lubitz 's home in dusseldorf , they found medical leave notes `` slashed , '' suggesting lubitz was hiding an illness or illnesses from his employers . the dates for which lubitz was excused from work included the day of the crash , though investigators have not yet revealed the reason he was excused , if any reason was written on the notes by his doctor . we do know , from a german aviation source , that lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification examination last summer . an official with lufthansa , the parent company of the budget airline germanwings , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health . `` he was 100 % fit to fly without restrictions , '' lufthansa ceo carsten spohr told reporters at press conference last week . `` his flight performance was perfect . there was nothing to worry about . '' spohr added that lubitz had `` interrupted '' his training , which he began in 2008 . that break lasted several months , he said , but that such an interruption is n't uncommon . lubitz suffered from `` generalized anxiety disorder , '' with severe depression symptoms dating back to 2009 , according to french newspaper le parisien . while the main medical clinic in dusseldorf denies it was treating lubitz for depression , german investigators found antidepressant medications in lubitz 's apartment , according to published reports that cnn has not yet been able to independently confirm . die welt , a german newspaper , over the weekend cited an unidentified senior investigator , who said lubitz suffered from `` severe subjective burnout syndrome '' and severe depression . `` someone who has a significant depressive episode or depressive disorder will oftentimes get an antidepressant alone , and many times will have a good resolution of those symptoms , '' cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta told poppy harlow sunday on `` cnn newsroom . '' `` people who relapse or develop more of what is called a psychotic depression in addition may have symptoms of psychosis . maybe they could be having delusions or hallucinations , but the idea is having breaks with reality . '' one of the medications lubitz was prescribed is said to be agomelatine -lrb- an antidepressant medication -rrb- , according to le perisien . antidepressants can sometimes make people suicidal , especially those suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . other times , they can make patients manic or psychotic . the drug 's list of warnings and precautions include metabolic changes -- such as weight gain -- and the potential for cognitive and motor impairment . `` has potential to impair judgment , thinking and motor skills ; use caution when operating machinery . '' in 2010 , lubitz received olanzpine injections -lrb- an antipsychotic medication -rrb- `` to treat ocd , '' according to le perisien . doctors advised lubitz to be more active , practice a new sport and regain self-confidence . `` this is a powerful medication , '' said gupta . `` if this is true , it sort of reads into the severity of just how bad the psychosis was , at least at one point in his life . '' there are other things besides psychosis for which the drug may be administered , but that 's the most common use . one of the side effects is blurred vision . citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , the new york times saturday reported that lubitz sought treatment for vision problems that might have put his career at risk . if he was prescribed this medication as an injectable five years ago , was now taking it as an oral antipsychotic and was n't taking it because of it was causing these detrimental side effects , `` that could be very concerning , as well , '' said gupta . authorities have not ruled out that lubitz 's vision problem could have been psychosomatic . many people have been asking how likely it is that depression could result in this sort of horrific action . in a word : `` unlikely , '' says dr. charles raison , a professor of psychiatry at the university of arizona . `` most people would just kill themselves , '' he says . `` it 's very , very rare for depression to cause people to kill other people . this leads me to believe there 's something else going on , like a personality character flaw . '' forensic psychologist jeff gardere agrees . `` it has to be a very severe depression to the point that there 's a psychosis that 's a result of that depression , '' he says . `` that 's different than the schizophrenia part of psychosis . with this kind of depression , it 's so deep that you actually break with reality . '' remember , lubitz was in his late 20s -- and the odds of mental illness presenting at this age are much higher for someone in their 20s or 30s . `` sometimes people lose touch with reality slowly . other times , they lose touch really quickly , '' says raison . `` bipolar psychotic states can develop in as little as a day or two . i 'm most curious what was going on in this guy 's life the week before this happened . did anyone see any changes with his behavior ? did he stop sleeping ? there 's a pretty good chance something would come up in speaking with the people in his life . '' `` if a story does n't make sense , it means you do n't have the real story , '' says raison . `` even people who are psychotic will tell you a crazy story . it 's crazy , but it makes sense . '' more details are needed on lubitz 's story . perhaps the most chilling revelation so far is that lubitz not only decided to do what he did , but that he ignored the pilot 's pleas to think about the lives on board and change his mind . `` it tells you he 's at peace with what he 's doing , '' says raison . `` if you were uncertain or anxious , you might still open the cabin door -lrb- when the pilot was banging on the door and yelling to be let in -rrb- . calm determination to do this tells you he really believed in what he was doing . '' `` if you look at school shooters , they go into a dissociative state , '' says gardere . `` they 've been planning for quite some time . they go into this personality where they can calmly go into murder mode -- robotic and calm . even when they 're shooting or doing something rageful , they behave in a calm manner . -lrb- lubitz -rrb- knew when he got onto that plane that he was n't coming back . '' on monday , britain 's most senior psychiatrist told cnn 's christiane amanpour that when a pilot is `` acutely depressed or suffering from ... any mental illness '' that impairs his or her ability to fly , he or she can not fly an aircraft . `` we do n't let pilots fly with depression , not because we 're worried that they 're going to murder everybody on board . that 's such an extraordinary possibility that -- that 's not depression -- but because they 're impaired in concentration , memory and attention , which is n't good for a pilot , '' said sir simon wessely , president of the royal college of psychiatrists and an adviser to the british army . wessely added that the germanwings plane crash might open a discussion on `` relaxing the laws of -lrb- doctor-patient -rrb- confidentiality in different countries , '' though in the united kingdom , as well as in many other countries , a doctor is obliged to go to the authorities if he or she believes that people are genuinely being put at risk by one of their patients . cnn 's john bonifield contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the fbi has increased its reward for information on missing american robert levinson from $ 1 million to $ 5 million , it announced monday . levinson , a retired fbi agent , vanished after traveling to the iranian island of kish in march 2007 and is one of the longest-held u.s. citizens in history . the fbi announced the reward increase on the eighth anniversary of levinson 's disappearance -- and the day before his 67th birthday . `` levinson traveled to kish island , iran , on march 8 , 2007 , working on behalf of several large corporations , and his whereabouts , well-being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time , '' it said in a statement . u.s. secretary of state john kerry issued a statement asking iran to cooperate with the investigation into levinson 's whereabouts . `` he has spent more than 2,900 days separated from those who love him , and is one of the longest held u.s. citizens in history . year after year , the family has endured the pain of his absence . it is time for him to come home , '' kerry said . `` we remain committed to the safe return of mr. levinson to his family and appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners . we remain concerned about mr. levinson 's health given his age and the length of his disappearance . '' iran 's government repeatedly has said it is not holding levinson and does not know his whereabouts . the fbi says he was in iran as a private investigator . but news reports in 2013 said he was working as an independent cia contractor when he disappeared . that prompted his family to speak out , saying they kept it quiet for years that levinson was working for the cia , because the u.s. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy . the fbi , white house and cia have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the cia and levinson . it 's unclear exactly who is holding him , but u.s. officials have said they believe he is somewhere in southwest asia . whoever his captors are , in 2010 they sent a `` proof of life '' videotape and photographs of levinson to his family . in the video , he asked the u.s. government for help : `` please help me get home , '' a gaunt-looking levinson said on the tape , citing his 33 years of service in the fbi as a reason for that help . the photographs showed him with a large beard .
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- the ukrainian girlfriend of slain russian opposition leader boris nemtsov faces constant psychological pressure from moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death , her mother told cnn . model anna duritskaya , 23 , was walking with nemtsov on friday night when a gunman shot the politician about 100 meters -lrb- 330 feet -rrb- from the kremlin . `` she was crying and she was saying boris had been killed and he 's lying next to me , '' said her mother , inna duritskaya . `` she was in such shock she could n't say anything else . '' duritskaya said her daughter was questioned until 2 a.m. monday . she said she fears authorities will implicate her daughter in the death because they have threatened to take her attorney away from her . the model had been staying at the apartment of an aide to nemtsov under constant police guard . late monday , yevhen perebyinis , a spokesman for ukraine 's foreign ministry , tweeted that duritskaya had left moscow for kiev . the assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories . nemtsov was one of president vladimir putin 's most outspoken critics , and many suspect the kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement . inna duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader . `` of course when i heard she was dating him it was a bit of a shock , '' she said . `` then when i met him in person i liked him a lot as a person . he was straightforward , he treated my daughter very well , she was happy . and i could n't influence it anyway ; my daughter did what she wanted to . of course , i was worried and scared , but i could n't change it anyway . '' thousands of nemtsov supporters gathered sunday in moscow to mourn the death of the 55-year-old , who was deputy prime minister during president boris yeltsin 's administration . the event took place the same day nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in moscow decrying russia 's policies on ukraine . ukrainian president petro poroshenko said saturday that nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to russian interests , ukraine 's state-run ukrinform news agency reported . `` a few weeks ago i had a conversation with him on how to build relations between ukraine and russia , as we would like them to be , '' ukrinform quoted poroshenko as saying . `` boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the russian armed forces in ukraine . someone was very afraid of that . boris was not afraid , the executioners were afraid . they killed him . '' putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said . the president also wrote to nemtsov 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the kremlin said . police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches , russia 's sputnik news agency reported . the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater . the investigative committee of the russian federation is offering a reward of 3 million rubles -lrb- $ 49,000 -rrb- for information leading to the arrest of the killer . it said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity . on monday , the russian television station dozhd published an interview with anna duritskaya after her release . duritskaya told the interviewer she did not see who killed nemtsov , but that when she turned around she saw a light-colored car driving away . duritskaya said that her wish was to go home to ukraine to see her mother and that she did not believe she could attend nemtsov 's funeral on tuesday . speculation has pointed blame at everyone from putin , to a putin associate , to someone just irked by nemtsov 's business activities . `` i doubt it was a direct order from putin , but it was this toxic atmosphere of hatred , '' russian pro-democracy activist garry kasparov said . `` it has been propagated by russian television 24/7 . '' nemtsov 's friend and political colleague ilya yashin blamed putin more directly : `` it 's clearly a political murder , '' yashin said . `` i do n't know who killed boris , but i know that it 's the government and personally putin who are responsible for it . '' putin offered a different theory : that the killing was a contract hit , but one meant to fire up political strife , his spokesman dmitry peskov said . one man near the site of nemtsov 's memorial said he thinks the killer was a putin opponent . `` i do n't think putin did this , '' he told cnn . `` i think this was some radical group that wants to make putin look bad . '' nemtsov had said he was at risk for assassination . he told the russian newspaper sobesednik last month that he was `` a little bit '' afraid his mother 's fears that putin would have him killed would come true . but he added , `` i 'm not afraid of him that much . if i was afraid i would n't be heading an opposition party and do what i 'm doing . '' opinion : the complicated life and tragic death of boris nemtsov . critics of putin have in the past suffered miserable fates . last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russian journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya . business magnate mikhail khodorkovsky accused putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps . late last year , kremlin critic alexey navalny was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial . russia 's official news agency reported monday that a request by navalny to attend nemtsov 's funeral had been denied . and before his death , nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government . kasparov , chairman of the human rights foundation 's international council , suggested the killing was linked to the kremlin 's own insecurity . `` if you are popular your critics do n't have to be shot down in front of the kremlin , '' kasparov tweeted . `` putin is just food in a prison , eat it or starve .

new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- a mob , consisting of thousands of people , stormed a prison compound in india 's far northeast , dragging out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets on thursday , authorities say . police say they tried to stave off the mob with tear gas and opened fire , killing one person . the crowd targeted a 35-year-old suspect , identified as an undocumented bangladeshi settler , who died of his injuries before officers could rescue him , said l.l. doungal , the director-general of police in the remote nagaland state , where the attack took place . the mob that broke into the main jail in the state 's dimapur district was comprised of `` thousands '' of people , doungal told cnn . `` many of them were students in uniform , '' he said . the suspect was accused of raping a local woman on february 23 . tensions between the native naga and undocumented bangladeshi migrants in the district have been simmering for some time , police said . on thursday evening , thousands of people who were demanding the cancellation of trade permits for bengali-speaking settlers , tore into the prison complex and pulled the suspect out . police initially used tear gas and bamboo canes to rescue the inmate , but were not successful , doungal said . `` there were students in uniform . so , we had to use minimum force , '' he said . the crowd planned to lynch the suspect , but he died from critical injuries suffered in the attack . `` we retrieved his body before it could be -lrb- hanged -rrb- , '' doungal said . dimapur town has been placed under curfew , according to the officer , as the situation remains volatile .
kano , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- more than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in a series of suicide bombings in northern nigeria on saturday , witnesses and authorities told cnn . the blasts occurred in maiduguri , the capital of the tumultuous borno state , at the city 's main market , a fish market and a bus station . four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks , according to witnesses . no group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed . but the islamist extremist group boko haram has been behind many similar attacks in northern nigeria and beyond , killing hundreds in recent months as part of its terrorist campaign to bring its twisted version of sharia law to the region . clement adoda , a borno state police spokesman , said at least 54 people were killed and another 139 wounded in the suicide attacks . suleiman bulunkutu said he and others involved in the rescue operation had taken about 50 bodies to the maiduguri general hospital morgue . `` this toll does n't include those taken to three other hospitals , '' bulunkutu said . `` therefore , the final -lrb- death -rrb- toll may be higher . '' in the first blast , a woman dressed in a hijab got off a motorized rickshaw and blew herself up outside the baga road fish market around 11:20 a.m. -lrb- 5:20 a.m. et -rrb- , fish trader mohammed boni said . the next attack took place about an hour later outside monday market , the main one in the city , where people were lined up to go through security . those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of boko haram attacks in the city and region . two women joined the female security line , one of whom `` blew herself up , causing minimal casualty , '' said witness abdulkarim musa . then , as people gathered to help , the second woman detonated her explosives , said musa , who was waiting outside the market in the male security line . the third attack occurred at a bus station . `` he came in our midst near the bus station and pressed a remote device he was holding in his hand , '' a wounded survivor who requested anonymity for his personal safety said from maiduguri general hospital . such attacks , sadly , are nothing new for borno state , one of those hit hardest by boko haram and the nigerian military 's campaign to stop them . the terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques , raided villages , and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last april from a school in chibok .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- an investigation is underway after a canine competitor died the day after taking part in crufts , one of the world 's most prestigious dog shows . an autopsy indicates he was poisoned . three-year-old irish setter thendara satisfaction -- known to his owners as jagger -- took second prize in his class at the event in birmingham , central england , on thursday . but just a day later , after returning home to belgium , he became ill . owner-breeder dee milligan-bott told cnn jagger was `` finding it hard to breathe '' so a veterinarian was called , but the dog died before he could get there . `` the vet thought it was suspicious , so carried out an autopsy , '' she said . `` they found cubes of beef in his stomach that had at least two types of poison inside . pieces of beef had been stitched together so that the poison did n't come out . `` he had enough in his system to kill a horse , according to the vet , '' said milligan-bott , who is at a loss to explain why jagger was targeted : `` we ca n't fathom why anyone would do this . '' `` i 've been doing this for 30-odd years and i think i would have to give up on everything if i believed that someone who shows and breeds dogs would kill a dog . we all do this because we love dogs . if you hate me for being successful , then stick a brick through my window or something . but why would you involve a dog ? '' toxicology tests are being carried out . the vet has reported the dog 's death to belgian police , and milligan-bott said she would likely contact west midlands police in the uk too . a spokesperson for the kennel club , organizers of the crufts dog show , said there had never been such an incident in the history of the competition , which dates back to 1891 . `` we are deeply shocked and saddened to hear this terrible news and our heartfelt sympathies go out to jagger 's owners , '' said caroline kisko , secretary of the kennel club , in a statement . `` we understand that a toxicology report is due next week and that this matter has been reported to the police - we will work with them and help however we can . '' television personality and writer clare balding , who hosts tv coverage of crufts in the uk , took to twitter to express her shock at the news : `` everyone at #crufts2015 horrified at death of irish setter jagger & post-mortem found poison . awful for all concerned , '' she tweeted .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a migrant worker whose life ended in washington after police shot at him 17 times . a father of four killed by an officer during a traffic stop in texas . a man killed during a robbery investigation in california . after three mexican citizens were killed by police in the united states in the past month , mexico 's foreign ministry says the u.s. justice department should step in . `` given that these incidents can not be looked at in isolation , the mexican government has called for the u.s. department of justice through its civil rights division to monitor the investigation of these three cases to assure that they 're conducted with transparency and where appropriate , the proper criminal or civil responsibility is determined , '' mexico 's foreign ministry said on monday . the mexican government 's statement comes amid a debate that has surged across the united states about whether police are using excessive force , particularly when they deal with minority groups . `` adding to our consternation over the third case of a mexican killed by an excessive use of force in less than one month , is our deep concern for the effect of the break in trust between the hispanic community and the police forces that could result from these actions , '' the foreign ministry said . investigators said they 're still piecing together information on all three cases . no charges have been filed . here 's a look at what we know so far : . protesters at a city council meeting in grapevine , texas , this week chanted a familiar refrain : `` hands up ! do n't shoot ! '' for the demonstrators , the chant -- which started as a call to action after the police shooting death of michael brown in ferguson , missouri -- has become a rallying cry for another case . police shot 31-year-old rubén garcía villalpando in the dallas suburb of euless , texas , on february 20 . investigators say the case started when a burglar alarm sounded at a business . villalpando 's car , which was in the area , was followed by police in what authorities described as a high-speed chase . eventually , villalpando pulled over . villalpando was unarmed , but in early reports about the shooting , police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer 's commands during a traffic stop . the traffic stop was caught on camera , but police have n't released the dash cam video to the public . `` there will be more information released as the investigation continues . this additional information may shed more light on mr. villalpando 's actions that night , '' police and city officials said . `` we look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident , which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident . '' villalpando 's family said they 've seen the video , and even though it does n't show the officer or the shooting , they said one thing is clear : villalpando was unarmed and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him . fernando romero said it was jarring to hear what his brother-in-law said in the video as he gets out of the vehicle . `` my brother-in-law is out of the car with his hands up , '' romero said , `` and the first thing he asks is , ` are you going to kill me ? ' '' marta romero , villalpando 's wife , said her husband made a mistake when he did n't stop when the officer tried to pull him over . but she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in . `` he was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer , and in the video you do n't see any of those things , '' she said . `` you see the opposite , a man who is scared , who is simply trying to calm the situation , who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands . '' police say ernesto javier canepa díaz , 28 , was killed february 27 after a shooting broke out during a robbery investigation . `` at this time we need the process to continue in order to know what happened , '' santa ana , california , police chief carlos rojas told cnn en español . he declined to comment on the investigation , but said canepa had been arrested in the past for various crimes , including narcotics possession , possessing stolen property , domestic violence and resisting police . when police came across his car last week , he was wanted for a series of robberies , rojas said . `` he did not cooperate with the police and we know that a police officer shot various times at him and he died at the scene , '' rojas said . and police , he said , found a replica of a gun inside the car . `` we do not know if this is the reason why the police officer used force . that will be investigated , '' rojas said . canepa 's family said they do n't believe police were justified in opening fire . `` whatever it was , he did not deserve to die this way , '' said mayte canepa , ernesto 's sister . `` he did not deserve for them to shoot at him like they did . '' the orange county register reported that at a press conference on tuesday , canepa 's brother , andres , described police as `` a gang with a badge . '' the officer who shot canepa has been suspended with pay until the investigation is finished , police said . a proud laborer from mexico , antonio zambrano-montes picked fruit in the orchards of washington state , but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year , he fell into deep despair . he could n't work or send money to family in mexico , two routines that shaped his life . it was this misfortune that distressed zambrano-montes in the days before he and police in pasco , washington , clashed in february , in a confrontation that ended with officers firing 17 bullets , hitting zambrano-montes several times and killing him . he was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks . police have said that zambrano-montes , 35 , was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by officers . he then allegedly stoned two officers , and police resorted to deadly force , authorities said . officers had used a taser on him , but it was n't effective , police said . the shooting now haunts his family , due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on youtube by bystanders . zambrano-montes ' family said his limited english left him unable to understand the officers ' commands , shouted in english . his mother , agapita montes , said she did n't see her son throwing rocks in the videos . `` the only thing i can see is that he 's running , he raises his hands and they still shoot him . why ? i ask myself . why ? '' montes said . erlinda zambrano , an aunt of zambrano-montes , also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events , she said . `` we are living with profound pain from how he died , and it 's something very bad and terrible , '' the aunt said . `` i look at the videos now and i can not sleep because it 's too hard .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- nineteen-year-old tony robinson was not armed when a madison , wisconsin , police officer fatally shot him , police chief mike koval said saturday . `` we have to be clear about this , '' koval said . `` he was unarmed . that 's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators , the public , to accept , to understand ... why deadly force had to be used . '' the officer who killed robinson , 12-year department veteran matt kenny , had used deadly force before , shooting and killing a man in 2007 , the chief said . kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation , the chief said , adding that the incident was `` concluded to be a suicide by cop '' situation . kenny was responding friday evening to a reported disturbance at a madison residence when robinson attacked him , koval said . robinson had a criminal history , according to the state of wisconsin public records . these records were first reported by the wisconsin state journal newspaper . wisconsin circuit court documents indicate that robinson pleaded guilty in december of last year to an armed robbery that occurred april 25 , 2014 . the madison police chief said that robinson was unarmed , but his officer was assaulted and an investigation is underway . koval , on saturday , refused to comment on robinson 's past police criminal history or past interactions . in a press conference , he stated , `` i could but i choose not to . i am not here to do a character workup on someone who lost his life less than 24 hours ago . '' `` i frankly think it is , for our purposes today , wholly inappropriate and i am not going to blemish anyone 's character particularly someone 's as young as his , '' koval said . but he also said that the public records were available to all . after the shooting , protesters in the university town took to the streets and converged on city hall , chanting `` black lives matter . '' koval called for calm , while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in ferguson , missouri , and staten island , new york , after confrontations with police . police described robinson as african-american . `` in light of so much things that have happened not just across the country , but in our own community , it 's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile , emotional and upsetting , '' the police chief told cnn affiliate wkow-tv . `` and we understand that . that 's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances . we would urge , obviously , that everyone exercise restraint . '' koval said he visited the home of robinson 's mother late friday and met robinson 's grandparents outside the house . they talked and prayed , the chief said , but they advised him to put off visiting robinson 's mother `` based on the dynamics '' of the situation . `` i could n't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences , '' he said . `` nineteen years old is too young . '' robinson 's mother , andrea irwin , told cnn affiliate wkow that she did n't understand what happened . `` my son has never been a violent person , never , '' she said . `` to die in such a violent way baffles me . '' irwin said robinson served as a father figure to her other children . `` he was our caretaker and so gentle , '' she said . the incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , koval said . dispatchers identified him as robinson , according to 911 audio obtained by wkow . a little later the dispatcher says , `` apparently tony hit one of his friends , um no weapons seen . '' about four minutes later , the dispatcher says , `` i got another call for the same suspect at -lsb- the same address -rsb- . he tried to strangle another patron . '' about 30 seconds later , an unidentified officer says , `` shots fired , shots fired . '' when kenny went to the apartment , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , koval said . `` once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , '' koval said . after that , according to the chief , `` the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject . '' backup officers and others at the scene performed cpr on the young man , who later died at the hospital . kenny suffered a blow to the head , but is being treated and will be released , koval said . kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay . koval said he 's not sure what robinson was doing at the house in the first place . `` his relationship to the home is unclear to me , although there were certainly familiar acquaintances . this was not a random place . he had hung out . '' in a statement saturday , state attorney general brad schimel said he `` can only imagine the heartbreak '' of robinson 's parents and added he 's `` concerned for the officer ... who , i imagine , is experiencing great trauma as well . '' `` they are all in my thoughts and prayers , '' schimel said . under wisconsin law , officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the division of criminal investigation . once dci completes the investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , koval said . some were demanding answers sooner rather than later . on friday night , dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment , which police had blocked off . a group also moved toward city hall before dispersing early saturday . `` who do we trust ? '' some called out , prompting the response , `` no one ! '' and in another refrain , they chanted , `` black lives matter . '' the protesters ' sentiments were echoed online , where some adopted the #willystreet hashtag in reference to williamson street , where the shooting happened . `` praying for madison tonight , '' wrote one activist . `` stand up , sit in , walk out - until u get answers . and until there are no more hashtag eulogies . '' mayor paul soglin spoke to the raw feelings , calling what happened `` an enormous tragedy . '' `` we 've got a family that 's really hurting , '' soglin said , according to wkow . `` and we 've got a city and neighborhood that 's feeling pretty well hurt itself . '' some of the protesters were members of the young , gifted and black coalition that was formed last summer after the michael brown shooting in ferguson . the group wants more reactive policing in african-american neighborhoods , said group member brandi grayson . she said madison police park on street corners in african-american neighborhoods and wait for something to happen , which leads to residents being hassled . that does n't happen in white neighborhoods , she said . she said young , gifted and black will be working with church groups on sunday and will hold more rallies tuesday and wednesday . cnn 's faith karami and kristina sgueglia contributed to this report .

'' less than an hour later , collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head . his car door was open , and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals . difava and other officers , assisted by surveillance videos , 911 callers and a lone bicyclist who happened to be passing by , recounted collier 's last moments in the death penalty trial of admitted boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev . the bicyclist , mit mathematics ph.d. candidate nathan harman , pointed to tsarnaev in court and identified him as the man with `` a big nose , '' who he saw leaning into collier 's squad car . he said tsarnaev appeared to be alone . tsarnaev , who was 19 at the time , does not dispute that he was present when collier was killed on the evening of april 18 , nor does he deny that he participated in the bombings three days earlier that killed three people and hurt more than 240 others . prosecutors say tsarnaev and his older brother , tamerlan tsarnaev , killed collier because they wanted his gun . but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster . the fbi had released photos of the pair five hours earlier , and they were on the run . but tamerlan , 26 , would not survive the night . he was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an `` officer down '' at mit . the mit police , who are designated as special officers by the massachusetts state police , patrol the sprawling campus in cambridge . collier 's beat was the area of north quad near main and vassar streets . he had been handling a routine call about a citizen who was upset his car had been towed . a young man called 911 about 10:20 p.m. and reported hearing loud noises outside his window . `` they do n't sound exactly like gunshots , '' the caller told dispatcher david sacco . he was n't sure what they were . maybe somebody banging on trash cans . sacco tried to summon collier on his police radio . no response . he sent an emergency alert . nothing . he tried texting him . still no response . `` it became an amount of time that was n't comfortable , '' he said . sgt. clarence henniger had returned to the station at the end of his shift , and had just passed collier on the way in . he saw nothing out of the ordinary . but when he heard dispatch could n't raise collier , he went back out to check on him . his car was in the same spot . `` i parked about 8-10 meters away from officer collier 's car , '' henniger said . `` when i arrived at the cruiser i looked inside and that 's when i observed a wound to the head , to the temple . i observed a wound to the neck and i observed a wound to his hand . '' prosecutor weinreb asked : `` was there blood ? '' `` yes sir , '' the witness responded . `` where ? '' `` all over the car and his body . '' jurors heard henniger 's frantic call over the police radio : . `` officer down ! officer down ! get me help ! officer down . '' he called for an ambulance , shouting , `` get on it !!! '' he and another officer pulled collier out of the squad car to attempt to revive him . `` the amount of blood on his body made it difficult to get a grip on him , '' henniger said . the other officer urged collier to `` hang in there , just hang in there , '' and asked `` who did this to you ? '' collier did not respond . cambridge police officer brendan o'hearn joined them , and took over applying chest compressions . `` his face and neck were covered with blood . there was some type of wound to his head , '' o'hearn said . collier was gurgling and blood was coming from his mouth . `` there was blood everywhere , '' o'hearn added . weinreb asked , `` did it transfer to you ? '' `` all over me . '' collier became the fourth victim of the tsarnaev brothers . campus surveillance cameras captured the encounter between collier and his killer . the footage was shot from a distance and at times , it is difficult to determine whether the cameras captured one person and a shadow or a pair walking closely together . the video shows collier 's patrol car idling near the front of the koch institute building , and a person or two people rounding the corner and walking towards it . the brake lights flash on , then off , and then off again . two people can be seen running back around the corner . off to the side , somebody on a bicycle rides by without stopping . harman , the grad student on the bicycle , often used the word `` they '' in his testimony at first , but said he saw just one person as he pedaled past . `` when i went by , the front door was open , the driver 's side door , '' he said . `` there was someone leaning into the driver 's side door . '' he said the person -- although he used the word `` they '' -- was bent at the waist and leaning into the patrol car . `` they stood up , startled , as i rode my bike by them , '' he added . later in his testimony , he began referring to `` they '' as `` he . '' `` i only saw one person , '' he said . `` he sort of snapped up , stood up , and turned around . he looked startled . we made eye contact . '' asked to describe who he saw , harman added , `` i remember thinking he had a big nose . '' he looked across the courtroom at tsarnaev , pointed , and said , `` he 's right there . '' the prosecution 's case has brought one dramatic day of testimony after another in the federal courthouse overlooking boston harbor . on tuesday , prosecutors displayed photos of what they called tsarnaev 's `` manifesto , '' scrawled in pencil on the sides of a dry-docked pleasure boat where he sought refuge april 19 . blood streaks and bullet holes punctuated his words , which he does not deny writing . the only issue in dispute is whether it is a confession or something else .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson police chief thomas jackson is about to be out of a job . jackson and city officials in the st. louis suburb have announced his resignation , effective march 19 . it 's the latest fallout after a justice department investigation slammed his department 's tactics . speculation has swirled for months that jackson would step down , and critics have pointed to several key points as signs that the police chief was in hot water . here 's a look at some key moments leading up to his resignation : . a police officer shoots and kills michael brown , an unarmed african-american teen . the incident exposes feelings of distrust between ferguson 's black community and its police department , which is overwhelmingly white . anger begins to simmer on that first day , when brown 's body is n't removed from the street for four hours . protests erupt . among demonstrators ' demands : that the police department release the name of the officer who shot brown . jackson reveals the name of the officer who shot brown , darren wilson . on that same day , the department releases surveillance video that he says shows brown robbing a store . jackson says he distributed the store videotape `` because the press asked for it , '' noting he could n't withhold it indefinitely . the chief adds , `` we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting , '' though he does n't elaborate on why . critics accuse him of inflaming tensions rather than getting the situation under control . in a youtube video , jackson apologizes to brown 's parents . `` i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son . i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove michael from the street , '' he said during his video statement . investigators were doing `` important work '' trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours , jackson said , but `` it was just too long , and i 'm truly sorry for that . '' `` overnight i went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation , '' he says in the video . `` as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation . i also want to be part of the solution . '' that night , he meets with protesters , agreeing to march with them . but even that meeting turns ugly ; a scuffle breaks out and arrests are made . jackson tells cnn 's erin burnett he plans to stay in his job as police chief . `` i intend to see this thing through . and i 've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems , '' he says . `` so , yes , i think i can -- i think i can see this through and come out on the other side with the community , the region and even the country a whole lot better . '' the justice department slams the ferguson police department for tactics that federal investigators say targeted african-americans . investigators also find evidence of racist jokes being sent around by ferguson police and court officials . asked about his reaction to the report by cnn 's sara sidner , jackson keeps mum , saying that he needs to analyze it further before he comments . asked what he 'll do in response , he says he will `` take action as necessary . '' the city says it has reached a deal for the police chief to resign , effective march 19 . jackson confirms his resignation in a letter , saying `` it is with profound sadness that i am announcing i am stepping down . '' in a text message response to cnn , jackson says , `` it 's a really hard pill to swallow . '' cnn 's sara sidner , eliott c. mclaughlin , dana ford and jason carroll contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the man suspected of killing a deputy u.s. marshal at a motel in baton rouge , louisiana , has died , brittany stewart in the east baton rouge coroner 's office said wednesday . the cause of death is pending autopsy , she said . jamie croom , 31 , was wounded in a shootout with deputy u.s. marshal josie wells . it can be one of the most dangerous tasks for a law enforcement officer : serving an arrest warrant to a fugitive murder suspect . when wells tried to do that tuesday , he lost his life . `` wells was part of a team executing arrest warrants on a fugitive wanted for double homicide in baton rouge , '' the u.s. marshals service said in a news release . `` the team engaged in gunfire with the fugitive and wells was shot . he was immediately transported to lane regional medical center in zachary , louisiana , where he died . '' wells , 28 , was trying to arrest croom , who is suspected in the deaths of a brother and sister in new roads , louisiana , cnn affiliate wafb said . `` our deputies and law enforcement partners face untold dangers every day in the pursuit of justice in cities nationwide , '' said u.s. marshals service director stacia a. hylton said in a news release . `` the fugitive who killed deputy wells was extremely dangerous , wanted for double homicide and intentionally evaded justice . ... when a public servant dies in the line of duty , it is an immeasurable tragedy felt by all . our thoughts and prayers are with deputy wells ' family , friends and colleagues . '' officials would not elaborate on exactly what happened , but the advocate newspaper in baton rouge said there was a shootout . authorities said croom shot and killed wells at a baton rouge motel . wells , 28 , was based in mississippi but was on temporary assignment in the baton rouge area , the sun herald newspaper said . he was married and came from a law enforcement family . despite the risks , wells loved his job . `` it was his passion , '' longtime friend alex mcgee told the paper . `` i tipped my hat to him because he knew the dangers and wanted to do the job anyway . '' croom , the suspect , was taken to a hospital after he was wounded , wafb said . he was wanted in the shooting deaths of the two siblings in february and was also on probation for firearms charges . that double homicide stemmed from a feud over a loan made to one of the victim 's relatives as well as an alleged break-in at the suspect 's grandmother 's house , croom 's older sister latonia croom duncan told cnn . duncan said the family reported threats and a shooting at her grandmother 's house to police , but said there was never any follow-up . she said her brother called her the night of the homicides , which took place at a nightclub . `` he called me and said he loved me and that he 'd be gone , '' duncan said . `` he said he was n't going back to jail . before he 'd go back to jail , he said , he 'd rather be dead .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- two police officers shot and wounded while standing guard outside the ferguson , missouri , police department early thursday were deliberately targeted in what a police official called an `` ambush . '' such ambush-style attacks were the leading circumstance in the surging number of shooting deaths of law enforcement officers , according to the nonprofit , washington-based national law enforcement officers memorial fund . the shootings were a chilling low point in the protests in the st. louis suburb since a ferguson police officer shot and killed 18-year-old michael brown in august . the demonstrators were out again late wednesday -- in response to the announcement hours earlier of ferguson police chief thomas jackson 's resignation -- when shots rang out from a hill about 125 yards from where the protesters had gathered , according to witnesses . st. louis county police chief jon belmar said the shootings were an `` ambush '' intended `` for whatever nefarious reason '' to inflict harm on the officers . the officers -- one shot in the face , the other in the shoulder -- have been released from the hospital . u.s. attorney general eric holder decried the shootings as a `` heinous assault -lrb- that -rrb- was inexcusable and repugnant . '' calling the shooting a `` cowardly action , '' holder said , `` i condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms , and the department of justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities . '' the number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50 % in 2014 , the law enforcement group said in a report released in december . many of those shootings occurred during police interactions with suspects such as traffic stops , responses to disturbances or attempted arrests . such was the case in baton rouge , louisiana , on tuesday , when deputy u.s. marshal josie wells was killed in an exchange of gunfire after going to arrest a fugitive murder suspect at a motel . however , ambushes were the largest single category of circumstances in the shooting deaths of officers in 2014 , according to the group 's report . fifty officers were killed by firearms -- 15 in ambush attacks -- in 2014 , the memorial fund said . that 's compared with five ambushes among 32 shooting deaths in 2013 and six ambush deaths during 2012 , according to the fbi . but those ambush numbers have trended higher before in previous years : the fbi counted 15 officer deaths by ambush each year in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 . ambush situations were the biggest category of circumstance behind 543 officers feloniously killed from 2002 to 2011 : 23.2 % . ambush killings are nothing new . the fbi defines two types : . one is by `` entrapment and premeditation , '' which is a scenario `` where the officer was lured into danger as the result of conscious consideration and planning . these attacks are generally accomplished from cover or hiding ; however , they can occur without cover or hiding , '' the agency said . the second are ambushes of `` unprovoked attacks , '' which are `` generally accomplished without hiding ; however , they can occur with or without cover , '' the fbi said . harry houck , a consultant and former new york police department detective , said officers could be second-guessing themselves as scrutiny of the police increases . `` if an officer is afraid to immediately react the way he 's supposed to , '' he said , `` that could cost him his life . '' according to the national law enforcement officers memorial fund 2014 report , 126 federal , state , local , tribal and territorial officers died in the line of duty in 2014 , compared with 102 and 123 the previous two years . most of the on-duty deaths considered `` non-felonious '' were from traffic accidents or health reasons . cnn has not analyzed each case and can not authenticate the group 's findings . after the findings were released in december , holder said : `` these troubling statistics underscore the very real dangers that america 's brave law enforcement officers face every time they put on their uniforms . each loss is both tragic and unacceptable -- a beloved father , mother , son or daughter who never came home to their loved ones . '' he said that the department of justice is doing its own analysis of officer deaths in 2014 `` so we can mitigate risks in the future . '' the report 's release came amid simmering distrust and tension between police and some communities across the country . it was published less than two weeks after the december 20 ambush killing of two new york city police officers . ismaaiyl brinsley , 28 , approached officers wenjian liu and rafael ramos as they sat in their marked patrol car in brooklyn on december 20 and shot them to death . he killed himself shortly afterward . the police memorial fund invoked the memories of liu and ramos ' deaths in a december statement . `` with the increasing number of ambush-style attacks against our officers , i am deeply concerned that a growing anti-government sentiment in america is influencing weak-minded individuals to launch violent assaults against the men and women working to enforce our laws and keep our nation safe , '' said craig w. floyd , chairman and ceo of the police fund . `` enough is enough , '' he said . `` we need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness . '' that angry rhetoric is n't confined to the case of ferguson -- or of staten island , new york , where the death of eric garner in july after police attempted to subdue him spurred national protests and preceded the slayings of liu and ramos , said steve groeninger , a spokesman for the memorial fund . groeninger said the uptick in ambush-style attacks was `` punctuated '' by the new york officers ' slayings , but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the fund . they included : . • in las vegas in june , jerad miller and his wife surprised two police officers as they ate lunch , shooting them to death . witnesses said the millers placed a `` do n't tread on me '' flag and a swastika on one officer 's body . the couple then died in a murder-suicide as police closed in . • in jersey city , new jersey , in july , police said a man assaulted a walgreen 's security guard and took his gun in order to carry out the ambush-style killing of an officer , according to the jersey journal . • two pennsylvania state police troopers were ambushed and shot outside police barracks in blooming grove in september . the hunt for the alleged killer , eric frein , lasted almost seven weeks . he was captured at an abandoned airport on october 30 . frein was hit with terrorism charges in november for allegedly admitting that he shot the officers to change the government and `` wake people up . '' but the number of shootings by police officers also is on the rise . according to data collected by the fbi , there were 461 justifiable homicides in 2013 -- the highest level since 1994 and the most recent year available . the figures are incomplete , however , because the shootings are self-reported and not all police departments provide them . the total number of fatal shootings by police officers is much higher -- 1,010 in 2013 and 1,134 last year , according to the nonprofit fatal encounters . the group started collecting the data in 2013 . its source of information is different from the fbi 's . the group 's founder , brian burghart , said the figures create a toxic environment for police , as well as suspects . `` when it comes to an eye for an eye , that people are addressing the problems with violence , the numbers are always going to go up on both sides , '' he said . this week , wisconsin residents took to the streets to protest the police killing of tony robinson , a 19-year-old who was unarmed . robinson 's shooting was the fourth involving an officer in wisconsin in the last three weeks . the others hardly made headlines : one involved an armed robbery , another a domestic abuser who put a knife to his girlfriend 's throat , and another involved an assailant with a fake gun . last april , milwaukee police officer christopher manney shot dontre hamilton , a mentally ill man , more than a dozen times . the officer said he opened fire when hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it . manney was not charged criminally . instead , he was fired for not following protocol . milwaukee county sheriff david clarke accused politicians of fueling what he called an `` assault '' on policing . `` war has been declared on the american police officer , '' clarke told cnn on friday . `` and i 'm tired of politicians taking all of the maladies of the american ghetto and blaming them on the american police officer . ... they jumped in , early on , instead of offering calm words , they threw gas on an already smoldering fire . '' experts say the numbers alone do n't tell the whole story . `` we need to know the circumstances in each individual case , '' said houck , the consultant and former new york police department detective . cnn 's michael martinez contributed to this report .

los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- the search for a rookie los angeles police department officer suspected of homicide has expanded into an international manhunt , focused on the border cities of el paso , texas , and ciudad juarez , mexico . the fbi said friday it believes awol policeman henry solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from southern california to el paso with his father in a pickup a week ago . the fbi is offering $ 25,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of solis in connection with the death of salome rodriguez , 23 , who died after a fight between the men in a downtown pomona , california , bar . `` the pattern suggests he crossed into mexico , but he has family and friends living in el paso and ciudad juarez , '' said scott garriola , special fbi agent who runs the fugitive task force from the los angeles bureau . `` so he could be on either side of the border .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the emissions sticker on david kassick 's car was expired . that 's what first caught the attention of lisa mearkle , a police officer in hummelstown borough , pennsylvania , who ordered kassick , 59 , to pull over on february 2 . instead , kassick fled . moments later , he lay dead on the ground in a yard near a relative 's home . on tuesday , mearkle was arrested on a homicide charge following a state police investigation into the shooting . mearkle 's attorney , who described the use of deadly force in the case as justified , said he is girding his client for national scrutiny as the case finds itself on a growing list of officer-involved shootings . the final moments leading to kassick 's death were captured on video which dauphin county district attorney ed marsico jr. said was critical in bringing the homicide charges . it was around 4 p.m. on february 2 when the 15-year police veteran first attempted to pull kassick over , according to the charging documents . instead of pulling over , kassick took off and mearkle gave chase , flipping on her lights and sirens . less than a mile away , kassick pulled into the driveway of a relative he 'd been staying with and ran off on foot into the backyard , with mearkle following close behind . as they ran through the yards behind grandview drive , the charging documents said , mearkle fired her stun gun , automatically engaging a built-in audio and visual recording device . marsico described the video : . `` she 's running , she 's tasing him , he falls to the ground . he 's sort of writhing around on the ground a little bit , '' marsico said . standing several feet behind his prone body , mearkle shouts for kassick to show his hands . despite the commands , marsico said there were multiple points in the videos where kassick is seen reaching beneath himself , his hands obscured to mearkle . holding the taser in her left hand , court documents said , mearkle drew her gun in her right hand and , while continuing to shout `` show me your hands , '' fired twice into kassick 's back . kassick was pronounced dead at the scene . he was unarmed . marsico said the video was critical in determining the first criminal charges brought against a police officer in a shooting like this in his 15 years as district attorney . `` he was face down on the ground , no weapon had been displayed . he did n't approach her , he did n't come toward her , he did n't verbally threaten her in any way , '' marsico said of kassick . `` it 's our position that her use of deadly force was not necessary . '' cnn has filed a freedom of information act request to obtain the video , which it has not independently viewed . mearkle later told investigators she thought kassick had been reaching into his jacket for a gun , according to court documents . `` what was she supposed to do ? '' mearkle 's attorney , brian perry said . `` she felt that this was the only option that she had . '' `` keep in mind she had tased this individual four times and was screaming commands to him and he kept reaching under , '' perry said . mearkle was placed on electronic monitoring on tuesday after posting $ 250,000 bail . `` this was an extremely difficult case for all involved but in the end , we are servants of justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented , '' the borough of hummelstown said in a statement . hummelstown borough announced on wednesday that mearkle had been suspended from the police department without pay .

'' `` it 's a tough thing to relay to your fellow officers who have to go out there to continue to do this job , '' morales said . `` but rest assured , that we will keep him in our memories as we go out there and continue to do the job that we love to do , and i 'm sure he loved to do . '' in wisconsin , casper was killed after chasing a bank robbery suspect in fond du lac , authorities said . he had been sworn in as a state trooper in december , according to media reports and a facebook page dedicated to his memory . `` trevor casper was a lively young man , '' burrell recalled . `` he was very excited about his opportunity to be a trooper ... he always had a smile on his face . when we met several times , i always asked if he was having fun and his response was , ' i sure am , ' with a smile on his face . '' gunfire rang out when the trooper was pursuing a car that matched the description of one used in a bank robbery , cnn affiliate witi-tv in milwaukee reported . the suspect , identified as steven timothy snyder , also died , according to the wisconsin department of justice . no other details of the pursuit were available . police believe the suspect may have shot and killed a man in his 60s after leaving the bank , the station reported . authorities are not looking for any additional suspects . lt. col. brian rahn of the wisconsin state patrol said the rookie officer 's handling of the fatal encounter was `` absolute textbook -- from the time he made contact with the vehicle until the event was over . '' the wisconsin department of justice 's division of criminal investigation will conduct an investigation , a requirement for officer-involved shootings in the state . `` our son trevor was an amazing young man who from a young age would do anything to help anyone , '' the trooper 's family said in a statement posted on facebook . `` it did not surprise us when he selected a career in law enforcement . even as a young child he was always helping others . trevor had a soft and good heart . he truly believed his sole purpose in life was to serve and protect others . '' when his family asked casper whether he was ready for a career as a trooper , `` trevor proudly told us that he was ` born ready to do this job . ' trevor was so very proud of his career as a wisconsin state trooper . as a family we are so deeply honored that our son served as a law enforcement officer with the wisconsin state patrol and we share in their grief and loss . we are so deeply saddened by this loss and wish to thank everyone who has assisted us during this time , '' the statement added . the shooting occurred on the four-year anniversary of the death of fond du lac police officer craig birkholz , who was shot and killed during a standoff with a suspect , witi reported . `` our hearts go out to his fellow officers , his friends , and especially his family , '' said a statement on the wisconsin professional police association 's facebook page . `` may we never forget his sacrifice and that of his loved ones who shared and supported his devotion to our common security .

beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- native to a remote region of china , this tiny mammal , known as the ili pika , does n't know it 's a member of an endangered species -- and neither do most people . rarer -- and some would argue cuter -- than the panda , there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear-like creatures living in the tianshan mountain range in the xinjiang region of northwestern china , says conservationist li weidong . li discovered the pika , formally known as ochotona iliensis , in 1983 and named it after his hometown , ili . last july , li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s . he estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70 % since its discovery . `` i discovered the species , and i watched as it became endangered , '' he told cnn . `` if it becomes extinct in front of me , i 'll feel so guilty . '' in 2008 , the animal was listed as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature but there 's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it , according to li . the mammal , only 20 centimeters long , lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations . li says the pika 's habitat has been affected by global warming . due to rising temperatures , glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the tianshan mountains , forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops , li said . ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters , he said . now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters . `` they have nowhere else to retreat , '' he added . it 's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species , so if predators are near , ili pikas are not able to alert each other , li said . disease may also be a factor in its decline . in 1983 , when li first came across the mammal , nobody knew what it was . two years later , li found another two and it was declared a new species . in the decade following , li and his colleagues conducted a number of studies , including a census at 14 different sites . however , in 1992 , li left ili to work with xinjiang academy of environmental protection in the regional capital urumqi . no studies were conducted on ili pika in the following decade . no one saw the pika , either . in 2002 and 2003 , li , with a team of volunteers , conducted a fresh census . despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips , they came up empty handed . however , by analyzing droppings and snow tracks , li , along with arizona state university biologist andrew smith , was able to conclude that the ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline . together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals , down from 2,900 in the early 1990s . the research , published in 2005 , recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered . in 2007 , li retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika . last year , he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras . this time , on the second day of the field trip , they finally spotted a pika , who jumped and stepped over li 's feet while he was trying to photograph it . the volunteers dubbed it a `` magic rabbit . '' they concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 ili pikas , said li . `` this tiny species could be extinct any time , '' he said . `` they do n't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore . '' li funds the research with himself , along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the world wide fund for nature . he says he has spent more than $ 32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas . but what upsets li most is n't the lack of funding . it 's the lack of official recognition for the ili , and other pikas ' plight . the ili pika is n't included on china 's list of wildlife under special state protection -- part of the country 's 1988 wildlife protection law . the department for wildlife and forest plants protection , under the ministry of forestry , said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details . li and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal . `` i 'm almost 60 , and soon i wo n't be able to climb the tianshan mountains , '' he said . `` so i really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the ili pika .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- lindsey vonn lifted her crystal globe prize with pride after winning the world cup downhill title for a seventh time , wednesday . a crystal ball might be more useful for the american star , who has faced plenty of slippery slopes in her dramatic skiing career . the 30-year-old has twice fought back from a career-threatening right knee injury but this season she has been back to her brilliant best . at the final meeting of the ski season in the pretty french resort of meribel , vonn raced to more records on the women 's world cup tour -- a seventh downhill season title and her 18th crystal globe overall . the sparkly spheres are handed out to winners of the world cup individual disciplines . `` this downhill title probably means more to me than the others because i 've been through so much , '' vonn told cnn 's alpine edge . `` it means everything to me , this is what i 've been working so hard for for the last two years . `` this season definitely got off to a better start than i expected and i 've had some ups and downs for sure but to come away with a globe after a long season is something that i 'm really proud of , so it could n't be better for me right now , i 'm so thrilled . '' vonn , who credits boyfriend tiger woods with inspiring her recovery , fended off the challenge of austria 's anna fenninger to claim the downhill crown by 103 points . despite the softening snow , the american won the downhill race with a fastest time of one minute , 29.87 seconds while fenninger finished off the pace in eighth . as she crossed the line , she punched the air and screamed at the crowd when she saw she was in first position . after receiving her crystal globe , she celebrated with her team by popping champagne and spraying it over her nearby supporters . vonn and fenninger will renew their rivalry thursday for the super-g title , where vonn holds an eight-point lead over her challenger . if vonn wins tomorrow she will equal swede ingemar stenmark , who owns an overall record of 19 crystal globes . `` i 'm not thinking about that , '' vonn insisted with a laugh . `` it 's always hard to get titles - it 's a long season , and it takes a lot to win the crystal globe but tomorrow i 'm just going to be focusing on skiing my best , just as i did today .

lynchburg , virginia -lrb- cnn -rrb- sen. ted cruz , the conservative firebrand from texas , became the first republican to announce his campaign for the presidency , and he spent monday morning telling a crowd at the largest christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office , and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign . `` these are all of our stories , '' cruz told the audience monday , roaming around the circular stage at liberty university , in lynchburg , virginia , opening his remarks by spotlighting his family history and his own path to washington . `` these are who we are as americans . and yet for so many americans , the promise of america seems more and more distant . '' cruz drew on the past only to focus on the future , repeatedly and emphatically asking the liberty university student audience to `` imagine '' the u.s. under conservative leadership -- laying out his vision for the country and a cruz presidency . the senator from texas , who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to obamacare and his willingness to shut down the federal government , presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment republicans such as florida gov. jeb bush -- candidates cruz coyly refers to as the `` mushy middle . '' monday 's event was the last part of a carefully coordinated media rollout , following cruz 's announcement of his candidacy in a 30-second video message posted on twitter shortly after midnight on monday , roughly 24 hours after the houston chronicle first reported his planned announcement . ten thousand students from liberty university crowded into the university 's main arena for cruz 's announcement . the venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give cruz an early boost among evangelical voters , who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like iowa and south carolina that have early nominating contests . it was a youthful crowd , as students are required to attend the university 's tri-weekly convocation address . not all in the audience were guaranteed cruz supporters : several attendees sported red `` stand with rand '' shirts , repping kentucky republican sen. rand paul , who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month . jerry falwell jr. , the university 's president and son of its founder and evangelical icon , introduced cruz as a senator who `` has gone against the tide '' and a `` man of great character , '' all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office . falwell picked up on cruz 's assertion that millions of evangelical christians did not vote in 2012 , pointing out that `` if any candidate can energize that group , it will make a huge difference in any national race . '' asked after the speech how he prepared for the event , cruz said he `` spent some time in prayer '' thinking about the message he wants to convey . `` at the end of the day it 's listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around , '' cruz told cnn , adding that he was `` incredibly '' encouraged and inspired by the support . cruz 's announcement came on the five-year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care act , also known as obamacare , which cruz has fought in the senate to repeal . cruz marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal `` every word '' of the healthcare law as president . cruz also jabbed at common core education standards -- which bush supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the irs , instead suggesting americans could file their taxes on a postcard . and cruz drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to `` imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of israel . '' cruz 's advisers envision a three-pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the tea party faction and competing in the libertarian and christian conservative circles . a constant and vocal critic of the obama administration , cruz is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against obamacare in 2013 , which led to a tense standoff between democrats and republicans and ultimately resulted in a 17-day government shutdown . the showdown was punctuated by cruz 's 21-hour speech on the senate floor . while popular in conservative and tea party circles , cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the gop base , according to public opinion polls . a cnn/orc international survey conducted this month on the hypothetical republican primary showed cruz came in with 4 % support among republicans and independents who lean republican . but the field is still relatively open , with the top contender -- bush -- coming in at 16 % support , followed by scott walker at 13 % . but cruz has relatively strong favorability numbers . according to a recent quinnipiac university poll , he is viewed in a positive light by 45 % of republicans , compared with only 8 % who do n't have a favorable opinion of him . still , 46 % say they have n't heard enough about him to form an opinion . jason miller , an adviser to cruz 's campaign , confirmed that the campaign 's fund-raising target is $ 40 million , and the campaign believes it can raise $ 1 million in the first week . cruz this month finished an early-voting state tour to iowa , south carolina and new hampshire -- and he 's scheduled to return to new hampshire on march 28 to speak at a brunch in rockingham county . depending on the senate schedule this week , he could possibly make more early-state trips , according to advisers . after his speech monday , he 'll head up to new york for media appearances and a fund-raiser . cruz developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in texas as a little-known candidate , forcing then-lt . gov. david dewhurst into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment republican . along with two other first-term senators who are expected to run for president -lrb- rand paul and marco rubio -rrb- , cruz will likely face questions over experience , an issue that republicans brought up in 2008 against barack obama , who was also a first-term senator at the time . before running for the senate in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- cruz was solicitor general of texas and argued before the supreme court . he graduated from princeton university and harvard law school . born in canada to a cuban father and american mother , cruz was a dual citizen until he renounced canadian citizenship in 2014 . he faced questions over whether he would qualify for the presidency , though law experts consider him a natural-born citizen because he was born to an american mother . cruz was swarmed by students and reporters after he descended the stage and started to exit the arena . he took photos and signed autographs for about a half hour , as his team tried to escort him through the crowd . one girl who was raising money selling baked goods offered to give cruz a dozen cupcakes for free but he pulled out his wallet and gave her $ 20 . a pair of enthusiastic sisters shouted out to cruz to tell him that , like his own daughters , they were also named caroline and catherine and were two years apart . `` that 's just cool , '' he said , as he gave them both high fives . `` that is awesome . '' one student who said she was hispanic said she and her whole family were behind him . `` you have the hispanic vote , '' she joked , then proceeded to start talking to him spanish . while cruz 's father is cuban , he 's not fluent in spanish . `` we grew up speaking spanglish . my grandmother would be like ` nino , throw me the remote control ' , '' he said this is who we are as a people . we got to tell that story , '' cruz said . cnn 's adam levy and kevin bohn contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the birthplace of coca-cola , `` gone with the wind '' and martin luther king jr. is still home to the busiest passenger airport in the world . more than 96 million passengers went through hartsfield-jackson atlanta international airport in 2014 , an increase of 1.9 % over 2013 , according to airports council international 's preliminary passenger traffic data , released thursday . with more than 86 million passengers last year , beijing capital international airport remained in second place and continued to close the gap just a bit more with atlanta , according to the worldwide association of airports . it saw an increase of 2.9 % over 2013 . atl24 : 24 hours in the world 's busiest airport . london 's heathrow airport continued to hold on to third place for another year , with more than 73 million passengers , an increase of 1.4 % . toyko 's haneda airport was fourth with nearly 73 million passengers , a 5.7 % increase over 2013 . the airports in fifth , sixth and seventh places swapped spots . los angeles international airport moved up from sixth to fifth , dubai moved up from seventh to sixth , and chicago o'hare international airport dropped from fifth to seventh . there were no changes to paris charles de gaulle -lrb- eighth place -rrb- , dallas/fort worth -lrb- ninth -rrb- and hong kong -lrb- 10th -rrb- . passenger traffic continued to grow around the globe , with the world 's airports serving more than 6.6 billion passengers in 2014 , an increase of 5.1 % over the previous year , according to the report . though the news was mostly good for atlanta , the city did lose some bragging rights . chicago/atlanta airport rivalry heats up . chicago o'hare took the top spot from atlanta in the number of takeoffs and landings , officially known as aircraft movements . a spokesman for the atlanta airport says its carriers are adding more aircraft with higher passenger capacity , which means fewer planes . o'hare took first place with 881,000 movements , followed by atlanta with 868,359 and los angeles with 708,674 . rounding out that list were dallas/fort worth , beijing , denver , charlotte , las vegas , houston and london . airport movements in both chicago and atlanta actually decreased compared with 2013 . chicago 's movements dropped by 0.2 % , and atlanta 's dropped by 4.7 % . hong kong 's airport is still the busiest cargo airport in the world , transporting more than 4.4 million metric tons of cargo in 2014 . memphis , tennessee , home to fedex , came in second place with 4.2 million metric tons and shanghai was third with nearly 3.2 million metric tons . -lrb- one metric ton equals 2,205 pounds . -rrb- . rounding out the top 10 were cargo airports in incheon , south korea ; anchorage , alaska ; dubai ; louisville , kentucky ; tokyo -lrb- narita -rrb- ; frankfurt , germany ; and taipei , taiwan . the airports council international preliminary traffic report was based on data from 1,095 airports worldwide . a final version will be released later in the year .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 've dressed up in the same type of costume on halloween for years -- always a superhero . not one character in particular . `` just any excuse to put on a wig and a cape , '' i 'd tell friends . last year , i found a more specific persona . i would be wonder woman . see , this halloween was different : i 'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor just weeks before , and donning this costume was a lighthearted way to feel empowered ahead of the biggest fight of my life . it was saturday , october 25 , 2014 -- earlier than usual for me to think about a costume for my favorite holiday . but this year , i would n't be able to party on the same day as everyone else . i was organizing one last massive celebration to honor my life and the people i love before my brain surgery two days later . it all started early one morning in september while i was wrapping up my work as a digital producer for cnn 's `` new day . '' as i was typing at the computer , letters were dropping off the right side of the screen . i started to feel strange and went to the nurse 's office in my building to ask for help . my speech began to slur , my hands were tingling , and my head was pounding . i also forgot my co-workers ' and bosses ' names . the nurse thought i could be having a stroke and called an ambulance . within an hour , i went from thinking i might have a migraine because i needed new glasses to being rushed to the hospital . i was 28 years old . they stripped off my clothes in the emergency room to hook me up to the machines that would reveal i was n't having a stroke . great news ! but then , what was going on ? first person : shopping for a new coat unleashes old memories . after an mri , we had the beginning of an answer . when i looked at the scan of my brain , sitting there , big as an orange , in the left hemisphere was a large black spot . my speech came back fully after a few hours , but a terrible headache lingered all day , and i was kept in the hospital overnight without discussing with the medical staff the full details of what was found on the scan . my family and i were scheduled to meet with a brain surgeon the next morning . about 6 a.m. , i was asleep when a resident came into my room and woke me up . he wanted to talk about my case , he said . `` my parents are coming later , and we 're meeting with the doctor , '' i told this stranger . `` ms. moskowitz , we suspect you have a meningioma . '' he could have been speaking russian . `` we see you have a brain tumor , and you 'll have to have surgery to have it removed , '' he said in a calm , even tone . i do n't remember what i asked him after that , but once he left , i felt hopeless and alone . tears poured out of my eyes , and i sucked in air when i ran out of breath . it was the most afraid i 've ever been in my life . when my parents arrived , we met with the surgeon , who offered more clarity . he suspected that the tumor was slowly growing deep in the left ventricle of my brain for years . and the incident at work ? perhaps a miniseizure related to the tumor , but they could n't be sure . i was told the mass was n't life-threatening at that point and probably was not cancer , but the location was very deep and unique . the tumor was growing in an open tunnel in my brain and would eventually grow big enough to block the flow of spinal fluid . surgery was recommended sooner rather than later . first person : caught in grief 's riptide . after my terrible experience earlier in the day with the resident who loved to share bad news and disappear , i knew i did n't want to have my surgery at this hospital . it was time to shop around for a brain surgeon . two weeks after the incident at work , i saw a doctor at nyu who talked about the surgery in dire terms . there was a 10 % chance i would need a shunt to help drain excess fluid from my brain for the rest of my life . unsatisfied with that option , i kept browsing . wonderful colleagues and friends within the cnn medical unit helped me find dr. jeffrey bruce at new york-presbyterian hospital . dr. bruce is a tall , commanding man with the confidence and swagger you 'd hope for in a brain surgeon . somehow , his description of the seven-hour procedure and what would come later did n't seem as scary as before . we booked the date for the surgery at the end of october . `` this is just like a pebble in my brain , '' i told friends . `` they 'll get it out , and i can move on with my life . '' two days before the operation , my friends and family gathered at a bar in brooklyn for that pre-halloween , prebirthday , presurgery party . i wore a short blue wig with my wonder woman outfit and set up a photo area to document everyone 's costumes . we all laughed and danced for hours , and at the end of the party , whoever was left did the hora . we ran in and out of a circle , joyfully raising our hands in the air . ghosts and pumpkins mingled with birthday decor . although i was born at the end of november , i wanted to cover all my holidays since i had no idea what the future would hold . first person : the only cuba i 've ever known . what if they took the tumor out and it was cancer after all ? what if they could n't get the whole thing during the operation and had to do radiation later ? what about that shunt ? what if anything went wrong and i would never be myself again ? at the hospital , my family bickered about who got a chair in the waiting room as i sat silently , waiting to be whisked through the double doors and into the rest of my life . once i was on the operating table with the iv in , the anesthesiologist started the magic medicine , and i barely started to count before i was knocked out . i woke up one brain tumor lighter and surrounded by the people i love . i spent five days in the hospital , mostly sleeping from the antiseizure medicine . real halloween came and passed . friends and co-workers came to the hospital to tell me stories about their holiday adventures and share pictures of their nights . if i was ever lonely or uncertain about my place in the world before , having this experience was a relatively quick way to discover that i have tremendous love and support in my life . my recovery has taken a lot of hard work . i went straight from the hospital to inpatient rehab to weekly outpatient care , working on speech , occupational therapy and memory recall . i did so well there , i was named february 's `` patient of the month . '' when my doctor recently told me i 've had the best recovery she 's ever seen over her 20-year career , i burst into tears of joy . the experience has given me confidence in my resilience and more perspective than before on the importance of living in the present , because things could always be worse -- completely out of nowhere and totally unexpectedly . that fact was solidified when just a month after my surgery , my best friend 's sister died from a brain aneurysm . survivor 's guilt overwhelmed me , but so did a sense of gratitude . i do n't have an answer as to why i 'm ok and my friend is gone , but i know it makes me push harder as i sweat through spin class and linger longer while i stare at sunsets and beautiful views . my zest for life itself -- the good and bad -- is so much stronger than before . i returned to work part-time , working one day a week starting in february . i 'm at two days a week now and hope to be back producing digital content full-time for `` new day '' by may . though i 'm now at the edge of 30 with a new identity as a survivor , i do n't consider myself a superhero . at least not until next halloween .
maui , hawaii -lrb- cnn -rrb- when she was just 4 years old , chelsea elliott went blind in her left eye . then , two years later , she lost hearing in her right ear . now 24 , elliott might have been spared years of struggle if her rare eye condition -- known as coats disease -- had been caught earlier . not wanting other children to feel the same frustration , anger and limitations , elliott launched a nonprofit that offers free vision and hearing screenings to school-age children -- particularly from lower income communities . here 's a stunning statistic : 25 % of u.s. children ages 5-17 suffer from vision problems , according to the national commission on vision and health . nonetheless , eight states still fail to require vision screenings at schools . undetected and untreated , eye disorders can result in delayed reading and poorer academic outcomes . elliott 's organization , the half-helen foundation , has screened nearly 9,000 children in texas and hawaii since its 2013 launch . as you might guess , the name honors helen keller -- who overcame blindness and hearing loss as an infant . before her death in 1968 , keller learned to speak and then eventually earned degrees from radcliffe college and harvard university , inspiring countless people around the world . `` when i learned about helen keller for the first time in the fourth grade , i surmised that i am half blind and half deaf like half helen , '' said elliott . `` what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf ? '' do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 . i talked with elliott about the motivation behind her work . below is an edited version of our conversation . cnn : you do vision screenings right in the schools . how does it work ? chelsea elliott : we use our tool , the spot camera . this device allows us to test for the six most common vision impairments in children in seconds . we are looking to see if they 're near-sighted , if they 're far-sighted , if they have astigmatism , or if they 're at risk for conditions like lazy eye or strabismus or if there 's a difference in pupil size . the spot camera is a hand-held autorefractor that takes a picture of a child 's eyes . it has multi-colored infrared light -- a red , blue and green light that flashes . children tell me it looks like a video game . often i 'm trying to get the child to look straight into the camera . so once i capture their attention , the camera will capture the image and the screening is done . it 's that quick . we learn so much more about a child 's vision health in a fraction of the time it takes to do a basic eye chart test . after the screening , we deliver referral reports to the school health aide to distribute to the families . the families communicate directly with us if they need assistance in seeking corrective wear or access to an eye care professional . if a child passes , all the better . but if a child fails , then we 've found one who we can help , and that 's one less child who has to know the struggle or the headaches or the frustration from not being able to see . see more cnn heroes . cnn : your efforts first started in texas . why did you choose to focus on hawaii next ? elliott : the state of hawaii currently does not require vision or hearing screenings in schools . so it has been left to the hands of service or civic organizations . only certain schools on the island were receiving vision screenings , when it was convenient . it was n't being done -lrb- systematically -rrb- . so i reached out to some civic groups here that had been conducting screenings and asked if i could come out and present how we do our work . and they , in turn , invited me to come out for a year and pilot our maui 528 program . it 's the perfect pilot group size . with 21,000 students and the technology available , we calculated it would actually take us about 528 hours to screen all 21,000 students . cnn : how can a vision problem affect a child 's education ? elliott : a child 's learning can be set back several years by not being able to see the words on the page or if they 're at a slant , if they 're blurred , if they 're nonexistent . they lose that self-confidence in their learning , that drive to push them forward , all because they were never screened for a potential condition that is easily correctable . it 's so commonly assumed that you can see a problem . i was 4 years old , and i had no visual symptoms . a common misunderstanding with the need for these services is that if a child has a vision problem , they 'll tell you . how can they tell you if that 's the only reality they know ? because preventative care is the most important thing we can provide , and we have a way now to conduct it so efficiently and effectively , there 's no reason not to provide this service . i would like to see every state require preventative screenings in order to ensure that every student has an equal opportunity to the best education possible . that 's our way forward . cnn : where does the name of your organization come from ? elliott : when i learned about helen keller for the first time in the fourth grade , i surmised that i am half blind and half deaf like half helen . so that became the nickname from fourth grade on . and then when i graduated from college and i realized what my purpose was in this life , i realized what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf ? helen keller did so many extraordinary things with her life , i can only hope to be half as wonderful as she is . want to get involved ? check out the half-helen foundation website at www.halfhelen.org and see how to help .
minneapolis -lrb- cnn -rrb- unexpected car repairs can blow anyone 's budget . but when you 're struggling to make ends meet , the impact can extend well beyond your bank account . as a social worker in minneapolis , cathy heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients ' health , their jobs , even their homes . for years , she wished someone would do something about the problem . then one day heying realized , `` oh dang , i think that somebody might be me . '' in 2008 , she quit her full-time job and enrolled in automotive school . five years later , armed with a degree in auto technology , heying founded the lift . her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low-income individuals . the approach is simple : heying sells parts at cost , with no markup , and charges $ 15 an hour for labor ; the going rate in minneapolis is around $ 100 an hour . the result ? big savings for her customers . and for those who ca n't pay in full , she will work out payment plans . to date , heying has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low-income individuals , saving them more than $ 170,000 and keeping them on the road to success . do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 . i talked with heying about her career change and what she 's learned from her work . below is an edited version of our conversation . kathleen toner : one day you 're a social worker , the next you 're in automotive school . what was that like ? cathy heying : imagine a scene of a 38-year-old woman and 18-year-old boys . i want to talk about feelings and people , and they want to talk about cars . that sums it up . it was a huge culture shift and a huge knowledge shift . i had to use my brain very differently . i did not grow up working on cars . i did not have a father that wrenched on cars . it was not part of my life growing up . i taught myself a few things -lrb- like -rrb- changing oil . but for the most part , i had no skills around car maintenance . i cried all the way to school the first day 'cause i was like , `` what have i done ? '' so it was terrifying and overwhelming . and at least three solid times in that first quarter , i was like , `` i 'm quitting . i can not do this . '' see more cnn heroes . i give credit , at least in that first quarter , to one of my instructors who 's now on the board of the lift , who kept saying , `` i know that you have a good vision here , and i 'm going to help you get through this . '' and when i really thought about it , going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage , who are living with a broken-down car in subzero weather . basically , i needed to buck up . toner : what 's it like being a mechanic ? heying : it 's physically hard . you find yourself in all sorts of crazy positions , digging under things . you 're lifting tires . you 're wrenching on things . but it is mentally challenging , and it can be really frustrating . because you have all the pieces and for some reason , something is not working , and it 's like , `` what is it ? '' and to really think thoroughly and understand full systems and how those systems play together , it is , i think , way more difficult than i think the average person thinks it is . i think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor . people come in , they give you a list of symptoms . you try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis . and sometimes we get it wrong , but most of the time we get it right . but it is an art and a science mixed into one . it 's a very satisfying job , when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running . at the end of the day , you can feel really good because you can look back and be like , `` this is what i did today . '' toner : you 're also helping some of the mechanics on your staff . how so ? heying : different members of our staff have struggled with poverty and crisis in their own lives . some of them have had interactions with the criminal justice system . two of the three techs that we have i met when they were both experiencing homelessness . and they are all trained , formal , certified technicians . and so that is another piece of the work that we do at the lift . we take a chance on folks who other places might not be willing to take a chance on . toner : you save your clients a lot of money . how do they react ? heying : for the most part , people are ecstatic when they get the bill . and that just makes such a huge difference in people 's lives . we had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car . and he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he did n't have heat in his car . and so it 's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school , even though that 's a really important piece of it . it 's really about protecting people 's lives . for many people , having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together . and it really allows them to remain independent , to remain self-sufficient , to meet the basic needs of their lives and do it with dignity . want to get involved ? check out the lift garage website at www.theliftgarage.org and see how to help .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- angelina jolie 's essay in the new york times revealing that she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to lower her risk of cancer provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media . jolie , 39 , wrote that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer . two years ago , she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons . jolie 's mother died of ovarian cancer , and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population . many were inspired by her decision and her choice to open up about the surgery . others saw an opportunity for helping educate women and advocate for their health , a cause near and dear to jolie 's own heart . some worried for the star , who wrote in her op-ed that `` the fact is i remain prone to cancer . '' the internet being what it is , others took jolie 's announcement as a chance to mock . most , however , were n't having any of it .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- with its snow-capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets , the bleone valley , where a germanwings jet crashed tuesday , is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot . tiny villages are scattered along the gorge , which rises from the apple and pear orchards and the gray stone riverbed of the valley floor to heights of more than 2,000 meters -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- above sea level . many of these villages , which were bustling communities in the 19th century , now lie abandoned or survive with just a handful of inhabitants . one dead-end road , the d107 , winds its way through prads-haute-bleone , passing churches and a campsite that offers a peaceful retreat for summer hikers . but the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the germanwings plane difficult . gilles gravier , director of the tourist office in val d'allos , told french newspaper liberation the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the trois eveches mountain , and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area 's slopes . `` there is no access by road ; emergency crews are coming in by air , using helicopters , '' he said . capt. benoit zeisser from the gendarmerie in the nearby town of digne told cnn the aircraft was lying in `` difficult terrain . '' sandrine boisse , the president of the tourism office at the pra loup ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened . `` it was about 11 -lrb- a.m. -rrb- here . i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , '' she said . `` and at first we thought it was an avalanche , but it was strange at this time because it was 11 . `` something was wrong . ... we did n't know what . '' her husband was skiing nearby and saw a plane flying at low altitude , she said . french president francois hollande warned `` it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site . '' photographs posted on twitter hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off , and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims ' remains . the bodies of those on board the plane are expected to be taken to the gymnasium at the local high school in seyne les alpes , some 10 kilometers -lrb- 6 miles -rrb- from the crash site , which will be used as a temporary morgue . french police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site , urging them `` not to clutter the roads , '' leaving them clear for emergency vehicles .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a 30-year-old california woman was abducted from a male acquaintance 's residence in the bay area and is being held for ransom , police said tuesday . the male acquaintance , also 30 , witnessed the kidnapping of denise louise huskins from the vallejo home , and he is not a suspect in the case , said vallejo police lt. kenny park . `` ms. huskins ' whereabouts are unknown , and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom , '' park told reporters . `` we 're worried about ms. huskins ' welfare . we do n't know where she 's at . and that 's why we 're coming to the public asking for their help . '' huskins , who has been living in vallejo the past year , is from huntington beach in southern california , police said . she works as a physical therapist , police added . she is employed at a kaiser hospital , cnn affiliate kgo reported , citing her facebook page . a cousin of huskins , amy mattison , told cnn affiliate kpix that the 30-year-old man is huskins ' boyfriend and she was abducted from his residence . park declined to comment on the nature of the relationship between huskins and the 30-year-old man who saw and reported the kidnapping . about 75 people from the solano county search and rescue team were searching for huskins in nearby woods and on mare island , park said . huskins ' 2000 white toyota camry was found in vallejo and may have been moved from the residence , park said . authorities do n't know when her vehicle was moved , police said . park did n't disclose the amount of the ransom being sought . `` all i can tell is there was a ransom demand , '' park said . police are asking the public 's help in locating huskins , who was described as white , 5-foot-7 , 150 pounds , with blond hair and blue eyes . vallejo police asked the fbi to help their investigation . cnn 's stella chan contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- idaho wildlife officials have retrieved 2,000 dead snow geese that fell from the sky this week . the birds , whose carcasses were collected over the weekend , appear to have died of avian cholera , the idaho department of fish and game said tuesday . `` the migratory birds were on the return leg of their migration from the southwestern united states and mexico to their breeding grounds on the northern coast of alaska , '' said steve schmidt , a regional supervisor . they died near dubois , terreton and roberts -- all in the eastern part of the state . it 's unclear where the geese picked the bacteria from , but authorities are scrambling to ensure that other birds do n't feed on the carcasses and spread the disease . `` the important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible , to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds , '' schmidt said . `` biologists observed about 20 eagles in the vicinity of some of the carcasses . because of a delayed incubation period it is uncertain where these eagles might be located , if and when the avian cholera affects them .

'' we live by a credo that `` freedom is n't free , '' and that our constitution is worth dying for . how inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the eagle 's wings . unfortunately , whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort , we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts . the latest example : nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song . immediately , the university of oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech . forget whether you like the speech or not . that is not relevant . these boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song , on their own time , in a privately rented bus , simply because the government did n't like the content of their song . opinion : what 's the right way to face racism ? censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise . what surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions , and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the first amendment on its head , because of nine seconds of video . i do n't like the song or its message either . i ca n't imagine anyone reasonable who would . but i want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not i should be punished , based on what words i used . that is not freedom . i understand that most of us hate racism . we are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners . but i am not willing to trade the first amendment for a society where we do n't need to hear racist words . in abrams v. united states , justice oliver wendell holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty-based view toward free speech , and which became the dominant theory in first amendment jurisprudence . in abrams , holmes gave us `` the marketplace of ideas . '' and what a brilliant theory it was . holmes noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right , then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views . `` if you have no doubt of your premises or your power , and want a certain result with all your heart , you naturally express your wishes in law , and sweep away all opposition . '' those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right . i believe in a racism-free world . i have marched in counterprotests against the ku klux klan . i 've stood up in places you do n't want to be , against violent neo-nazis . and i would do it again . but i feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the first amendment to fight racism . some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts . unfortunately , that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay . i am not . as certain as i am that my views on race are correct , i can not shake holmes ' wisdom from my mind . he wrote : . `` but when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out . that , at any rate , is the theory of our constitution . '' for that reason , i would gladly protest against the kkk , but i would never abide any government official denying the kkk its right to speak . i understand those who would wish to do so . they want to eradicate racism , and the end will justify the means . however , we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements . of course , some say that these were more than `` offensive . '' the song was a `` threat . '' after all , it did mention lynching black people . but was that really a threat ? an idiotic ditty in an all-white bus ? to call it a threat is disingenuous . what about the disruptive nature of the song ? should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them , and who carry these offensive racist thoughts ? yes . they should be free to have these thoughts , they should be free to say these things . if it crosses the line into action , or even imminent incitement to action , that 's another story . in this case , that never happened . the first amendment prevails here . opinion : the danger society does n't talk about . it is easy to claim that these sigma alpha epsilon boys did not deserve first amendment protection . many have said so . but , when you hear that , your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism . the first amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility . in fact , it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges . it is there for the kkk , the nazis , sae , and you alike . it is there for words that shock us , challenge us , and that bother us . you should want to protect the sae boys -- not that they deserve it . you should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular . once , speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be `` bad speech . '' once , professors were kicked off campus for not being `` anti-gay enough . '' but , today , the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace . let that victory stand , without trying to cement it with the force of law , and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these `` good thoughts '' to flourish in the first place .
hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- nestled in a tranquil hillside , hong kong 's newest buddhist monastery features bulletproof vip rooms and the world 's second tallest statue of the goddess of mercy -- a buddhist deity . the monastery is funded entirely by asia 's richest man , li ka-shing , who contributed $ 193 million from his personal foundation to the building project . the premises , styled on tang dynasty buildings , sprawl across a lush , green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields . it can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily , but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere . li initiated the project in 2003 to promote buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete . at a height of 76 meters -lrb- 250 feet -rrb- , the goddess of mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of hong kong 's harbor and several islands . the monastery also features several grand halls , including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated buddhist statues , where people can meditate , and learn about buddhism . but perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms . one of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect `` important guests . '' `` we installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the supreme patriarch of thailand and other top monks , '' walter ngai kai-shu , secretary general of the monastery told local media . the rooms are still empty , and ngai added that they were not designed for li or any specific individual , reported the south china morning post . visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks , meat , alcohol , or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly -- instead the monastery will provide water . `` there are many other ways to offer the buddha apart from joss sticks , '' ngai told local media . currently , a dozen monks , mainly from hong kong and southeast asia reside inside the monastery . it will be open to the public on april 15 , but registration and booking is now available online . cnn 's shen lu contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a group of foreign medical students are thought to have traveled to syria to work in isis-controlled hospitals , a turkish lawmaker told cnn sunday . the group of 11 people includes seven britons , an american , a canadian and two sudanese , mehmet ali ediboglu said . ediboglu , an opposition turkish lawmaker , told the observer that he had spoken with the students ' families , who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for isis and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring syria . `` they have been cheated , brainwashed . that is what i , and their relatives , think , '' ediboglu said , according to the newspaper . but he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle . `` let 's not forget about the fact that they are doctors , '' he told the observer . `` they went there to help , not to fight . '' eight of the group are medical students who 've just graduated and three others are in their final year of medical school , he said . they 'd been studying in khartoum , sudan . now , at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the turkey-syria border , pleading for their return , according to the observer . in an interview published monday in turkey 's hürriyet daily news , the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave turkey without their children . dr. maumoon abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter , lena , who is one of the students . `` i know you want to help people and be of use . but you can do this in another way , '' he told the newspaper . `` there are many who need your help . but this is not the way . please , come back . '' british officials said they are aware of the report . `` we are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts , '' the british foreign & commonwealth office said in a statement . officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join isis ' ranks . estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by . last year , a 19-year-old colorado woman was arrested at denver international airport as she was about to embark on a journey to an isis camp , where she hoped to serve as a nurse . cnn 's nimet kirac and radina gigova contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- an online group claiming affiliation with islamic state terrorists has threatened american military members and their families in the past , and over the weekend , a new threat surfaced on the web . a group calling itself the islamic state hacking division posted the names , photos and addresses of about 100 u.s. troops online , calling for attacks against them . the file , posted online saturday before being removed , claimed to have hacked military databases and said it was leaking 100 names `` so that our brothers residing in america can deal with you . '' the possibility of lone-wolf attacks in the united states , the type that this message calls for , is a threat officials take seriously . a u.s. law enforcement official said that all 100 or so troops named in the file are being contacted . it is believed that isis members and sympathizers have been scouring social media sites trying to glean as much information as possible about service members , and have even threatened the spouses of military personnel online . one military wife recalls recently staying up all night and deleting every facebook picture of her children , every post that mentioned them or where they went to school . she googled herself , trying to figure out how easy it would be to find where the family lived . in the morning , she went to her car and scraped the military decal off the front window . as the spouse of a special forces soldier , she 's always tried to be conscious of how much she advertises that she and her three young children are a military family . `` it 's hard because i am so proud of what my husband does , but lately so many spouses that i know are actually scared that they could be targets of isis or someone who sympathizes with isis , '' she told cnn in january , asking that cnn keep her name out of the story for that reason . pro-isis hackers have never been responsible for a major cyber breach but some experts worry their capabilities are growing . j.m. berger , co-author of `` isis : the state of terror , '' told cnn , `` there are indications some former members of anonymous and teamp0ison -lrb- another hacking group -rrb- are now hacking on behalf of isis . '' the large majority of those within such hacking collectives are thought to hold very different views . in the wake of the attack against the charlie hebdo satirical magazine in paris in january , hackers affiliated with anonymous declared online war on isis and al qaeda . regarding this weekend 's threat targeting troops , the naval criminal investigative service notified the marines named in the file , a marine corps spokesman said . but the spokesman told cnn that the threat has yet to be verified . the navy reminded service members to limit the amount of personal information they share online . on sunday , a defense department official told cnn that it can not confirm the validity of the posting of troops ' information , but said it is investigating . the fbi is also looking into the post , a law enforcement official told cnn , adding there are questions about the credibility of the person or persons who posted it . in january , military families were spooked by an online message on central command 's twitter account which was in all caps . it read : `` american soldiers , we are coming . watch your back . isis . '' the tweet included a link to a statement that said , in part , `` we wo n't stop ! we know everything about you , your wives and children . u.s. soldiers ! we 're watching you ! '' the twitter hacker managed to post other threatening messages , propaganda videos and some military documents until the accounts were disabled . central command quickly made public assurances that it was relatively easy to hack twitter , no serious security details were revealed and it would find who was behind the hack . army wife ashley broadway-mack said the messages just amplified the anxiety she already feels after recent terror attacks targeting military personnel , law enforcement officers and civilians . she and other family members told cnn in january that they first began to think about the possibility in may 2013 when a uniformed british soldier in london was murdered by two men who shouted `` allahu akbar , '' or `` god is great . '' others started to fear the possibility of their service members or themselves being targeted after the killing of a canadian soldier during an october attack on the country 's parliament . attacks and plots in australia have them concerned , too , they said . in september , the australian prime minister said a plot to kidnap a member of the public , behead the victim and then drape him or her in an isis flag had been thwarted . in december , a self-styled muslim cleric held hostages in a sydney cafe for 17 hours , a drama that ended with the deaths of two hostages . the gunman , who was known for sending hate mail to military families , was killed . the slayings in paris , for which al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has taken responsibility , have prompted broadway-mack to think about security at north carolina 's fort bragg . `` before the incident in canada , i honestly did n't think isis was a threat to our family or other military families , '' she said in january . `` i worry about the hundreds , thousands of folks going to and from work in uniform . they , too , could be targets . i think of other areas around the country where there 's a large military presence -- an attack , ambush , lone terrorist is something i fear . `` i hate to say it , but i honestly no longer think if , but when and where , '' she said . `` i think it 's only a matter of time . '' in late november , the fbi issued a warning to u.s. military members that isis was calling for attacks against them , a law enforcement source told cnn . the source said that `` overseas based individuals are looking for like-minded individuals in the u.s. to carry out these attacks . '' the warning asked members of the military to `` review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists . '' the bulletin also said authorities were concerned that isis members were `` spotting and assessing '' individuals in the united states who may be interested in carrying out attacks inside the country against members of the military , a u.s. counterterror official told cnn . lori volkman , who is married to a commanding officer , told cnn in january that she she knows military members and spouses who have stopped openly carrying their uniforms to their car after a visit to the dry cleaners . some have stopped wearing clothing with military insignia and are more careful when they open their wallet to avoid showing military ids or payment cards . the small , simple changes do n't mean military family members are running scared , volkman said . but it was difficult when her young daughter was watching television and saw the news about the centcom hack and the threat that isis was coming for soldiers . `` she turned and looked at me and you could see it registering -- we 're soldiers . she had a very worried look , '' volkman said . `` but kids are comforted by whatever their parents tell them . we ca n't live our lives in fear and we try to reassure them . '' a blogger and communications firm ceo , volkman wondered how she would even begin to scrub her online presence . angela mccormick ricketts also said in january that she 's thrown her hands up about the matter of online privacy . her memoir , `` no man 's war '' is a critical success . she 's done a lot of press and is omnipresent online . `` i 'm probably screwed if isis starts targeting yappy military spouses , so it 's too late now ! there 's also a part of me that thinks that 's what they want -- to make us always looking over our shoulders . so no . no to all of it , '' she said . it 's a matter of principle , she and others said . why should families bend to fear and stop sharing online when social media has helped many of them get through 14 years of nonstop war ? though the military has at times struggled with how much freedom its members should have on social media , relatives have wholeheartedly embraced it . military families appear to use social media at higher rates than civilians , according to data from the pew research center . social media as we now know it was n't even around when the afghanistan war began . facebook launched in 2004 , almost exactly a year after the united states invaded iraq . now , dozens of military spouses have blogs and facebook caters to the community . a 2014 survey by military advocacy group blue star families found that 75 % of 6,200 respondents considered the use of social media to be very important . cnn 's paul cruickshank , mariano castillo , barbara starr , kevin bohn , mary kay mallonee , pamela brown and jim sciutto contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- earlier this month , shahindokht molaverdi , iran 's vice president for women and family affairs , led an official delegation to the united nations in new york to attend the 59th session of the commission on the status of women . in her march 11 speech to the commission , molaverdi said that `` the islamic republic of iran has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status ... on its agenda . '' molaverdi described the significant progress iranian women have made in education and science , citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women 's rights . there was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including iran 's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving iranian women of real gender equality and empowerment . unfortunately , molaverdi 's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality . on the day she delivered her speech , amnesty international released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before iran 's parliament that would further restrict women 's rights . one would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country 's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed `` traditional '' families in society . the other would `` further entrench gender-based discrimination , particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children , '' amnesty said . a day later , the u.n. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in iran , ahmed shaheed , released his fourth report to the u.n. human rights council describing the dire state of human rights in the country . his report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that human rights watch and others had raised during iran 's 2014 universal periodic review , a review of every u.n. state 's human rights record every four years by the human rights council . the sobering reality , all too familiar to molaverdi , is that iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives , ranging from issues related to marriage , divorce , inheritance and child custody , to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators . the proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women 's rights in recent years . to many , the discrepancy between what molaverdi said in her speech , and what women face in iran , smacked of diplomatic subterfuge . activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women 's rights in iran , and called out molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that iranian women face . yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind-the-scenes struggle that molaverdi , who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women 's rights at home , and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much-needed space for iran 's beleaguered rights activists . just two days before the u.n. session , iran 's conservative kayhan daily , thought to be close to the office of supreme leader ayatollah khamenei , published an article that showed just what iran 's women 's rights activists are up against . the author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the u.n. commission , describing its notion of `` gender equality '' as `` unacceptable to the islamic republic . '' the article accused molaverdi of `` negligence '' for participating in events that could damage iran 's reputation and interests , and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by iran 's security and intelligence agencies . what 's striking about kayhan 's attack is that iran 's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups , including women 's rights activists . groups like the one million signatures campaign , a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women , were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious `` national security '' grounds . but those hostile to women 's rights in iran remain unrelenting . anyone who fails , willingly or unknowingly , to heed their threats may face reprisals , as several activists who attempted to attend similar u.n. events in previous years found out . yet kayhan 's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women 's groups in iran as they continue to challenge the state 's monopoly on the women 's rights narrative . while iranian women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution , their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education , health care , and birth control . the image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by iran 's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many iranian women today . so while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what molaverdi said at the united nations , and what iranian women face , let us not lose sight of another reality : the paradox that exists in iran between the state 's regressive laws and policies against women , and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied . that effort , at the very least , deserves our respect .
united nations -lrb- cnn -rrb- tour groups and diplomats breeze past a nondescript display of 35 blown-up photos printed on poster board . suddenly , one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos : a man whose eyes have been gouged out . manjula sharma , visiting the united nations from india , gasps when she realizes what she is looking at . `` how could anybody do this ? '' she said , while looking at the photos with a pained expression . `` it 's not war . it 's not drought . it 's not natural calamity . it 's torture . '' the exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the u.n. secretariat building . it 's a no-frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called `` caesar , '' a syrian government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police . caesar claimed to take up to 50 photos a day , and brought nearly 27,000 images like these out of the country . captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals , and accuse syrian president bashar al-assad 's regime in the torture and killings . the photos show emaciated bodies . some have eyes gouged out , some have genitals removed . and many are covered with wounds , the flesh peeling from their bodies . it 's a sight that gave pause to anders frantzen , who works at the united nations and was running late to a meeting . `` i told myself i really wanted to come back here and take a proper look . it looks like something you have n't seen since the second world war . it 's very bad , '' frantzen said . `` it 's difficult to put a face , an image to the numbers we hear about . so you see these pictures -lrb- and -rrb- it sort of puts things in a new perspective . '' while the photos have been shown before congress and in media reports , many people , like sharma , had no idea they existed . that 's partly why mouaz moustafa , senior political adviser to the coalition for a democratic syria , said he placed the photos in this location . he wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on u.n. security council member states to vote for the international criminal court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in syria . `` if you ask anyone about isis from mississippi to alabama , everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity , '' moustafa said . `` if you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the assad regime , it does n't get , i feel , it does n't get the same coverage . '' the syrian mission to the united nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit . the exhibit will be at the united nations until march 24 .

'' listeriosis , a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the cdc . symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms , according to the cdc . in the united states , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year ; approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth . the cdc advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away . in a statement on its website , blue bell said `` this recall in no way includes blue bell ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz . cups .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson 's police chief is gone . so is the city manager . and the top court clerk was fired for sending racist emails . but are these high-level changes enough to satisfy all residents ? absolutely not , they say . protesters amassed in front of the ferguson police department on wednesday night , demanding the entire force be disbanded and calling for mayor james knowles to step down . `` racist cops have got to go , '' some chanted . `` the people , united , will never be defeated , '' others said . amid the protests , two officers were shot -- one in the face , the other in the shoulder . they were hospitalized in serious condition , and it 's not clear who the shooter was . so what will it take to calm ferguson ? deray mckesson told cnn that protesters want the entire police department dissolved . mckesson was part of a group that appeared to be the largest crowd since november when a grand jury decided not to indict officer darren wilson for shooting michael brown , an unarmed black teenager . the killing was the spark that started a national wildfire of dialogue about police brutality . many have decried rampant racism within the ferguson police department . and a scathing 102-page justice department report backed up some of their claims -- citing widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks , including targeting them disproportionately for tickets . on wednesday , police chief thomas jackson announced he 's stepping down , effective march 19 . he 'll still get one year 's worth of pay and insurance . cnn legal analyst mark o'mara said the entire department needs to be gutted . `` the department of justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department can not be ignored , and the problems it reveals can not be fixed from the inside , '' o'mara wrote . `` if there are a few good cops in the ferguson police department , they need to leave , and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization . '' but city officials believe the police department can be reformed without being eliminated , the mayor told reporters . `` we continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was , '' knowles said . `` the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity , '' he added . `` we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness . '' even if protesters get their wishes -- the resignation of knowles and the disbanding of the police department -- they still wo n't get what they originally wanted : charges against wilson . a local grand jury decided not to indict wilson in november for the shooting death of brown , who died august 9 . the justice department launched its own investigation to see if there were any federal civil rights violations . `` there is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove wilson 's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety '' when he shot brown , the justice department report said . wilson resigned from the police department in november , citing security concerns . but he remains a controversial figure in ferguson . when resident sue schmidt defended wilson at tuesday 's city council meeting , she heard vocal objections from the crowd . `` i 'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe darren wilson an apology , '' schmidt said , prompting laughter by some in the audience . `` the same justice report that you 're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100 % . '' it 's not clear who else may resign or get fired after the critical justice department report , which said ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration and city council -- to raise revenue through increased ticketing and fining . read the department of justice report . the investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by ferguson police and court officials . one november 2008 email said president barack obama would n't likely be president for long because `` what black man holds a steady job for four years . '' another email joked that african-american women should use abortion to control crime . `` our investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined , '' the justice department 's report said . after the report came out , the city 's top court clerk was fired for sending racist emails , and two others were being investigated , the mayor said . but the mayor has n't resigned -- to the ire of many protesters wednesday night . `` you got rid of jackson , but we want knowles '' gone , protester kayla reed said . knowles said other reforms are already underway in an attempt to `` move this city , its residents and our entire community forward . '' but the community is clearly at odds about how to move forward .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- latest developments : . full story : . saudi arabia has launched military operations in neighboring yemen , where for months houthi rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government , the saudi ambassador to the united states told reporters in washington on wednesday . adel al-jubeir said the operation consisted of airstrikes on more than one city and in more than one region . yemen , a longtime stronghold for one of al qaeda 's most dangerous branches , has been plunged into chaos since the houthi rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months . the unrest has led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces from yemen , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there . how did yemen get to this place ? `` we are determined to protect the legitimate government of yemen , '' al-jubeir said . `` having yemen fail can not be option for us or for our coalition partners . '' a leading member of the houthis ' political wing , ansar allah , said force will be met with force . `` this is a clear aggression and we will respond by a counteraggression , '' ali al imad told cnn arabic . `` the saudi move will unite all the people of yemen against the saudis and the kingdom will pay the price . '' if the saudis try to invade with ground troops , he said , they will fail . `` they probably will try to avoid that , but if it happened then they will pay a very high price , '' imad said . the saudi airstrikes appear to be targeting military compounds , headquarters and weapons storage areas . journalist hakim almasmari , who is staying in the capital of sanaa , said hundreds of explosions have caused residents to stay in their homes . `` i do expect the sanaa of a couple of hours ago to be a different sanaa in the morning , '' he said . a senior arab diplomat told cnn that the gulf cooperation council soon will issue a statement that the yemenis have asked for military assistance and the gcc is prepared to step in . it will be signed by all gcc countries except for oman . not all countries will contribute military forces , the source said . arab and senior administration officials from the united states told cnn that an interagency u.s. coordination team is in saudi arabia . the sources said the saudis have not specified what they want yet , but will likely ask for american air support , satellite imagery , and other intelligence . `` we can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that , but there will be no military intervention by the u.s. , '' a senior administration official said . al-jubeir said the united states is not involved in the airstrikes against the houthis , who are shiites in a majority sunni nation . but the coalition includes more than 10 nations , he said , meaning more than the six gcc countries will be involved . yemen , which has been in turmoil for months , shares a border with southern saudi arabia . `` we hope that the wisdom will prevail among the houthis and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over yemen and destroy it , '' al-jubeir said . earlier wednesday , rebel forces captured parts of the port city of aden and a nearby yemeni air base recently evacuated by u.s. forces , officials in the country said , with one rebel spokesman claiming that yemen 's president fled aden as his opponents advanced . the rebels late wednesday morning captured al-anad air base , an installation that the last yemen-based contingent of u.s. special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country , said mohammed abdulsalam , a spokesman for the houthi rebels . the rebel forces -- houthis and some allies in the yemeni military -- then advanced on aden , the nearby port city where president abdu rabu mansour hadi had taken refuge for weeks . there were conflicting reports wednesday about hadi 's whereabouts . but one houthi spokesman , mohammed albukhaiti , said hadi left aden on a boat with a saudi diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city . albukhaiti told cnn that hadi went to riyadh , saudi arabia . but a saudi arabian source told cnn 's nic robertson that the president was still in yemen in the early hours thursday . earlier , u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters , `` it 's pretty clear -lrb- hadi -rrb- left voluntarily , '' without saying where hadi had gone . she clarified that circumstances in yemen caused him to leave his residence , but that rebels did not expel him . two senior administration officials said it 's unclear if he left aden . the rebels ' advance illustrated the growing power the houthis have enjoyed since taking over sanaa in january , and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key u.s. ally in the fight against then yemen-based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . for years , yemen had allowed u.s. drones and special operations forces to stalk aqap in the country . now , that arrangement is in tatters , along with any semblance of peace in the middle eastern nation . underscoring rebels ' increasing strength , houthi-commanded yemeni air force jets on wednesday dropped bombs on or fired missiles at the presidential palace in aden for the third time in a week , causing minimal damage and injuring no one , two hadi aides said . the airstrikes happened before reports of hadi 's departure from aden emerged . hadi had been staying at the aden palace since last month , when he fled the capital , sanaa , after a houthi takeover there . the united states `` strongly condemn -lrb- s -rrb- the recent offensive military actions taken in yemen that have targeted president hadi , '' psaki told reporters wednesday . the houthi militants -- shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country -- moved into the capital , sanaa , in september , sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called . in january , they surrounded the presidential palace and hadi resigned and was put under house arrest . but hadi escaped in february , fleeing to aden and declaring that he remained the country 's leader . the houthis took control of military forces stationed near sanaa , including the air force . some of the forces aligned with the houthis also are loyal to hadi 's predecessor , former president ali abdullah saleh , who resigned in 2012 after months of `` arab spring '' protests inspired in part by a 2011 revolution in egypt . by last week , opposing yemeni military forces -- those loyal to the houthis , and those answering to hadi -- battled in aden , with hadi 's forces temporarily pushing out the rebels on march 19 after at least 13 people were killed . on wednesday , with the u.s. forces gone , houthi-aligned forces took over al-anad air base , about 40 kilometers from aden , said abdulsalam , one of the houthi spokesmen . the number of casualties , if any , was n't immediately available . some hadi supporters evacuated the base , and houthi forces arrested some top officials who were there , including hadi 's defense minister , abdulsalam said . no deaths or injuries were immediately reported in the rebels ' subsequent takeover of aden 's airport and the central bank . cnn 's elise labott , becky anderson , nick paton walsh , greg botelho , michael pearson , anas

-lrb- cnn -rrb- formula one star fernando alonso will not race in the season-opening australian grand prix on the advice of doctors treating him for the effects of a high-speed crash . the double world champion was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his mclaren at the penultimate winter test in barcelona last month . the spaniard is now recovering at home but doctors have indicated returning to racing in melbourne three weeks after after the high impact could be too risky . alonso commented on twitter : `` it will be tough not to be in australia , but i understand the recommendations . a second impact in less than 21 days `` no '' . mclaren explained in a statement : `` fernando 's doctors have recommended to him that , following the concussion he sustained on february 22nd , for the time being he should seek to limit as far as is possible any environmental risk factors that could potentially result in his sustaining another concussion . '' kevin magnussen -- who effectively lost his seat to alonso when the spaniard returned to mclaren after his ferrari exit -- will race alongside jenson button in the australian grand prix on march 15th . alonso 's return to the starting grid in mclaren colors has been delayed by his freakish crash at the circuit de catalunya , home to the spanish grand prix . mclaren had explained that alonso 's `` accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time . '' turn three , where the accident took place , is an area of the circuit where cross winds are known to affect the balance of the cars . the 33-year-old posted a video on social media on friday to thank his fans for his support and update them on his condition . standing in a garden , a smiling alonso said : `` as you can see i 'm completely fine . i will rest and keep you updated next week with progress and see you very soon on the track . '' but his return to the racing asphalt has now been delayed until at least the malaysian grand prix at the end of march despite doctors saying he has no symptoms of illness . `` having performed an exhaustive series of tests and scans -- some of them as recently as yesterday evening -- alonso 's doctors have informed him that they find him asymptomatic of any medical issue ; that they see no evidence whatsoever of any injury , '' mclaren said in a statement . `` they therefore describe him as entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives alike . '' however , in order to limit the risk of a secondary concussion alonso has accepted the advice not to race but has continued his preparations for the new f1 season . `` fernando 's doctors acknowledge that he feels fit and well , and that he regards himself as ready to race , '' the statement continued . `` they are comfortable with the fact that he has already recommenced physical training , with a view to preparing for a return to the cockpit of his mclaren-honda car for the malaysian grand prix . indeed , his doctors are supportive of that ambition . '' alonso chose to leave ferrari at the end of the 2014 season and rejoin mclaren , which is also renewing its technical partnership with japanese engine manufacturer honda for 2015 . the spaniard -- regarded by his peers as the best driver on the grid -- is chasing a third world crown but , so far , he has not had chance to gauge the possibilities of realizing that ambition with mclaren . early reliability problems meant alonso had only completed 117 laps in the mp4-30 race car before his preseason was curtailed by the crash .
kano , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- hundreds of troops from chad and niger launched a ground and aerial offensive against boko haram in northeastern nigeria on sunday , according to residents and military sources from niger . the sweeping offensive is taking place along the niger-nigeria border , sources said , effectively opening a new front in the fight against the islamist terror group . this comes a day after boko haram pledged allegiance to isis in an audio message purported to be from leader abubakar shekau . latest developments in the fight against isis . `` early this morning , troops from niger and chad launched ground and air raids against boko haram into nigeria , and the operation is still continuing , '' said a military official in the border town of diffa , niger . `` it is an intensive operation that is aimed at pulverizing boko haram and crippling their capability , '' according to the source . he spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about the operation . residents said artillery fire and fighter jets pushed boko haram fighters into the damasak district of nigeria , which is a boko haram enclave . `` around 6 a.m. , soldiers from niger and chad in huge numbers confronted boko haram around the doutchi area outside diffa and later crossed the bridge into nigeria , '' said diffa resident ari boubakarna . `` we heard huge explosions from artillery fire and fighter jets , but the explosions receded as the troops moved further into nigeria , '' boubakarna continued . a journalist working in diffa saw troops headed toward the border with nigeria , where boko haram fighters had taken up positions . `` they left in a huge convoy of over 200 vehicles , some of them fitted with machine guns , including armored tanks , ambulances , water tankers and cargo trucks , which indicate they were going for a prolonged operation , '' the journalist said . residents lined up the streets to offer water and tea as the troops drove out of diffa , residents said , adding that soldiers promised to capture shekau alive . another contingent of troops , backed by air support , moved out from the town of bosso , niger , according to residents . `` soldiers in large numbers crossed into nigeria this morning , and we could hear thunderous sounds of gunfire and explosions coming from the direction of malam fatori , '' bosso resident tandja moumouni said . nigeria and its neighbors have recently mounted a coordinated offensive against boko haram militants in the borno state , where the islamist group has seized a large swathe of territory . nigeria shares a border with niger , chad and cameroon there . as a part of this alliance , thousands of troops from niger and chad were stationed in bosso and diffa in january . the offensive has succeeded in reclaiming some of the territory seized by the group . nigeria has vowed to liberate all of its territories from boko haram before the general elections , which begin on march 28 , to enable displaced residents return to their homes for the elections .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- with tensions running high after the shooting of two officers in ferguson , missouri , state and county police took over protest security in the st. louis suburb thursday . st. louis county police and the missouri state highway patrol are assuming `` command of the security detail regarding protests , '' st. louis county police said , while ferguson police will remain responsible for `` routine policing services '' in the city . the takeover came less than a day after two police officers standing guard outside ferguson police headquarters were shot in what st. louis county police chief jon belmar called an `` ambush , '' spurring a manhunt for those responsible for targeting the line of officers . `` we could have buried two police officers , '' belmar told reporters . '' ... i feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was . '' belmar said several people `` have been very forthright '' with investigators , but authorities have n't released the names of any possible suspects . investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting , and one of them might be the shooter , a law enforcement official said . police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away . this is n't the first time that county police and state troopers have stepped in to handle protest security . when clashes between police and protesters boiled over last year , missouri 's governor declared a state of emergency and tapped the state highway patrol to take over . after that emergency declaration expired in december , ferguson police resumed command of protest security . officers from other agencies have continued to provide backup at larger protests . at a candlelight vigil thursday night near the scene of the shooting , religious leaders led prayers for the wounded police officers and protesters . dozens of demonstrators gathered again outside the police headquarters thursday night . this time , jeff roorda of the st. louis police officers association said , the security situation on the streets is different . `` it 's a very tense situation , as you can well imagine , '' he told cnn 's `` the situation room . '' `` in my communications as a union official with police commanders , i 've been assured that tactics will be different tonight . i assume that means not only more officers , but a wider perimeter , with coverage , perhaps , of these blind spots from which the shots were fired last night . '' shots rang from a hill overlooking the station out shortly after midnight wednesday , at the end of a protest against the ferguson police department . officers saw `` muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away , '' belmar said . protesters have disavowed any ties to the shooting , saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence . `` as the protest was dying down , someone , somewhere got violent . now who they were and what group they were affiliated with , we do n't know , '' said antonio french , a st. louis alderman . `` in no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting . '' belmar believes someone targeted the police , who have faced heated criticism for months , for a reason . `` these police officers were standing there , and they were shot just because they were police officers , '' he said . that department has been under fire since one of its officers , darren wilson , shot and killed black teen michael brown in august , and more recently since a scathing u.s. department of justice report came out documenting a pattern of racial discrimination . police chief thomas jackson resigned from his post wednesday . while the demonstrators ' focus was ferguson , neither of the wounded officers works in that st. louis suburb 's police department . one is from webster groves , a city about 13 miles south of ferguson . the officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , belmar said . the other wounded officer was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back , belmar said . he is a 41-year-old from st. louis county police who has been in law enforcement for the past 14 years . both men were treated and released from st. louis ' barnes jewish hospital . brown 's parents condemned the shooting as `` senseless , '' saying such violence against law enforcement `` will not be tolerated . '' so did the white house , with a tweet signed with president barack obama 's initials offering prayers for the wounded officers and calling `` violence against police ... unacceptable . '' and u.s. attorney general eric holder , who visited ferguson in the aftermath of brown 's shooting and unrest that spurred , decried what happened as a `` heinous and cowardly -lrb- and -rrb- repugnant attack . '' `` what happened last night was a pure ambush , '' holder said . `` this was not someone trying to bring healing to ferguson . this was a damn punk who was trying to sow discord . '' iresha turner says police banged on her door in the middle of the night . `` i opened the door and stood back . i look at my chest , there 's a red dot on it , '' she said . `` i have my hands up , start crying . i said , ` please , do n't shoot me . '' turner was one of three people who were questioned for hours by investigators thursday and eventually released . but they never saw the shooting and had no idea who opened fire , she said . turner thinks police questioned her because she was in a car of people who sped away after the shooting -- not because they had anything to do with it , she said , but because they were scared after hearing gunshots . it 's not known what connection , if any , the shooter or shooters had to wednesday night 's protest . one irony is that , for some protesters , wednesday was a day to celebrate : they 'd called for jackson 's resignation for months , and finally it was happening . but for others , it was not enough . that 's why they congregated in ferguson , to demand changes like disbanding the city 's entire police department and ousting mayor james knowles . some chanted , `` racist cops have got to go . '' others held signs with slogans such as `` they do n't really care about us ! '' and `` black lives matter . '' `` it was a great group -lrb- with -rrb- great , great energy , '' protester markus loehrer said . three were arrested in a crowd belmar characterized as agitated and `` pretty rowdy '' at times . demonstrator deray mckesson told cnn that one fight that occurred had nothing to do with the protests . at its peak , some 150 protesters congregated wednesday night in front of the ferguson police station , belmar said . about 70 law enforcement officers from multiple departments came in to stand in front of the station , as they have on many other nights -- with the turnout of demonstrators the highest since the november grand jury decision not to indict wilson . there 's the manhunt , of course . and then there 's the likelihood of more protests and the possibility of more violence as well . even though jackson , city manager john shaw , ferguson 's top court clerk and two police officers are gone or on their way out , some activists are vowing to keep pressing for change . `` we are n't satisfied with this , '' reed said of the police chief 's exit . `` it 's a step in the right direction , but it 's not what total justice looks like in ferguson . '' jackson expressed optimism that , in his view , the justice department report concluded that ferguson `` can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be . '' but what are the prospects after thursday 's shooting ? loehrer worried that the shooting will undercut the protesters ' message against discrimination and violence . `` it 's a shame that somebody had to take advantage of this great group , '' he said , `` to do something so despicable . '' and belmar said it underscores the fact that , eight months after brown 's death , the streets of ferguson are still simmering and law enforcement officers there are on edge . `` this is beginning at times to be very difficult for any law enforcement agencies , anywhere , to really wrap their arms around , '' he said . `` i want everybody ... to understand how difficult this is .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- even with the national chapter shutting the sigma alpha epsilon house at the university of oklahoma , the school president said the university 's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members . the members have until midnight tuesday to get their things out of the house , university president david boren said in a monday afternoon news conference . `` the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , '' he said , adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members . a saturday video showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization , which both promptly publicized the nine-second clip . david boren : not just another college president . the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant , `` there will never be a ni **** sae . you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . '' by sunday night , sae 's national chapter had suspended the university of oklahoma members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant , but boren took it a step further . he appeared at a campus rally and told students over a bullhorn , `` i have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way . my message to them is : you 're disgraceful . you have violated every principle that this university stands for . '' he said that he was angered , outraged and saddened by what he saw in the video . boren stressed that the fraternity members ' behavior is not indicative of what university of oklahoma students , nicknamed sooners , represent . `` it was unbelievable that this could have possibly occurred with uo students , '' he said . `` sooners are not racists . they 're not bigots . they are people who respect each other and care about each other . '' he called for zero tolerance . `` the only way you put a stop to it is have zero tolerance when it is found out . clearly , i think some of our students wanted this exposed . they wanted this video out there , and i 've asked them to please let me know when they 're other things like this that happen , '' boren told cnn . the student newspaper , the oklahoma daily , received the video in a sunday email , said print editor katelyn griffith . the fraternity celebrated its founder 's day on saturday , and the video showed members traveling to a formal event that evening , she said . `` we decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question , '' she told cnn . `` this was something that we knew would n't be tolerated by the students at ou and the university at large . '' unheard , a campus organization launched in response to the police shooting of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , received the video sunday via anonymous text and immediately moved to `` let our community and our university know that this behavior is not tolerated , that 's it 's unacceptable and it 's extremely , extremely offensive , '' said the group 's co-director , chelsea davis . this mentality is not new to campus , and it 's not confined to one fraternity , davis told cnn , but it 's the first time people have been caught on video . `` unfortunately , it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen , but this is definitely not something that is brand-new . it 's not something that 's only seen within this one organization , '' she said . davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend , as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved . `` i was hurt that my fellow peers that i walk to class with every day , people that i see every day , could say such hateful things about me and my culture , about my friends , about my brothers and my sisters , '' she said . at a news conference , boren said the school was looking into punishing the individuals involved , especially against those `` who have taken a lead '' in the chanting . while expulsion is an option , any punishment must be `` carefully directed '' if it 's to pass constitutional muster . one key will be whether the offending students created a hostile environment on campus , he said . boren emphasized that `` there is no room for racists and bigots '' at oklahoma . `` i think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus , and i hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists , '' he told cnn later . that sentiment echoed throughout campus , as a large crowd of students attended a protest at the university 's north oval , some of them arriving with tape over their mouths with the word , `` unheard , '' written across it . other students took to social media to express their disappointment , with one person urging students to change their profile picture to an image that says in sooner crimson , `` not on our campus , '' the `` ou '' in `` our '' offset in gray . ou is shorthand for the university of oklahoma . unheard posted the video online sunday with the comment , `` racism is alive at the university of oklahoma . '' it was addressed to @president_boren , the university president 's twitter handle . boren quickly threatened to throw the fraternity off-campus if the allegations were true . the sae 's national chapter also moved promptly , saying in a statement it had closed the chapter `` following the discovery of an inappropriate video . '' the group further apologized for the `` unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video . '' `` i was not only shocked and disappointed , but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , '' sae national president bradley cohen said in a statement . a group of students gathered to pray over the racist insults . one of them told cnn affiliate kfor-tv he was `` nauseated , frustrated , '' but he was happy with the sae headquarters ' decision . `` we should be past this . this is disgusting , '' he said . spray paint marked a wall of sae 's fraternity house at the university . `` tear it down , '' the graffiti appeared to say . police posted squad cars in front of the house . members of the oklahoma football team protested , marching in lieu of meeting and practice . backlash extended beyond campus as well , with hip-hop star waka flocka flame saying on instagram that he was canceling an upcoming show for the saes . `` all races partying have a good time and enjoying themselves together peacefully . that 's what waka flocka is all about . for that reason , i must say i 'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the sae fraternity at university of oklahoma and i will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month . racism is something i will not tolerate , '' the atlanta rapper wrote . cnn 's ben brumfield , chuck johnston , nick valencia , tristan milder , lindsey knight , justin lear and emanuella grinberg contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- some of the 100 fraternity brothers of the now-disbanded sigma alpha epsilon chapter at the university of oklahoma have received death threats after the release of a video in which a racist chant was heard , a lawyer for the chapter 's board said friday . attorney stephen jones said other members of the former chapter of the fraternity have been physically assaulted , though he would n't go into specifics . jones told a news conference that he had been retained by the board of trustees -- the alumni advisers for the chapter -- `` to assist them in evaluating certain legal issues and other matters that may impact local chapter of sae . '' there are no plans right now to sue the university , which shut down the chapter 's house and disbanded the sae chapter , he said . the national chapter of sae also revoked the ou chapter 's charter . the school also expelled two members of the fraternity , but jones said he is not representing them . jones said the actions on a nine-second video that showed some members yelling a racist chant that included a reference to lynching were inexcusable . there was `` no justification for what occurred . zero , '' he said . jones said he is involved to protect the due process and first amendment rights of members . the fraternity 's national office said it is investigating the incident in the video to see if it needs to take action against any of the students . `` we are committed to following the due diligence and protocols that we have set forth in our fraternity laws , '' the national sae office said after the news conference , `` as they are designed to enable us to make deliberate , thoughtful decisions that reflect our commitment to our standards and to our members . '' the office also has said it was looking into incidents involving other chapters . `` several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters ... and each of those instances will be investigated , '' the national office said in a statement . it said some of the incidents date back more than 20 years . another chapter of the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity is under fire over alleged racial slurs -- this time in seattle . university of washington students are accusing fraternity members of offensive comments during a protest to raise awareness about racism last month . `` people were called monkeys and apes by members of sae , '' said maggie negussie , president of the university 's black student union . sae 's university chapter denied the allegations , saying an investigation determined the culprits were not members of the fraternity . an investigation into the `` grossly insensitive comments '' is underway , said denzil j. suite , the university 's vice president for student life . the university is gathering information to determine who was behind the remarks , but a preliminary report by some students accused the sae fraternity , according to suite . `` if and when we can determine what occurred , we will take appropriate steps , '' he said . about 1,000 people were marching across the street from the fraternity house when the incident occurred , negussie said . she said the marchers opted to ignore the offensive words . `` at that time it was more important to continue marching ... but that is not the only time , '' she said . `` there are many of us who have those stories . '' negussie also accused the university of washington fraternity of not allowing black students at its parties . when cnn asked for videos or photos , she said members are reaching out to witnesses . michael hickey , president of the fraternity 's university chapter , said the chapter was notified of the protest incident on february 25 -- the same day it happened . `` we were naturally concerned and shocked by these allegations , as we pride ourselves in the diversity of our chapter membership and racism is against the moral ethics of our local and national organization , '' he said in a statement . however , he said , an investigation determined that fraternity members were not behind the insults . the culprits were on a nearby sidewalk and not on the fraternity house property , he said . `` we have determined this due to eyewitness accounts from our members viewing nonmembers of sae yelling offensive comments on the sidewalk near our chapter house , '' he said . he asked witnesses to come forward and pledged to punish any members found to have been involved . `` we continue to seek any information or eyewitnesses to the incident , '' he said . cnn 's elise miller contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- levi pettit , who was expelled from the university of oklahoma for spouting a racist chant at a fraternity activity , says he 's `` deeply sorry . '' `` although i do n't deserve it , i want to ask for your forgiveness , '' pettit said as he read from a prepared statement at a news conference on wednesday . `` there are no excuses for my behavior . i never thought of myself as a racist . i never considered it a possibility . but the bottom line is that the words that were said in that chant were mean , hateful and racist . '' flanked at the podium by african american leaders who he 'd been meeting with at the fairview baptist church in oklahoma city , pettit , who is white , said he planned to spend the rest of his life trying to undo the damage he 'd done . pettit 's parents released a statement apologizing for his behavior earlier this month . but it was n't until wednesday that he spoke out himself . `` some have wondered why i have n't spoken out publicly . the truth is , i 've had a mix of pain , shame , sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions , '' he said . `` i did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country first , until i came here to apologize to the community most directly impacted . '' pettit read from a letter he 'd written the university 's president apologizing for his actions and said he 's committed to taking steps to prevent racism in the future . `` over the past week or so , i 've met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words that i spoke on that bus , '' pettit said . `` meeting with a few people does not change what i did , but it has begun to change me , and my understanding of those hateful words . '' his comments come more than two weeks after a nine-second clip surfaced showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus making racial slurs against blacks . in it , students at the now-disbanded sigma alpha epsilon fraternity at the university of oklahoma clap , pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching . school officials expelled pettit and another student , parker rice , because of their alleged `` leadership role '' in the racist chant . rice has also apologized , saying he 'd made a `` horrible mistake '' and that the chant was `` wrong and reckless . '' pettit declined to answer reporters ' questions wednesday about how he learned the chant , but said he now knows that the words he used never should be repeated . `` i 'm also upset and embarrassed that i failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant . i now have a clear understanding of what lives behind the words , '' he said . `` from this point forward , i will be the leader that i should have been on that bus and stand up against racism in any form .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses ? the u.s. geological survey and the u.s. department of interior this week shared a photo of a weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in erebus bay , antarctica . the expression of the mother is priceless . the photo was taken in october by usgs scientist william link . link , a statistician , was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups . he confirmed friday that the adult seal was the baby 's mom . it 's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo , but link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed , `` so this mom was pretty relaxed , '' link told cnn friday . `` i have a great shot a few seconds later where mom yawned hugely . she looked utterly content , to me . '' the agency 's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media . as the instagram caption notes , the weddell seals of erebus bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years . `` because of its isolation , this population is undisturbed by human activities . the weddell seal population is healthy and stable , and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics . '' link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close . `` i was awed , '' he said . `` it 's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions . it 's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold , high winds , no life to be seen except for the seals , an occasional skua or an emperor penguin . '' after a seal pup is born , link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area , with hardly any interaction with other seals . `` mom does n't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned , and even then does n't get to eat . so while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds , mamma loses about twice that much , '' he said . for more information on the seals , visit weddellsealscience.com .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you think `` my teen would never sext , '' you might be mistaken . and if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high-risk behaviors , like drinking , using drugs or skipping school , keep reading . studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit . more than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sent sexually suggestive texts when they were teenagers , according to the study by drexel university , which was published last year by the journal of sexuality research and social policy . nearly 30 % said they included photos in their sexts , and an astonishing 61 % did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography . another study , this one by the university of texas medical branch at galveston , found that while students who admitted sexting were 32 % more likely to report having sex the next year , sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time . the study , published in the journal pediatrics , found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners , use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control . sexting may be the new `` normal ' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior , the study concluded . `` there are now a few pieces of research , which are sort of converging on the same finding , namely that this is not a rare behavior , '' said elizabeth englander , a professor of psychology at bridgewater state university and director of the massachusetts aggression reduction center . `` i 'm not saying that it 's healthy or that it 's harmless , but it 's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self-esteem are doing it , '' said englander , who researched sexting , as well as a host of other teenager behaviors , for her recent book `` bullying and cyberbullying . '' `` it appears to be widespread . it 's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it 's not very unusual or rare . '' you 're probably thinking : `` i check my kids ' phones . no sexting happening in this household . '' but there are plenty of apps teens can use to send messages their parents ca n't find later . snapchat , cyber dust , vaporchat and others allow users to send messages that disappear on both the sender and recipient 's phones after a certain period of time . these apps are used by kids and adults alike to send a variety of messages -- from perfectly harmless to potentially dangerous . brutally honest : is it ok to spy on your kids ? diana graber , who teaches `` cyber civics '' to middle schoolers in aliso viejo , california , was blown away by the response she got from eighth graders when she , for the first time , included a session on sexting . when she asked her students if they knew what a sext was , everyone in the class said they did , but what they did n't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be , including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states . `` they had no idea what the consequences were , '' said graber , co-founder of cyberwise.org , a digital literacy site for parents , educators , and tweens and teens . `` i mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids , so it occurred to me that no one 's ever bothered to tell these kids they could n't do that . '' graber said she experienced another first that day . a few students wanted to hang around after the class , which is held at the end of the school day , to talk more about sexting and related things . `` that 's never happened to me before with this class ... and i realized that i had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives . '' she now plans to make it part of her `` cyber civics '' curriculum , and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting . it should be part of sex education , she said . `` we know that throwing the book at them , it 's too much too late , so that 's not working , '' said graber , who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships . `` it 's very normal teenage behavior ... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem , and just have these very easy to have discussions . '' englander , the psychology professor and researcher , says in her experience , it 's not that adults are n't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public . the problem , she says , is kids do n't hear the warnings because the reality does n't fit them . in a online article , she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield . since half of car rides do n't result in someone going through the windshield , a person might not listen to that warning , she says . `` if you want to convince somebody that something is a danger , you have to convince them that you know what you 're talking about , '' said englander . `` so you ca n't say to kids ` oh , you are going to go to jail if you sext . ' it 's not 100 % impossible but even in the early cases of sexting , when -lrb- law enforcement -rrb- did prosecute kids , they did n't go to jail . '' `` people have a hard time with this . it 's not that i 'm saying we should n't teach kids that child pornography is a crime . it is a crime , but if we emphasize that that 's the big danger then we 've lost our audience . '' englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext , especially if they felt pressured to do it . in her own research , she said she found that 92 % of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward , but that number is only 68 % for teens who felt pressured into doing it . `` they felt crummy afterwards , '' said englander . `` that was actually the most common result , that they just felt worse . '' lori cunningham , founder of well connected mom , a site specializing in simplifying technology for families , said parents need to remind their children about their own self-worth . `` and that no matter how tempting it is to want to be ` liked ' by someone , they are worth more than degrading themselves for someone else 's enjoyment , '' said cunningham , a mom of two in los angeles . `` if parents are n't having this conversation , their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure . '' cunningham also says parents need to be actively involved in their children 's online lives . in an ebook , she outlines the points parents should go over with their child when they get a phone , including setting up a contract so they understand their phone will be monitored . `` phones are a privilege , not a right . they should only be given to kids with the expectation that mom or dad will be checking it on a daily basis . '' what all the experts believe is that parents and educators should be talking to kids about obeying the law , protecting their privacy and reputation , and respecting everyone 's right to keep their bodies private , but also their own values about the issue . `` your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing , having no idea of what you think is right or wrong , having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it . those are the only two choices , '' said englander . `` i do n't think in today 's world you can assume that they 're never going to run across sexting , they 're never going to see it , they 're never going to know it happens . '' `` that 's a big assumption to make . ''

boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- jurors in the boston marathon bombings trial were shown a key piece of evidence tuesday : dzhokhar tsarnaev 's writings on the inside of the boat he used as a hideout . prosecutors presented photos of three panels of the boat that had messages written in pencil . boston police officer todd brown , a bomb squad member who cleared the boat of explosives , was on the witness stand to talk about the writings . tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the april 15 , 2013 , bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others . a fourth person , an mit police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , allegedly ran from police . tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , was killed after a gunbattle with police . on tuesday , brown identified dzhokhar tsarnaev in court as the man he saw come out of the boat and get taken into custody . in the writings on the panels , some of tsarnaev 's words were struck out by bullet holes . `` i 'm jealous of my brother who ha -lrb- bullet hole -rrb- ceived the reward of jannutul firdaus -lrb- inshallah -rrb- before me , '' one of the writings said , referring to the word for paradise . `` i do not mourn because his soul is very much alive . god has a plan for each person . mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions . '' tsarnaev 's connections : who 's who . tsarnaev 's defense has argued that he indeed participated in the bombings , but that he was influenced by his radicalized brother . in his writings on the boat , tsarnaev asked allah to allow him to reach the highest levels of heaven . `` the us government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that . as a -lrb- bullet hole -rrb- i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished . we muslims are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all . well at least that 's how muhhammad -lrb- bullet hole -rrb- wanted it to be -lrb- for -rrb- ever , '' tsarnaev wrote in the boat . also tuesday , prosecutors called on fbi agent steve kimball to discuss two twitter accounts linked to tsarnaev . one , @j_tsar , contained 1,100 tweets and was the more mainstream of the two . `` i shall die young , '' @j_tsar tweeted on april 12 , 2012 . and four days later , on the day of the 2012 boston marathon , a tweet from the account read , `` they will spend their money & they will regret it & they will be defeated . '' timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath . prosecutors argued that these tweets indicate an attack on the boston marathon was on his mind a year before the bombings . tsarnaev attorney miriam conrad , who opted not to cross-examine the bombing survivors who testified during the first week of the trial , got kimball to acknowledge that some of his information about the tweets came from other agents and that he did n't check them out for himself . conrad also established that some of the tweets appeared to be rap lyrics . cnn 's ann o'neill reported from boston , and mariano castillo wrote in atlanta .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the american civil liberties union is challenging an alabama law that will force those under 18 seeking an abortion to go through an adversarial process that 's akin to a trial . generally , laws in the united states require parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion . but for some children , parental consent is impossible or even dangerous . this class of minors must seek a judicial bypass . while the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states , this alabama law may have gone too far . here are the suspect provisions of this `` bypass by trial '' : . • alabama has turned what is supposed to be an informal , child-centered hearing into more of a trial . • the court can appoint a guardian ad litem -- normally an appointed lawyer for a child in , say , a divorce proceeding or a hearing involving unfit parents -- for the fetus . • the minor may be cross-examined by the district attorney and possibly the minor 's parents . • information about the minor 's pregnancy may be disclosed to her family , friends and employers , and they might even be brought to court to testify -- against the minor . when it comes to abortion , minors are supposed to enjoy the same constitutional right of privacy as adults , free from undue state interference . however , the supreme court has also specifically articulated reasons why the constitutional rights of children are not identical to the rights of adults . children are vulnerable and unable to make critical decisions and , of course , parents have a right to participate in raising their child . states may pass laws that subject minors seeking an abortion to an additional requirement : parental involvement . however , if the state chooses to require parental consent for a pregnant minor to get an abortion , the state also must provide an alternative procedure for obtaining that authorization -- one that `` bypasses '' having to get mom and dad 's permission . the supreme court has required that these hearings `` must assure that resolution ... be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained . '' plus , and perhaps most importantly , the procedure bypassing parental consent can not be a thinly veiled mechanism for an `` absolute , and possibly arbitrary , veto . '' in plain language , hearings must be quick and quiet , and they can not be held in kangaroo court . the problem is , this does not give a lot of detailed direction to courts about how exactly to conduct these hearings . it 's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly , and that sooner or later , a state like alabama would experiment with state abortion law . our system was specifically designed to allow states to experiment with social and economic legislation . of course , that state prerogative is also tempered by a federal court 's power to strike these laws down if they are unconstitutional . in this case , the aclu 's position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far . a hearing is fine , it seems , but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible `` undue burden '' on the right to have an abortion . this has been defined by the courts as placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the adult , or minor child seeking the abortion . the federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether alabama 's law violates established supreme court bypass requirements . but what about the actual bypass requirements themselves ? they are a creation of the supreme court . striking down an act of a state legislature is one thing -- challenging settled supreme court precedent is entirely another . what if the constitutional standards for bypass procedures contain something of an intrinsic paradox ? consider how it applies in this case . in alabama , a judge at one of these hearings is required to waive the parental consent requirement if the judge finds either : . -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the minor is mature and well-informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own ; or . -lrb- 2 -rrb- that performance of the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor . abstract concepts like `` mature '' and `` best interest '' are rather amorphous at best . -lrb- true story : a respected law professor advised many classes of students that when confronted on the bar exam with a question about a child , do the following : write `` best interest of the child '' somewhere in the first sentence ; then write `` whatever the heck you want '' for the rest of the answer . -rrb- . so then , the court must determine whether the minor is mature -- mature enough that she may have the court 's permission to have an abortion . this means the court can then arrive at this kafkaesque , perplexing alternative : a particular minor is too immature to have an abortion -- with the result being that this immature minor ... should therefore be ... a parent of an infant ? it gets stranger : what about a finding that it is in the best interest of the young mother to have the baby , even though she is deemed too immature to have an abortion ? how would it be in the best interest of the immature mother to have a child ? state courts and legislatures are not completely to blame ; after all , the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line-drawing . whether we 're considering the drinking age , the driving age or the voting age , we 've learned over the centuries that kids mature at different ages . plus there is no easy legal formula to address the myriad situations of messed-up families . unfortunately , legislatures must draw some lines -- lines that will not always be workable in every situation . and there are surely situations where the bypass might actually be effective : for example , a very young pregnant minor with completely absent parents , who needs court intervention . the problem is , if it creates an undue burden in one situation , then it 's constitutionally suspect . but ultimately , building up the procedural hurdles for a pregnant minor almost by definition encroaches upon the limits set some time ago by the supreme court . it 's a procedure that needs to be defined ; teen pregnancy certainly is n't going anywhere anytime soon . neither are lousy families , unfortunately . whether the boundary lines of judicial bypass ebb toward the autonomy of minors , or back toward the state interest in the fetus , the broader social `` findings '' of judicial bypass proceedings will always remain the same : it 's all very sad .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- think it 's taking you longer to get to work ? has your job moved farther from your home ? you 're probably right on both counts . a new study from the brookings institution says the number of jobs within a typical commute distance for residents in major metro areas of the u.s. fell by 7 % between 2000 and 2012 . despite trends that indicate a greater desire for millennials to live in dense urban areas , suburbs are still doing well , according to some researchers . employers have tended to move toward the suburbs , away from city cores -- and away from many workers , the study says . moreover , even if you already live in the suburbs , it does n't mean you live close to the suburb where the jobs are . `` suburban residents saw the number of jobs within a typical commute distance drop by 7 % , more than twice the decline experienced by the typical city resident -lrb- 3 % -rrb- , '' elizabeth kneebone and natalie holmes wrote in the study 's summary . the issue disproportionately affects poor and minority residents , the authors added . `` residents of high-poverty and majority-minority neighborhoods experienced particularly pronounced declines in job proximity , '' they wrote , observing that 61 % of high-poverty tracts and 55 % of majority-minority neighborhoods experienced declines in job proximity between 2000 and 2012 . high-poverty neighborhoods were defined as tracts with poverty rates above 20 % . the brookings study comes as metro areas are coping with increased stresses on infrastructure . tuesday 's new york times was filled with letters complaining about a subway fare increase and crowds at all hours in the new york system . in atlanta , one suburban county recently added mass transit for the first time since 2010 -- even as the georgia legislature has been gutting portions of a transportation bill . and a detroit man garnered nationwide headlines in february because of his 21-mile commute -- a hefty chunk of which he walked due to a lack of transit options . the brookings study observes that solving commuting issues `` will require collaborative solutions '' across jurisdictions . `` the dynamics that have shaped these job proximity patterns across and within metro areas did not emerge by themselves , '' kneebone and holmes wrote -lrb- pdf -rrb- . `` local , regional , and state leaders put them in play -lrb- whether purposefully or by default -rrb- through policy decisions . to foster growth that is truly regional in its reach and that does not exacerbate inequality or leave low-income and minority residents behind , communities will need to coordinate and collaborate as they plan and implement policy decisions that affect metropolitan development patterns .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- jeb bush 's money machine expectations , al gore 's iowa trip , rand paul 's iran strategy and john boehner 's next move were all topics around the `` inside politics '' table this sunday . jeb bush is going to be doubling down on his contrast with hillary clinton on transparency , using the emails he released from his time as governor of florida -- and maybe the u.s. 's largest e-retailer . while bush has already released the first chapter of his e-book on his website , ron fournier of the national journal reports that bush is in serious negotiations with amazon for a big deal that would have the full memoir published across all its platforms , including kindle . `` he 'll use the emails to draw a narrative of his time in florida -- the highs , the lows , but also some mistakes , some errors , '' said fournier . many recent presidential candidates have written books before or during their runs for the white house , but all have to prove themselves in the race for campaign cash . one of the big early tests for presidential candidates is to prove they can raise the money for the long haul . and the first lap in the money primary winds up at the end of this month , when candidates have to report their first-quarter fund-raising totals . cnn 's john king reveals that there is a bit of an expectations game clash underway as we head into the final weeks of the quarter . team bush got a bit dismayed when several allies started talking about a record-smashing $ 100 million quarter for his `` right to rise '' political action committee . now , some bush allies are bragging that a $ 50 million figure would still be a big deal . are they trying to truly lower expectations -- or just create space for a bigger number to be a bigger deal ? we 'll know in three weeks . after hillary clinton 's email controversy , there 's been a lot of talk about who would step in if she bowed out as a potential democratic presidential candidate . one high-profile politician who 's planning his first trip to iowa in over a decade has a lot of hawkeye state democrats buzzing , according to cnn 's jeff zeleny . '' -lrb- former vice president al gore -rrb- says he 's not running . i 'm sure he 's not , but he 's doing a climate leadership workshop that 's getting everyone there sort of excited , '' said zeleny . `` by then , hillary clinton will probably already be in the race , but democrats in iowa who are hungry for a different type of politics might be signing up for these workshops may 5 through the 7th in cedar rapids . '' as the deadline nears for a nuclear policy agreement between iran and six world powers including the u.s. , all eyes will be on sen. rand paul . paul has been trying to shore up his foreign policy credentials to satisfy the more hawkish elements in the republican party , but bloomberg 's lisa lerer questions whether his attempts are working . `` this past week he signed on as a co-sponsor to legislation giving congress final say over any deal that 's struck by the administration , '' said lerer . `` it 's unlikely to be enough to satisfy parts of the republican base and also satisfy key donors for the party who are very concerned about israel . '' `` he also came under fire this past week for not applauding vociferously enough during israeli prime minister bibi netanyahu 's speech . i think a lot of eyes will be on him this month as we delve into these issues . '' as congress ' slugfest over homeland security funding ends , npr 's juana summers looks ahead to more tough fights for house speaker john boehner , including appropriations battles and the fall 's debt ceiling fight . one of the keys to the outcome of these future clashes is boehner 's plan to handle the house gop 's contentious tea party members . `` is boehner willing to continually antagonize the far right wing of his party and pass legislation with democrats ? or will he be passing bills with only republicans ? '' asks summers . `` and that , i think , will tell us a lot about what the congress will look like in the next few years to come . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for the first time ever , we 're getting a live-action `` star wars '' movie without the man who composed the `` star wars '' theme . `` star wars : rogue one , '' the recently-announced `` star wars '' spinoff movie starring felicity jones , will not include the soaring music of oscar winner john williams . williams originally scored `` star wars '' and every other episode since then , including the upcoming `` force awakens '' later this year . however , composer alexandre desplat has revealed that he will be working on 2016 's `` rogue one . '' the film 's director , gareth edwards , worked with desplat last year on `` godzilla . '' a `` star wars '' movie without that iconic williams sound is certainly something that fans will have to get used to , and desplat has a big job ahead of him . williams ' work will also be absent from the next steven spielberg movie , `` bridge of spies , '' it was announced this week . for the past three decades , williams has scored every single spielberg film , but the new movie , starring tom hanks and due out october 16 , will be scored by thomas newman , best known for the score of `` american beauty . '' movie studio dreamworks attributed williams ' absence to a `` minor health issue , since corrected . '' williams ' best known non - `` star wars '' music is almost entirely from spielberg films , including `` jaws , '' `` raiders of the lost ark , '' `` e.t. . the extra terrestrial '' and `` jurassic park . '' another upcoming spielberg movie , `` the bfg , '' will include a williams score .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in november 2002 , the world was captivated by the biggest archaeological discovery ever made relating to jesus : a 2,000 year-old ossuary -- or bone box -- bearing the tantalizing inscription in aramaic : `` james , son of joseph , brother of jesus . '' if it was true , this was the first physical evidence ever found of jesus ' existence . and yet , if this amazing ossuary was false , then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history . underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem : whether or not jesus actually had any brothers . though the debate 's origins are ancient , the answer still divides catholics and protestants . for catholics , mary , joseph and jesus are a family unit unto themselves . yet catholic theology also holds that jesus was god 's son , born of the virgin -- and that mary did not give birth to other children , divine or otherwise . ` finding jesus ' : john the baptist q&a . so who are these `` brothers '' that the gospel of mark mentions ? the rev. james martin , author of the book `` jesus : a pilgrimage , '' calls the relationship between james and jesus `` very complicated . '' `` he 's called clearly the brother of the lord , and the greek uses the common word for brother , '' martin says . but catholics also believe in mary 's perpetual virginity , so martin surmises that james and the other brothers were joseph 's children from a prior marriage . `` it makes sense that joseph would have been older and mary was younger , so i see them in a sense as stepbrothers . '' other catholic scholars see james and jesus as cousins , an idea that began in the fourth century , when st. jerome , who translated the hebrew bible and the new testament into latin , argued the point against the theologian helvedius , who said mary and joseph had other children . ` finding jesus ' : shroud of turin q&a . jerome countered that these children were instead born to mary of clopas , jesus ' aunt . jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that `` adelphios , '' the greek word used for jesus ' brothers and sisters , could refer to cousins , as well as to siblings . protestants , however , see jesus ' family as free of ambiguity , with mary and joseph having several children . one of them is jesus -- but the question then becomes , which one ? ben witherington iii , professor of new testament interpretation at asbury theological seminary , offers the protestant view that jesus and james were full brothers , with jesus being the elder . `` the new testament says nothing about mary being a perpetual virgin , it says she virginally conceived jesus , and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that , and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters , '' witherington says . is judas in hell ? jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in galilee and judea , has a ministry and leaves james and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family , according to the scholar . what 's more contentious for some protestants , is the fact that jesus , as the eldest in the family , essentially forsook his obligation as next-in-line to head the family after joseph died . instead he followed his divine destiny , as ordained by his father in heaven . 5 things you did n't know about jesus . that left james to fill the void . whatever he was -- brother , step-brother or cousin -- we know that james became important in the early christian church because of his relation to jesus . paul , the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the roman empire , says as much in his letter to the galatians : . `` then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit cephas and stayed with him 15 days ; but i did not see any other apostle except james the lord 's brother . '' james and peter and paul were the prime movers of this new faith , with james the leader of the jesus followers in jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 ce , forgiving his killers with his last breath , just as his brother jesus had done . given his importance to the early christian church , why would n't he be connected to his brother , or even stepbrother , on the burial box containing his bones ? michael mckinley is co-author , with david gibson , of `` finding jesus : faith . fact . forgery. : six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels .

boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- dun meng knew to pull over his mercedes-benz suv to respond to a text message that night in april 2013 . that 's when a man got out of another car , jumped into his suv and pointed a gun at him . `` he asked me , ` do you know the boston marathon explosion ? ' '' meng told a crowded courtroom thursday , speaking in halting english . an interpreter who spoke meng 's native mandarin sat next to him but was not needed . `` he asked , ` you know who did it ? i did it and i just killed a policeman in cambridge , ' '' meng said a man later identified as tamerlan tsarnaev told him . meng was on the witness stand in the death penalty trial of admitted boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev , tamerlan 's younger brother . he recalled seeing the flashing lights of police cars in cambridge earlier that night . `` after that , how did you feel ? '' assistant u.s. attorney william weinreb asked . `` terrified . the whole world is looking for him at the time . ... i thought it was just a typical robbery . '' there was nothing typical about the days after the boston marathon bombings , which killed three people and hurt more than 240 others . timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath . prosecutors say dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev had earlier killed massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier because they wanted his gun . but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster . dzhokhar tsarnaev , who was 19 at the time , does not dispute he was present when collier was killed on the evening of april 18 , 2013 , nor does he deny that he participated in the bombings three days earlier . he is being tried on 30 charges -- 17 of which carry the possibility of the death penalty . tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , would not survive the night . he was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an `` officer down '' at mit . it was after collier 's killing that meng encountered the tsarnaev brothers . tsarnaev 's ` manifesto ' : ok to kill civilians . at the time , he was working on his master 's degree at northeastern university . meng , a partner at a company that created a food delivery app , recalled feeling tired after work . he drove along the charles river with no destination in mind . he pulled over after receiving a text message . `` i 'm a traffic engineer , and i know it is unsafe to text while i 'm driving , '' he said . a car pulled up quickly and stopped . a man in the car walked over . meng said he thought the man wanted directions . instead , the man pulled open the suv door and climbed in . meng said tamerlan tsarnaev demanded cash . he said he had about $ 45 on him . `` he said , ` that 's not enough . where 's your wallet ? ' so i give him my wallet , but there 's no cash in the wallet . '' the man pulled the magazine out of his handgun . he showed meng it was loaded . `` i 'm serious , '' meng testified that the man told him moments before admitting to being the boston marathon bomber . `` so do n't be stupid . '' jurors see tsarnaev 's writings on boat . after he handed over the cash , meng said the man ordered him to drive . he said dzhokhar tsarnaev followed in a honda but later got in the backseat of the suv . `` he ordered me to every direction , '' he said of tamerlan tsarnaev . `` we had a conversation . ... he asked me my name and he asked me where i 'm from . first few minutes my hands were shaking and i was having trouble driving . i was very scared . '' meng said his name was manny . the man laughed when he thought meng said nanny . `` i said i 'm chinese . he said , ` ok , you are chinese . i am muslim and muslims hate americans . ' i responded , ` i 'm chinese . chinese are very friendly toward muslims . ' '' at one point , the carjacker asked meng for the pin code on his bank card . `` i tell him the pin code , '' he testified . `` it started with 86 , somebody 's birthday . he asked me if i was born in 1986 , and i said yes . '' meng testified that he asked tamerlan tsarnaev : `` are you going to kill me tonight ? he told me , ` i 'm not going to kill you . just relax , man . ' '' the witness pointed to dzhokhar tsarnaev as the man who later sat in the backseat behind him . the men played a cd as they drove around . `` i would say weird , '' he said of the music . `` it sounded religious . '' new surveillance footage revealed . at one point , dzhokhar tsarnaev went into a gas station convenience store to pay for gas and load up on snacks , meng testified . tamerlan fiddled with a gps device . meng unbuckled his seat belt , opened the suv door and got away , dashing across the street to another service station . he never looked back . meng begged a worker to call the police . he hid there until officers arrived . it was `` the most difficult decision in my life , '' he said . `` i could feel he was trying to grab me . his hand was so close to my left hand i could feel the wind . '' cambridge police officer michael nickerson had to talk meng out of a gas station storage room when he arrived . `` he was trembling , '' nickerson testified . `` he was very scared . you could tell he was a victim of something .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the beauty of afghanistan -- a country blemished by wars , upheaval and the inhumane treatment of women by extremists -- has almost been forgotten by the world , and by many afghans themselves . in the last few decades , little attention has been paid to the other afghanistan : the sweet melodies , the kind people , and the beautiful land full of ancient wisdom and intersecting traditions . this is understandable . it would be irresponsible to solely focus on those positives while families are torn apart and the noise of war rings in people 's ears . generations of afghans have had their homes surrounded by battles and their lives punctuated by fear . afghanistan has been the largest refugee-producing country for 32 years . one out of every four refugees worldwide is afghan , according to the united nations . recently , i was watching an engrossing reality tv show featuring singers when a friend peered over my shoulder and asked about the program . i explained that it was `` afghan star , '' afghanistan 's answer to `` american idol . '' she was shocked by the set and the sophisticated arena stage where the stars were standing . that stage could easily have been in new york , los angeles , london or rome . this , i realized , is the afghanistan no one believes exists , or has ever existed . afghanistan has a rich tradition of music , poetry , and songs that have influenced its neighbors and any region of the world exposed to the silk road . after all , the famous sufi poet mawlana jalalideen rumi was from modern-day afghanistan . i grew up across the river in tajikistan , hearing afghan songs and tales of the parties in kabul , and learning about afghan singers , who are beloved across the region . i started watching `` afghan star '' last year after hearing about contestant dawood pazhman from afghanistan 's remote northeastern province of badakhshan , who traveled 16 hours -lrb- sometime on foot -rrb- to kabul to audition for the show . this year , another contestant , panj shanbe maftoon , also traveled from that remote region for a chance to audition . panj shanbe told tolo tv , which produces `` afghan star , '' that he did not have enough to eat and did n't have money for his commute to kabul . but he knew , he said , that in this day and age , in his new afghanistan , he can hope , dream , and make things happen . panj shanbe 's story was so compelling , i have tuned in every week for months now to see what he will sing and whether he will be safe from elimination . he is now among the top three contestants . as i watched every show , the beacon of hope of a new afghanistan became clear to me . young men and women auditioned , speaking of peace and coexistence , supporting one another outside of tribes or ethnic lines . they wanted what my own children want -- the freedom to explore being a young adult and to follow their dreams . this is the new afghanistan -- the struggles around poverty , religion and resilience are ever-present , but hope shines through in ways that make everyday life brighter . `` afghan star '' is a source of pride , happiness and escape for many afghans . when you talk to any afghan around the world , they know all about the contestants and the judges . they openly give their opinions and feel that they are a part of the process ; anyone around the world can vote via sms and call-ins . the panel of judges acts as an amplifier for the voices of the vulnerable , bringing attention to orphans , poverty , and the plight of women . this grounded attitude is meaningful because each one of the judges is a living legend in afghanistan -- superstars who also have their own war stories to tell . the stalwart female judge , shahla zaland , comes from a family of famous composers and singers . last year told the contestants a heart-wrenching story about her father 's life abroad as a refugee and how she believes her father `` died of homesickness . '' her presence on the panel of judges is a reminder that women are strong , women do not need to be veiled , and that female contestants who audition should be championed . there is a beacon of hope in just looking at how much the show has changed in its 10 seasons . during the first season , after years of the taliban 's ban on music , a female contestant performed without a hijab , resulting in death threats . the young woman had to go into hiding . this season , for international women 's day , the show celebrated afghan women . male contestants dedicated songs and presented flowers to the women , singing of the strength of afghan mothers . a young woman performed , dancing with her hair flowing freely . the show ended with a dedication to afghani poetess nadia anjuman . anjuman studied literature in secret during the taliban occupation , becoming a well-known published poet before her husband killed her at age 25 . he found her writings inappropriate and a stain on his honor . the beautiful irony is that anjuman 's words live on in books and songs today . shahla zaland performed a song that put anjuman 's poetry to music . wearing an afghan flag around her shoulders , her hair uncovered , she brought anjuman 's words to life : . `` i am not that weak willow tree that trembles with the wind . `` i am an afghan woman and so i wail . '' with three contestants left , the show will end friday night , appropriately on nawruz , the perisan new year celebrated in afghanistan , tajikistan and iran . though panj shanbe was my initial reason for watching the show , i will be happy no matter which contestant becomes the `` afghan star . '' the reality is we are all winners because of one tv program . those living as refugees and those living abroad by choice , away from the homeland , get a taste of the music and culture of their birth country , sparking renewed belief in the new afghanistan . and people in afghanistan are given glimpses of what the new afghanistan can look like -- a vision of young men and women free from war , who can pursue their dreams .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- iraqi forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against isis . but as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of tikrit from isis insurgents , there is an important question that the united states and its allies should be asking : could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring iraq 's stability ? the reality is that short-term tactical victories wo n't be enough to defeat isis , especially as the reliance on iran-backed shiite militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local sunni population . indeed , the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the shiite militias , whose track record of sectarian violence is well-documented , and their involvement threatens to drive more iraqi sunnis into the arms of isis . gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , has said the involvement of these groups `` will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism . '' but based on past experience , many locals are understandably more frightened by their designated `` liberators '' than they are of the vicious extremists of isis who have ruled their towns over the past eight months . historically , iraq has n't always needed shiite militias under iran 's command to fight sunni extremists . al qaeda was expelled from northern iraq in 2007 , when its harsh rule antagonized tribal leaders that had supported the anti-u.s. insurgency , prompting them to make common cause with the americans in what became known as the `` awakening '' movement . unfortunately , once its goal had been achieved , baghdad rounded on the awakening , betraying promises of integration into the national army and polity and instead arresting and killing its leaders along with trusted sunni elected representatives . the united states looked the other way , deeming it a `` domestic '' political matter . that simply emboldened then-prime minister nuri al-maliki to deepen his purge of sunni elected representatives , and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many sunni leaders . this undermined the work that the united states had done in persuading iraq 's sunnis that fighting al qaeda and voting in elections was the best way to advance their communal interests . put simply , al-maliki 's actions made a mockery of any sunni confidence in the electoral system or the national government . it was the resulting sunni alienation that allowed al qaeda 's successor , isis , back into those communities . the growing fear among many sunnis has been compounded by prime minister haider al-abadi 's statement to parliament that any iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with isis -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary sunnis , many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a shiite-led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated . and isis has undoubtedly capitalized on the permissive environment created by such alienation , which persists despite the obama administration having convinced itself that al-abadi would somehow prove to be more inclusive than his predecessors from the same shiite islamist party . all this suggests that the `` awakening '' experience , which showed that iraqi sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so , is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating isis . but the outcome must be different from the last awakening . sunnis willing to fight isis should be given control over their own affairs in northern iraq in the way that kurdish aspirations have been accommodated . the alternative , of relying on sectarian forces to drive out the extremists , is more likely to ensure their return than to prevent it . getting to a new political order in iraq that offers the prospect of sustainable stability and progress will require compromise , not only among iraqis but also among the regional sponsors of its contending factions -- iraq has become a key battleground in the regional struggle between camps led by iran and the saudis . creating a political order capable of stabilizing iraq will require a new security `` grand bargain '' negotiated between the key stakeholders . short-term tactical victories wo n't defeat isis , and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal . the reality is that ultimately , only a political deal that guarantees iraqi sunnis ' inclusion , equality and protection -- one that is implemented by iran and its allied iraqi militia -- can resolve the isis problem . and unless all of the key stakeholders are willing to negotiate a new way of living together , iraq is likely to remain a battleground where the united states finds itself inadvertently reinforcing the problem .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- on friday , isis claimed responsibility for yemen 's deadliest terror attack . a day earlier it claimed responsibility for the worst terror attack in tunisia . last week it welcomed into the fold boko haram , a nigerian terrorist group with thousands of fanatical fighters that dominates territory the size of new jersey . all this came in the wake of the group 's rapid expansion across libya , its assimilation of a powerful egyptian terrorist group , and the founding of small chapters in saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan and algeria , where its new affiliate last year beheaded a french hiker . the group 's momentum may have stalled in syria and iraq , but its supporters from the atlantic to the hindu kush appear to be heeding its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's call to `` erupt volcanoes of jihad . '' by far the most surprising development was its claim of responsibility for the twin suicide bomb blasts that killed over 130 in houthi-shia mosques in sanaa , yemen , on friday and another attack in the north . isis was only thought to have a fledgling presence in yemen and had only claimed one previous attack , the assassination of a yemeni security official north of aden earlier this month . al qaeda in yemen , or aqap , has for years been the dominant jihadi group inside yemen , but it denied involvement in the mosque attacks , saying it was against its principles to target mosques , bolstering the isis claim . this indicates isis has very quickly built up an operational capability inside yemen in the months since jihadis inside the country released an audiotape declaring allegiance to baghdadi last november . only two developments could explain this : defections from aqap or the return home of yemeni isis veterans skilled in urban warfare and explosives . there is no love lost these days between the two groups . since baghdadi declared isis had expanded into yemen late last year there has been an escalating war of words between them , with isis claiming aqap was not doing enough to target houthis and aqap declaring that the isis caliphate was illegitimate . while aqap has acknowledged previous internal disagreements about whether to support isis , there have been relatively few defections . its charismatic leader , nasir al-wuhayshi , al qaeda 's global number two , is extremely popular among the group 's rank and file . in recent months the group has reaped a recruitment windfall from sunni tribal anger over the houthi takeover of sanaa , allowing it to expand its operations across yemen . but isis appears now to have laid down the gauntlet , declaring its attacks friday were the `` tip of the iceberg . '' in targeting the houthi mosques in sanaa , isis would be quite deliberately repeating the sectarian strategy of its founder , abu musab al-zarqawi , who launched a devastating suicide bombing on golden mosque in samarra in february 2006 , which plunged iraq into a full-blown sectarian civil war . al-zarqawi correctly calculated that the shia , infuriated by the attack on their most sacred shrines , would violently retaliate , driving sunnis into the embrace of the jihadis . yemen appears now to be on the brink of a similar civil war . the terrorist attack on the bardo museum in tunisia on wednesday that killed 23 was the worst terrorist attack on tourists in the arab world since the 1997 massacre in luxor , egypt . it would also be isis ' most spectacular act of international terrorism since it carried out coordinated suicide bombings on american and international hotels in amman , jordan , in 2005 . but tunisia is right on europe 's doorstep , just 30 miles across the sea from the southern italian island of pantelleria . isis has so far offered no proof to back up its claim it was responsible . yet several factors give the claim credence . firstly , as of late friday no other group had claimed responsibility . secondly , tunisian investigators have established that two members of the cell that carried out the attack trained in the derna and benghazi region of libya late last year . in november , cnn reported that isis was running several training camps in the green mountains between these two eastern libyan towns where it was instructing recruits from across north africa , including tunisians . thirdly , up to 3,000 tunisians have traveled to syria and iraq , many to fight with isis . five-hundred are believed to have returned home , including a significant number of trained killers , skilled in handling automatic weapons . the three most powerful new isis affiliates are in egypt , libya and nigeria . last november the egyptian sinai-based jihadi group ansar beit al-maqdis pledged allegiance to isis . bolstered by the return home from syria of egyptian isis veterans , in recent months the group has escalated its campaign of attacks against security forces in the sinai and across egypt and has put out its own gory beheading videos . the threat it poses to western tourists was underlined last summer when it killed an american oil worker in the deserts southwest of cairo in a carjacking . in libya , isis is taking advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand . last autumn it established a foothold in eastern libya , bolstered by the return of 300 libyan isis veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of al-baghdadi . it is now the dominant force in derna , has a presence in benghazi and controls part of the town center in sirte , on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen egyptian christians in february . it also has a growing presence in tripoli , where its fighters in january carried out an attack on the five-star corinthia hotel that killed several westerners . in nigeria , boko haram pledged allegiance to isis earlier this month and brought celebrations to the streets of raqqa , isis ' headquarters town in syria . boko haram hopes it will bring a recruitment , fundraising and propaganda windfall . `` the merger with the islamic state was a strategic , calculated , and long-term decision coming from the top of the boko haram leadership and communications structure , '' wrote jacob zenn , an expert on the group , in a just released west point combating terrorism center study on isis ' growing array of affiliates . though military operations by nigeria and chad have eroded boko haram 's safe haven in northeastern nigeria in recent weeks , the group still has formidable capacity to terrorize the region . a signature tactic : beheading its enemies with chain saws . for reasons of geography , there appear to be fewer organizational ties between isis and boko haram than between isis and its affiliates in libya and egypt . `` the numbers of boko fighters who have fought or trained with isis in places such as syria , iraq , turkey , and libya and returned to nigeria is believed to be small : fewer than 20 fighters and video-propagandists , '' zenn , who was recently briefed by nigerian intelligence officials , told cnn . isis ' expansion into the southern shore of the mediterranean has alarmed european governments . italian fishermen operating off the south coast of italy are so concerned they could be targeted by isis gunmen launching from libya in speedboats that they have demanded protection from the italian navy . then there is the threat of trained european fighters returning home from the killing fields of iraq and syria . over 3,000 europeans have traveled to fight in syria and iraq , many with isis . more than 750 have returned . among their number , according to belgian counterterrorism officials , was a belgian terrorist cell dispatched by isis from syria to carry out a major terrorist attack in the heart of europe . the plot was thwarted when several of the cell were killed in a gunbattle in eastern belgium in january . european officials told cnn isis is increasingly pivoting toward plotting attacks in europe . there is also concern isis could infiltrate non-european union passport holders into europe . last year more than a hundred-thousand refugees arrived in italy from libya , according to the united nations . french prime minister manuel valls warned thursday that europe faced the greatest terrorist threat in its history , the starkest warning yet from a head of a european government since isis set up its caliphate in syria and iraq . `` the problem is not if there will be another attempted attack in france and in europe , but to know when and where , '' he said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the first state visit to the united states of afghan president ashraf ghani and chief executive officer abdullah abdullah was supposed to take place in early march . but the visit was delayed because republican leaders had invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to address congress during the same time period . according to two afghan government officials involved in the planning for the visit , the afghan government believed american media attention would be largely focused on netanyahu , so the first u.s. visit of the new afghan president was delayed by two weeks , which is a useful reminder that there is a sound reason why congressional leaders should n't unilaterally extend invitations to foreign leaders . ghani and abdullah arrived in washington on sunday and have had much to discuss with the obama administration . for the afghan government , the timetable of president barack obama 's proposed troop withdrawal is the key issue . obama says that the last american troops will leave afghanistan at the end of 2016 . this happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down america 's post-9 / 11 wars . ghani is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this u.s. troop withdrawal , telling cbs ' `` 60 minutes '' in january , `` deadlines should not be dogmas '' and that there should be a `` willingness to reexamine '' the withdrawal date . is obama 's withdrawal plan a wise policy ? short answer : of course not . one only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in iraq after the withdrawal of u.s. troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an afghanistan without some kind of residual american presence . without american forces in the country , there is a strong possibility afghanistan could host a reinvigorated taliban allied to a reinvigorated al qaeda , not to mention isis , which is gaining a foothold in the region . needless to say , this would be a disaster for afghanistan . but it would also be quite damaging to u.s. interests to have some kind of resurgent al qaeda in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks . it would also be disastrous for the democratic party , should it win the presidency in 2016 , to be the party that `` lost '' afghanistan . after all , the democratic party is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the republicans and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual american presence in afghanistan , al qaeda would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the afghan-pakistan border region against american interests somewhere in the world . on tuesday , president obama announced that the withdrawal of u.s. forces from afghanistan would be slowed and the remaining 9,800 troops would stay there through the end of 2015 . but this welcome development does not change the central issue , which is the obama administration 's withdrawal date of december 2016 for all u.s. forces . merely because the obama administration will be almost out the door at the end of 2016 does n't mean that suddenly at the same time that the taliban will lay down their arms , nor that the afghan army will be able to fight the taliban completely unaided . nor does it mean that al qaeda -- and isis , which is beginning to establish small cells in afghanistan -- would cease to be a threat . an easy way for potential democratic presidential candidates such as hillary clinton to distinguish their national security policies from obama 's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long-term u.s. military presence in afghanistan and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an iraq-style outcome . similarly , as the republican party starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign , potential candidates such as jeb bush can distinguish themselves from the isolationist rand paul wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long-term presence in afghanistan . this u.s. military presence in afghanistan does n't have to be a large , nor does it need to play a combat role , but u.s. troops should remain in afghanistan to advise the afghan army and provide intelligence support . such a long-term commitment of several thousand american troops is exactly the kind of force that the obama administration was forced to deploy to iraq following isis 's lightning advances there over the past year . selling a longer-term u.s. military presence in afghanistan would be pushing against an open door with that nation 's government . consider that within 24 hours of being installed , the new afghan government led by ghani and abdullah signed the basing agreement that allows american troops to stay in afghanistan until december 2016 . consider also that the afghan government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the united states lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term u.s. military presence . consider also that many afghans see a relatively small , but long-term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability . it is also not in pakistan 's interests for afghanistan to fall to the taliban or be thrust into another civil war . the pakistanis have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the taliban to flourish on their own soil , most recently in the taliban attack in december on the army school in peshawar that killed 132 children . it is in pakistan 's own interest that the afghan army is able to fight effectively against the taliban , which is more likely if they continue to have american advisers at their side . other regional powers such as the chinese worry about chinese uighur separatists establishing themselves on afghan soil . the russians are similarly worried about islamist terrorist groups located in afghanistan and so will not stand in the way of a small long-term u.s. military presence in afghanistan as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country . keeping a relatively small , predominantly u.s. special forces , presence in afghanistan to continue to train the afghan army past december 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both afghans and americans . both the democratic and republican parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign . and obama should do his successor a favor by leaving this important decision up to the next president .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the terrorists who attacked the bardo museum in tunis , tunisia , last week were wearing suicide vests but failed to detonate them before being gunned down by police , tunisia 's president told cnn . `` they had them , but they did n't work , because the police turned up and they were shot down and they did n't have the time to get these vests to work . because had they done so , we would have had major catastrophe , '' president beji caid essebsi told cnn 's christiane amanpour . a third museum attacker remains at large , essebsi said . previously two suspects had been identified -- yassine labidi and saber khachnaou -- though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces . essebsi told amanpour 15 arrests had been made since wednesday 's attack , in which 23 people were killed . most of the victims were foreigners and 19 were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis . essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of isis who had been trained in libya . this echoed comments made by tunisia 's security minister rafik chelly on friday , who said two attackers had been given weapons training at libyan camps and had been activated from sleeper cells . in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for the attack . the message said the group had targeted `` crusaders and apostates '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades '' in bloodshed that was `` just the start . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . an uncle of suspect yassine labidi , abeld malik labidi , told cnn on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew . he said yassine labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum . `` it 's true that yassine carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , '' he said . but , he said , he believed yassine and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like syria and libya to train as fighters . laura smith-spark and claudia morales contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- once again , the lure of isis may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time , medical students suspected of traveling to syria to work in isis-controlled hospitals . the group of 11 people includes seven britons , an american , a canadian and two sudanese , turkish lawmaker mehmet ali ediboglu told cnn on sunday . ediboglu , an opposition lawmaker , told the observer that he had spoken with the students ' families , who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for isis , and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring syria . `` they have been cheated , brainwashed . that is what i , and their relatives , think , '' ediboglu said , according to the newspaper . but he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle . `` let 's not forget about the fact that they are doctors , '' he told the observer . `` they went there to help , not to fight . '' in a joint statement , the students ' and doctors ' families said their children are humanitarians who went `` to turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on turkey 's borders . '' they have since `` disappeared , '' the statement said . `` we have heard from the british , turkish and sudanese authorities that we have so far met , but we hope that the respectable governments of these countries would enforce , speed up and coordinate more effective measures to ensure the safety of our children wherever they are and bring them back to us as soon as possible , '' the statement said . eight of the group are medical students who 've just graduated , and the three others are in their final year of medical school , he said . they 'd been studying in khartoum , sudan . at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the turkey-syria border , pleading for their return , according to the observer . in an interview published monday in turkey 's hürriyet daily news , the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave turkey without their children . dr. maumoon abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter , lena , who is one of the students . `` i know you want to help people and be of use . but you can do this in another way , '' he told the newspaper . `` there are many who need your help . but this is not the way . please , come back . '' british officials said they are aware of the report . `` we are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts , '' the british foreign & commonwealth office said in a statement . officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join isis ' ranks . estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by . last year , a 19-year-old colorado woman was arrested at denver international airport as she was about to start a journey to an isis camp , where she hoped to be a nurse . cnn 's jomana karadsheh , nimet kirac and radina gigova contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- my name is mark goodacre , and i am a professor of new testament and christian origins in the department of religious studies at duke university . i was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on cnn 's `` finding jesus , '' which airs on sundays . i also appear in each episode of the program . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page during the latest episode , `` the gospel of judas . '' below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them . they have been edited for style and clarity for this article : . yalanda m. price : what do scholars know about the man named judas ? what is his story ? mark goodacre : judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the new testament . in fact , the relative lack of information about him in the gospels has provided the invitation , across the centuries , for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand jesus over to the authorities . we know very little about his back story from the gospels . he appears in the list of 12 disciples called by jesus , but does not become a main character in the drama until the passion narratives . in john 's gospel , he is the disciple who is concerned about mary wasting money anointing jesus -lrb- john 12.4-6 -rrb- . soon afterward , he is arranging to hand jesus over to the authorities . his story ends with his dramatic suicide -lrb- matthew 27.3-10 -rrb- , and luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died -lrb- acts 1.18-19 -rrb- . mark goodacre answers your questions about the shroud of turin . kristine spillman adams : my understanding was always that judas betrayed jesus not because he was a villain , but he thought jesus would start an earthly war when arrested . he was trying to get jesus to establish a literal , physical kingdom on earth . goodacre : this is one of the great mysteries of the last week of jesus ' life . what motivated judas to betray jesus ? john hints that it was financial greed -lrb- john 12.6 -rrb- , and matthew says that he betrayed jesus for `` thirty pieces of silver '' -lrb- matthew 27.14-15 -rrb- . it is true , though , that many have speculated that judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter , and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction . with this theory , he was trying to force jesus ' hand . it has sometimes been said that perhaps the word `` iscariot '' is a corruption of the word `` sicarii , '' which means `` dagger bearer , '' and that would provide some backing to that theory . however , john identifies judas as `` son of simon iscariot '' , which makes the `` sicarii '' theory less likely . in the end , we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about judas ' motivation . candida moss answers your questions about john the baptist . betsy wilson-roark : are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate ? are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous ? goodacre : that 's a good question . well , we probably have as much of the gospel of judas as we will ever have . several additional fragments of the codex tchacos , in which the gospel of judas is featured , came to light after bruce ferrini , the dealer who owned the codex for some time , went bankrupt . now , it is estimated that we have something like 90 % to 95 % of the text . with regards to translation and interpretation , this process will continue for years to come , as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts . i think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job , all the more so as they were working with an incomplete , damaged and very complex coptic text that had been lost for centuries . but i also greatly admire april deconick 's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the gospel that this has brought about . i was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the gospel of judas dramatized so effectively in `` finding jesus . '' amarylis didley west : is there a place that we can find and read the gospel of judas ? goodacre : the national geographic website on the gospel of judas does feature the original translation from 2006 . as far as i am aware , there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation . watch the latest episode anytime on cnngo . nj robinson : good question would be did jesus know judas would betray him when/before he chose him ? goodacre : the gospel writers themselves single out judas as the one who would betray jesus -lrb- more accurately `` hand him over '' -rrb- as soon as they introduce him -lrb- e.g. mark 3.19 -rrb- , but they , of course , are writing with the benefit of hindsight . we can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical jesus . our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction . if you would like to read more about judas , a good starting point is provided in this article on the society of biblical literature 's bible odyssey website . it is written by `` finding jesus '' contributor bruce chilton . and if you would like to read more about the gospel of judas , `` finding jesus '' contributor april deconick discusses it on bible odyssey . is judas in hell ?
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the a320 , the aircraft involved in a crash in france on tuesday , has for several decades been a key component in the rivalry between manufacturers airbus and boeing . the twin-engined a320 entered service in 1988 , some two decades after its single-aisle rival , boeing 's 737 . as of march 2015 , there have been a total of 11,537 orders for the a320 , with 6,452 deliveries to date and slightly fewer aircraft flying globally by more than 300 operators . airbus says the entire fleet has accumulated 150 million flight hours in more than 85 million flights . the a320 family ranges from the smaller a318 -lrb- about 100 seats -rrb- , to the upgraded a321 -lrb- about 185 to 220 passengers depending on the class configuration -rrb- . the short to medium-range a320 is the most popular version with a range of about 3,300 nautical miles or 6,150 kilometers . it has a wingspan of 35.8 meters -lrb- with wing fins called sharklets -rrb- , a length of 37.57 meters and a maximum payload of 16.6 tonnes , according to airbus . the aircraft -- flight 9525 -- involved in tuesday 's crash was operated by germanwings , a subsidiary of german flag carrier lufthansa . airbus said the 150-seat aircraft , which had been flying between barcelona , spain and dusseldorf , germany , was 24 years old , having been delivered to lufthansa from its production line in 1991 . it said the a320 had accumulated approximately 58,300 flight hours in 46,700 flights . it was powered by cfm 56-5a1 turbofan engines , the latest versions of which are capable of delivering up to 33,000 pounds of thrust . the aircraft manufacturer said it was sending a `` go-team of technical advisers '' to assist french authorities at the scene of the crash . germanwings ' fleet includes 15 active a320s , according to another database , planespotters.net . the a320-200 can seat up to 180 passengers in a single-class configuration . the germanwings plane was carrying 150 people , including six crew members . according to information from the aviation safety network accident database , there have been 55 incidents involving the a320 , not including tuesday 's crash . in december 2014 , an airbus a320 operated by airasia indonesia crashed into the java sea en route from surabaya , indonesia to singapore . all 162 people on board flight qz8501 were killed . `` the a320 has a fantastic safety record , '' said phil seymour , the president of the international bureau of aviation . `` there have been a couple of incidents , but generally speaking , they 're safer than most aircraft out there now . '' seymour adds that at 24 years old , the aircraft involved in the crash was probably nearing the final years of its working life , but that would not affect safety . `` airlines would usually consider retiring an aircraft at the 25-30 years point because maintenance costs increase beyond that . `` these things fly day-in and day-out and are designed to go on and on . airlines usually only decide to retire them because maybe there 's a younger aircraft that does n't use as much fuel and does n't cost so much to run .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders , authorities said . the suspect , richard white , 63 , died saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff 's lieutenant fired at him to halt the friday night attack , the jefferson parish sheriff 's office said . sheriff newell normand said earlier that investigators had n't been able to talk to white , who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness . he said white 's wife and children had been very cooperative . louis armstrong new orleans international airport was back open and fully operational , mayor mitch landrieu said . he praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack . the incident began when white , carrying a bag , entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for concourse b and began spraying transportation security administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray , the sheriff 's office said . he then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area . `` what i saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray , '' said tsa agent carol richel , whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at white . the officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at white to slow him down , but the suspect still barged through , richel told reporters . richel , who was not armed , yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff 's lieutenant , who she knew had a weapon . `` i was calling , ` run , run ' for them to get away from him , and i was calling for the -lrb- lieutenant -rrb- so she was there and alert , '' richel said . `` i did n't hear him say anything , '' she said . `` once i yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared , i looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me . and i ran as fast as i could and thank god the officer was as close as she was , because i would n't be here today . '' she said the man came `` within inches '' of whacking her with the machete . `` this man was swinging very hard , very hard with that machete , '' richel said . `` and if he would have made contact with anybody , it would have been terrible . '' normand said lt. heather slyve fired three shots , ultimately stopping the attacker . he said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through richel 's upper right arm . richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep . `` originally , i thought the machete hit me . i did n't realize it was a bullet , '' she said . `` i knew he was close , so i honestly thought he hit me and she shot him . '' when white approached the checkpoint , he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him , normand said . `` what the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a molotov cocktail , '' normand said . a grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag , and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks , which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs . `` the fact that he ended up dropping the bag -lrb- when -rrb- the tsa agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event , '' normand said . `` had he been able to hold onto the bag , he might not have continued to chase the tsa agents through the checkpoint . he might have gone somewhere else . '' the bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car , and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for freon , one for oxygen and one for acetylene , a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting . normand said their intended purpose was n't clear . normand said `` there is a mental illness component '' in their investigation of the suspect . `` no one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior , '' normand said . `` and not unlike dealing with the mentally ill , sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior . '' people who had recently interacted with white described him as very cordial , calm , cool and collected , normand said . they reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary . it was n't clear why white was at the airport . contrary to earlier reports , normand said saturday , white was no longer a taxi driver . cnn 's janet digiacomo , joe sutton , tony marco and greg botelho contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- three teen british girls suspected of traveling to syria to join isis appeared on surveillance video in turkey before they went to their destination . images show the teens boarding a bus in istanbul , turkish hbr television reported . it 's the first sighting of the girls since they left london almost two weeks ago . authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in turkey and believe they have crossed into neighboring syria , parts of which have been taken over by islamist terror group isis . the three east london classmates -- shamima begum , 15 ; kadiza sultana , 16 ; and amira abase , 15 -- boarded a turkish airlines plane from london 's gatwick airport to istanbul on february 17 . a british counterterrorism officer said police had tried to reach out to the girls using the turkish media and social media to persuade them to return home . the girls ' parents have also publicly begged for them to come home . days before they left for turkey , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , aqsa mahmood , who left her home in scotland to travel to syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media . an attorney for the mahmood family said the family was `` surprised , horrified '' that the contact had not prompted police action `` because they understood that aqsa 's social media content was being closely monitored by the security services . '' `` and the real concern that arises is that if a known member of isis who 's now a poster girl for isis , seen to be recruiting and spreading propaganda , is in touch with young people in our country -- that one would expect the courtesy of a knock on the door of these families , to advise them that their children may be on the cusp of radicalization or going off to syria , '' aamer anwar said . the mahmood family condemned their daughter 's actions , describing them `` as a perverted and evil distortion '' of islam . but they also said the uk security services `` have serious questions to answer '' over their failure to intervene after one or more of the missing girls got in touch with her . turkey has become the most traveled route for volunteers trying to join syria 's many armed factions since an anti-government uprising erupted more than three years ago . initially , ankara maintained an `` open door policy , '' allowing hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees to flee to safety in turkey . turkish border guards looked the other way , taking few steps to stop activists , volunteers and journalists from crossing into syria . but with the rise of the ultra-violent islamist group isis in syria , the turkish government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through turkey to get into syria . some critics have accused ankara of actively supporting isis against rival kurdish rebel groups , charges the turkish government has angrily denied . last year , the turkish government showed cnn new barricades , thermal cameras and fences aimed at better fortifying the border . historically , the turkish-syrian border , which runs more than 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- , has been notoriously difficult for turkish security forces to control . before the syrian civil war , both smugglers and kurdish separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries . turkish government officials have bristled in response to accusations that they are not stemming the flow of foreign fighters joining isis . millions of tourists visit turkey every year , where visas can be obtained upon arrival for citizens of many countries .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states and great britain have pulled their last forces out of strife-torn yemen , raising fears that the failed state will become even more of a breeding ground for terror groups plaguing the middle east and the west . over the weekend , the united states evacuated the last of its special operations forces -- including navy seals and army delta force troops -- amid the deteriorating security situation in the country , the u.s. state department said . on monday , a security source in the region familiar with the situation in yemen told cnn 's nic robertson that british special forces had also left yemen in the last few days . the british ministry of defence declined to comment . the u.s. move came a day after terrorists bombed two mosques in the capital , sanaa , on friday , killing at least 137 and wounding 357 others , according to yemen 's state-run saba news agency . the terror group isis , based in syria , claimed responsibility for the attack . it also followed months of fighting between government forces and houthi rebels , who on sunday seized the international airport in taiz . the rebels now control both the airport and sanaa . yemen has been a key u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , allowing u.s. drones and special operations forces to stalk terrorists in the country . now , that arrangement is in tatters , along with any semblance of peace in the middle eastern nation . while state department spokesman jeff rathke said saturday that the united states would continue to `` take action to disrupt continuing , imminent threats to the united states and our citizens , '' the move left some wondering what role the u.s. could play with no forces on the ground . the country closed its embassy in sanaa last month . `` i do n't think there is an active role for the u.s. other than intelligence and trying to see where the dust is going to settle , '' said u.s. sen. angus king , a maine independent who serves on the senate armed services and intelligence committees . that raises the possibility of the already unstable country becoming an even more fertile environment for terror groups to collaborate , grow and export violence , according to robin wright , a security and defense analyst with the woodrow wilson center . `` it 's becoming much like syria , much like afghanistan was at the peak of its instability , '' she said . on sunday , u.n. officials said the country appeared to be on a `` rapid downward spiral . '' the security council again deplored the violence and called for an end to the fighting and for houthi rebels to return government facilities to the elected government of president abdo rabbo mansour hadi . but officials said recent events `` seemed to be leading the country further away from a peaceful settlement and towards the edge of civil war . '' in addition to counterterrorism issues , all sorts of geopolitical influences are at work in yemen -- chief among them the regional power play between regional rivals iran and saudi arabia . the houthi rebels are shiites with ties to iran , who have long felt marginalized in majority sunni yemen . sunni arab countries in the gulf cooperation council want to limit the influence of iran , particularly saudi arabia , said cnn military analyst lt. col. rick francona . `` they believe now that iran is in control in beirut , in damascus , in baghdad and now on their southern border in yemen , '' francona said . `` so the saudis are beginning to feel a little threatened here and are hoping the yemen situation does n't spiral out of control . '' the saudis and other gulf arab nations have called for every effort to be made to roll back the houthi gains and hand full control back to hadi 's government . on monday , houthi leader abdul malik al-houthi criticized regional governments over their stance on the fighting . al-houthi said his group was striking back at al qaeda and isis in self defense , and said he found it `` very strange '' that nearby governments would condemn the group for such acts while welcoming the united states , which he called `` the umbrella of tyranny in the world . '' yemen : what you need to know about how we got here . there 's little reason to believe the security council 's calls for peace will have much impact . last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest , with little effect on the fighting . last week , a yemeni jet commanded by the houthi fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden . no one was injured , but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides . that same day , yemeni military forces -- some under the houthis , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes , aden gov. abdul aziz hobtour said . the fighting is taking a huge toll on yemen 's people and economy , said rafat al akhali , the country 's former youth minister . aside from the direct impact of fighting , people are losing jobs and businesses are closing , he said . there 's still time , he said , to implement a political solution to the crisis . `` i do n't think we 're past the point of no return yet , '' he said . francona was less sanguine . `` i do n't see anything stopping a major war going on , '' he said . cnn 's hakim almasmari , catherine e. shoichet , richard roth and stephanie halasz contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the past eight months , isis has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe . indicative of this was the announcement on saturday that the nigerian terrorist group boko haram had pledged its `` allegiance to the caliph of the muslims , '' isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi . the global spread of isis raises key questions about whether these new affiliates signal an intensification of the threat of terror . it also has important implications for the debate in congress over obama 's request for a new authorization to fight isis . lt. col. michael waltz , a u.s. special forces reserve officer who has just returned to the states after advising the nigerian ministry of defence in its fight against boko haram , told me , `` so far the pledge -lrb- to isis -rrb- seems to be legit . '' waltz says there is some debate about the timing of the pledge , because boko haram has recently come under effective attacks by nigerian forces allied with the armies of neighboring african countries that are also threatened by the group : `` some folks in the region are saying it 's a sign of desperation , as the regional offensive by nigeria and its neighbors has knocked boko haram on its heels and out of a number of its sanctuaries . the chadians have been particularly effective . '' but waltz also says there is some evidence that the boko haram pledge to isis `` has been in the works for some time . '' the group 's increasing alignment with isis is demonstrated by boko haram 's recent beheadings of its victims and its more professionally edited video releases of recent weeks that have mimicked isis ' slick videos . virginia comolli , whose book `` boko haram : nigeria 's islamist insurgency , '' will be published next month , agrees that the more sophisticated boko haram media releases of the past couple of months point to `` some sort of inspiration '' that boko haram is drawing from isis and that recent beheadings `` might also be a form of copycat but , i shall note , they are not completely new '' for boko haram . comolli also emphasized to me , `` lately the government had been able to take back a number of towns under boko haram control . boko haram has always been very resilient and adaptable , changing and upping its game when needed . the pledge might be exactly that : boko haram has recently suffered some serious blows and feels it needs to try something different to strengthen its position . '' some 5,000 have died in boko-related violence during the past half-decade , while more than 1.5 million have been forced out of their homes , but boko has generally not attacked western targets . its affiliation with isis could change that although , for the moment , it 's not clear how the boko-isis alliance would work from an operational standpoint . hilary matfess , a researcher at the nigeria social violence project at the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies , told me , `` boko haram would be the largest group to pledge allegiance to isis , but it 's not certain what kinds of logistical or operational support that isis could provide an african affiliate . '' since august , boko haram is one of some 30 terrorist groups that have issued statements of support for isis or have gone further and pledged their allegiance to isis , according to intelcenter , a virginia-based company that tracks terrorist organizations . of most concern are the groups that have pledged allegiance to isis , since this allows isis some measure of command and control over these organizations and also means that these groups will likely more closely align with isis ' goal of creating a caliphate across the muslim world as soon as feasible and use the most reprehensible of tactics to do so . in addition to boko haram , terrorist groups in afghanistan , algeria , egypt , lebanon , libya , india , indonesia , pakistan , the philippines and yemen have pledged allegiance to isis , according to intelcenter . what could this mean for the wider jihadist terrorist movement ? it 's worth taking a closer look at how the libyan branch of isis , which affiliated with it in november , has played out on the ground in libya . a senior u.s. government official told me that there is some debate in the u.s. intelligence community about whether isis ' libyan affiliate is more of a `` wannabe '' isis , and a `` rebranding '' of a local group that wanted to take advantage of isis ' fearsome brand , than a group that takes orders from isis central command in syria and iraq . on january 27 , isis gunmen attacked the corinthian hotel in the libyan capital , tripoli , killing 10 . five of the victims were foreigners and one was an american . and last month isis released a video showing members of egypt 's coptic christian minority being beheaded on a libyan beach , apparently by members of isis ' libyan affiliate . the video showed the victims in the orange jumpsuits that isis forces its victims to wear . both the attack on the corinthian hotel and the beheading of the christians do suggest some measure of command and control by isis ' core of its libyan affiliate , according to the u.s. government official , who says libyan fighters frequently go back and forth between libya and syria and iraq . the increasing globalization of isis raises some interesting questions for the obama administration and for congress . last month obama put forward a proposal for a new authorization for the use of military force specifically targeting isis . obama 's aumf proposal mentions combating isis in its heartland of syria and iraq , but it does n't mention the dozen other countries where isis now has a presence or foothold . interventionist republicans will likely want to see an aumf that specifically targets other groups allied to isis that are outside of syria and iraq . many democrats will be uncomfortable about such an expansion . the ball is now in congress ' court to decide how geographically wide the scope of the fight against isis should be . it will be an interesting debate : on one side , those who want to prolong indefinitely what is already america 's longest war , against jihadist terrorist groups like isis that have affiliates from algeria to afghanistan ; and , on the other , those who want to circumscribe that war both in time and in space . given the fact that a broadly written aumf that was passed in the days after 9/11 has allowed the united states to conduct military operations in half a dozen muslim countries over the course of the past 14 years , a new authorization that specifies both a sunset provision and also a specific geographic scope would be a useful check on executive power . and such an authorization could be amended if a substantial new threat from an isis affiliate emerges .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- latest developments : . • transponder data shows that the autopilot on germanwings flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane 's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet , according to flightradar24 , a website that tracks aviation data . • police searched germanwings flight 9525 co-pilot andreas lubitz 's apartment in dusseldorf , germany , on thursday , the city 's police spokesman said in televised comments . a team of five investigators went `` through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down , '' police spokesman markus niesczery said . full story : . the co-pilot of germanwings flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the french alps , killing all 150 people on board , officials said thursday . `` we at lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot , '' said carsten spohr , ceo of lufthansa , which owns germanwings . marseille prosecutor brice robin said the co-pilot , 27-year-old german national andreas lubitz , apparently `` wanted to destroy the aircraft . '' it 's unknown whether lubitz planned his actions , robin said . but he `` took advantage '' of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and `` activated the descent , '' which can only be done deliberately . new details released thursday appeared to support the startling revelation that someone set the plane on a crash course . transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane 's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet , according to flightradar24 , a website that tracks aviation data . the plane 's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds . the captain , somehow locked out of the cockpit , can be heard banging on the door , robin said . and screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight . for those on board when the plane plunged into the mountains , robin said , death was instantaneous . who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ? police searched lubitz 's apartment in dusseldorf on thursday , looking for clues about his possible motive . a search is underway for the plane 's second `` black box , '' the flight data recorder , which could shed more light on the plane 's final minutes . and the french government has asked the fbi to help investigate the crash , a law enforcement official said . investigators so far say they 're baffled about why lubitz would have crashed the plane . lufthansa does `` not have any clues , '' spohr said . the picture of the plane 's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder . the pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight , robin said . when the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom , he asked lubitz to take over . it 's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned , or whether lubitz `` put the lever on lock , '' which would have prevented the code from working , spohr said . the most plausible explanation of what happened next is that lubitz , `` through deliberate abstention , refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot , and used the button '' to cause the plane to lose altitude , robin said . the disaster is not being described as a `` terrorist attack , '' and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a `` suicide '' either , robin said . spohr agreed : `` if a person kills himself and also 149 other people , another word should be used -- not suicide , '' he said . lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list , and his religion was not immediately known , robin said . 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing . he had been with germanwings since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the company said . lubitz had trained at the lufthansa flight center in bremen , germany . he only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying , but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone , the prosecutor said . he had passed medical tests , spohr said . the audio recording showed his breathing to be steady , with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue . lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired , spohr said . the company considers an applicant 's psychological state when hiring , he said . the co-pilot was `` fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own , '' robin said . a man in montabaur , germany , who belonged to the same flight club as lubitz , said he could n't believe it . `` the way i know andreas , this is inconceivable , '' peter ruecker said . an 8-minute descent to death . relatives and friends of the victims traveled on special lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished . seyne-les-alpes , a nearby town , is serving as a staging post . mayor francis hermitte predicted that 200 to 300 people would come to the area thursday . most are not expected to stay overnight , he said . but in case they do , he said , local residents have offered accommodations for them . lufthansa is providing `` financial support '' to relatives of the victims , spohr said . he declined to go into details . the families of the two pilots are also in france , robin said , but they are not in the same place as the passengers ' relatives . the bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all dna identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks , he said . while some human remains have been recovered , many have not . the task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather . workers were dropped by helicopters and tied together for safety . mother , daughter among 3 american victims . the doomed flight was traveling from barcelona , spain , to dusseldorf , germany , when it crashed tuesday . germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for about eight minutes . the plane lost contact with french radar at a height of about 6,000 feet . then it crashed . the 144 passengers and six crew members came from 18 countries . about half were from germany , and 35 were from spain . students , singers among victims . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , ashley fantz , richard allen greene , jason hanna , greg botelho , frederik pleitgen , nic robertson , pierre meilhan , richard quest , hala gorani , stephanie halasz , khushbu shah , bharati naik , ingrid formanek , sandrine amiel and erin mclaughlin contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- in a side room at the american university of nigeria , four girls chat and giggle . one teenage girl in particular catches our attention . she looks familiar . then we realize why . we met her just a few weeks after boko haram had attacked her school and abducted almost 300 students . as the boko haram trucks carrying them began to speed away to the militants ' territory , she and her friend bravely jumped , barely escaping with their lives . she was one of the lucky ones . school , she says , from that day on became a reminder of what almost happened . a place she never wanted to return . but now she is back and the change in her is remarkable . she dreams of remaining in the classroom as a teacher , so that just like her tutors , she can influence and inspire young minds . studying with her here are 21 other girls from chibok . they , too , escaped boko haram . like hundreds of others across nigeria 's north east , they were targeted simply for going to school . choosing to go back to class is a statement of their courage and focus on education , which they hope will bring change back home . `` my people need my support , '' one girl says . `` and me going to school will make that change , '' she wants to be a surgeon . in a part of the world often lacking the most basic health care infrastructure , she has chosen to bring value to her community . one of three students we spoke to who want to study medicine , she 's extraordinarily focused and firm in her responses . it is hard to imagine sitting with her now what she and the other girls have been through at boko haram 's hands , what they almost lost . some questions , though , they ca n't answer : any questions about the night of the attack , any reference to the friends still missing . these are too hard . enrolled on scholarships at the university , these girls are the lucky ones , and they know it . there are 46 other chibok girls who also escaped boko haram , but there are no funds available to pay for their education . dr. margee ensign , the school 's vice-chancellor , is hoping to change that by raising funds through the university 's foundation . `` the world paid , and rightly so , a lot of attention to the close to 300 that were kidnapped , '' she says . `` we heard through various people that some had escaped that night and when it came to our attention that about a dozen wanted to come to aun , we thought , we can do that ! '' she did more then just raise the funds . when the parents agreed to release their girls into her care , she and her security director traveled -- just the two of them -- to the outskirts of chibok to go and get the girls , in spite of the insecurity . even on campus , though , the specter of boko haram is never far away . the american university is in adamawa state , one of the states in north east nigeria that is under a state of emergency . this calls for constant vigilance at the school : cars are searched by hand and guards and sniffer dogs are on constant patrol . for the girls , to remain in school , they must draw upon all their reserves of courage . it is a reality these extraordinarily self-possessed young ladies softly acknowledge . when i ask how it is they are able to persevere , one girl says with a slight smile , `` i 'm very brave and determined . '' she really is . all the girls are . but they 're hoping a day will come when they wo n't have to be .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- rubén garcía villalpando was supposed to arrive home from work on a friday evening in february . but he never again pulled into the driveway of the home in suburban dallas where he lived with his wife and four children . the 31-year-old welder died that night after a police officer shot him twice in the chest . villalpando was unarmed , but in early reports about the shooting , police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer 's commands during a traffic stop . it was n't until hours after the shooting that his wife says she got a call from police , telling her what had happened . now , questions swirl through marta romero 's mind . how will their children grow up without a father ? will authorities take the case seriously or toss it aside because of her husband 's immigration status and the fact that the man who opened fire was a police officer , not a civilian ? and what happened that night to make something so horrible happen ? `` if my husband had killed a police officer , he would be in jail , '' she said . `` but since it was the opposite , will they just leave it this way ? because an officer killed a man , because he killed an illegal and nothing more ? what are a human 's rights then ? now an animal gets more rights than a man . '' villalpando is one of three mexican nationals killed in u.s. police shootings in the past month , sparking sharp criticism from mexico 's foreign ministry and a call for the u.s. justice department to investigate . pressure for authorities to take a deeper look at the controversial case is also coming from north of the border . at a city council meeting in grapevine , texas , last week , romero and her children were among a group holding signs that said `` justice for ruben '' and chanting , `` hands up ! do n't shoot ! '' -- the phrase that started as a call to action after the shooting death of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and has now become a rallying cry across the country in protests against police violence . police said it 's too soon to say exactly what happened that night . investigators have interviewed dozens of witnesses and plan to share their findings with prosecutors . no charges have been filed . `` i do not know now whether to believe in the authorities here or not , '' romero said , `` because if a police officer acted like this , what can another official do ? i do n't know . i want to trust them , because they are the ones who are taking care of us in this city . but i do n't know what they can do . '' the case already has one piece of evidence that was n't available to investigators looking into brown 's death : a police cruiser dash cam video . but police have n't released it to the public . `` there will be more information released as the investigation continues . this additional information may shed more light on mr. villalpando 's actions that night , '' police and city officials in grapevine said last week . `` we look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident , which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident . '' villalpando 's family members said they 've seen the video , and even though it does n't show the shooting , they said it 's clear there was no good reason for the officer to open fire . villalpando was unarmed , they said , had his hands in the air and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him . it all started , police say , when a burglar alarm went off february 20 at a business in grapevine . officer robert clark of the grapevine police department spotted villalpando 's car in the area and started to follow him . soon , according to police , the pursuit turned into a high-speed chase , with the officer following villalpando from grapevine into the neighboring town of euless , texas . a grapevine police statement released after the shooting said the dash cam video shows villalpando 's car `` weaving through and around the heavy traffic and driving onto the highway attempting to evade officer clark . '' eventually , villalpando pulled over . his family said they believe he did n't stop for police right away because he was scared . he was an undocumented immigrant who had lived in the united states for 15 years and he knew any encounter with police could end with him getting deported and separated from his children , romero said . u.s. president barack obama 's announcement last fall that undocumented immigrant parents of u.s. citizen children could be eligible for work permits as part of a new executive action gave them hope , but also made them even more nervous about making sure they steered clear of trouble until the paperwork came through , she said . `` he was nervous . he knew that to have problems with the authorities was serious . ... we could n't have a criminal record , '' she said . `` that is what he had in mind . what is going to happen to me now ? now i am not going to be ok . they are going to deport me . '' fernando romero said it was jarring to hear what villalpando says in the video as he gets out of the vehicle . `` my brother-in-law is out of the car with his hands up , '' he said , `` and the first thing he asks is , ` are you going to kill me ? ' '' there 's no sound of any fighting or altercation , but what you do hear , he said , is the profanities the officer repeatedly shouts as villalpando approaches with his hands up . it 's hard to hear exactly what was said , according to romero ; the family believes the officer made a comment claiming villalpando was drunk . police in euless , who are leading the criminal investigation into what happened , told cnn the video does contain foul language . the grapevine police dispute the family 's assertion that villalpando did nothing threatening , saying that `` contrary to clear instructions '' he continued to walk toward the officer after being told repeatedly to stop . but there 's a key thing that 's not shown on the video , police and the family said : the shooting itself . still , fernando romero said the sound of gunshots is clear , piercing through the roar of rush-hour traffic . his sister , villalpando 's widow , was so devastated after seeing the video he had to carry her out of the police station . grapevine police said the video shows the officer did everything he could to keep the situation under control until backup arrived . `` we believe the dash-cam video , as well as information that has already been in the media , clearly demonstrates that officer clark was doing everything in his power , including the use of strong language , to keep mr. villalpando at a safe distance until backup arrived and an arrest -lsb- was -rsb- safely accomplished , '' sgt. robert eberling said in a written statement released thursday . `` members of the media have also been diligent in reporting some of the possible explanations for mr. villalpando 's actions on the night of february 20 , including a previous high-speed chase and a prior arrest for dwi , and a fear that he would be deported . officer clark had no way of knowing mr. villalpando 's nationality at the time the traffic stop was initiated and it may not have been evident on a highway in the late evening . '' marta romero said her husband made a mistake when he did n't stop when the officer tried to pull him over . but she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in . `` he was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer , and in the video you do n't see any of those things , '' she said . `` you see the opposite , a man who is scared , who is simply trying to calm the situation , who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands . '' now she said , she 's seeking justice , hoping the police officer will face the appropriate charges for killing her husband . but she knows the family 's search for answers wo n't be easy . in addition to the doubts swirling in her head , she is faced with questions from her children , even as she tries to explain to them that their father wo n't return . the most devastating of all , she said , is , `` mommy , when is my papa going to wake up ? '' police in euless said they 're also asking plenty of questions . investigators have interviewed more than two dozen witnesses and are searching for more people who might have seen what happened , euless police lt. eric starnes said . clark , who 's worked for the grapevine police since may 2014 , is on administrative leave pending the investigation . grapevine police did not respond to cnn 's request to speak to clark about the incident . the burglar alarm that spurred the officer 's initial response , police later said , turned out to be false . as for the video , grapevine police said they still want the public to see it , but for now , they 're holding off on releasing it because prosecutors have asked for evidence not to be released to the public while an investigation is pending . `` while we understand the interest of the community in the requests to release the video , we must balance those needs with the direction from the district attorney 's office and the respect for the judicial process , '' police said thursday . `` we recognize that much of the sentiment being expressed is based on the understandable grief concerning mr. villalpando 's death . we appreciate the support of our citizens and the fact that they are keeping an open mind and waiting for the results of a complete and thorough investigation .

jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- benjamin netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as israel 's prime minister , declaring victory wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last-minute appeals to right-wing voters . for weeks , netanyahu 's likud party trailed in opinion polls to the zionist union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary israelis better . those polls turned out to be wrong . instead , the likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , israel 's parliament , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee , based on 99 % of the vote . its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government . the zionist union came in second , with at least 24 seats . `` against all odds , against all odds , we achieved this huge victory for likud , '' netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed tuesday . `` we achieved the huge victory for our people . and i am proud , i am proud for the people of israel that in the moment of truth , knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things . '' rather than courting voters in the middle , netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning israel 's security . two weeks ago , he made a controversial speech to the u.s. congress warning of any deal with iran on its nuclear program . then , a few days ago , he declared there would be no palestinian state so long as he 's prime minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the obama administration 's support for a two-state solution . on tuesday , he released a video on facebook claiming leftists were bringing `` huge amounts '' of arabs by bus to vote against likud . arabs make up about 20 % of israel 's population . `` the right regime is in danger , '' netanyahu said . `` we have an urgent wake-up call . bring your friends , bring your family , vote for likud . '' those appeals appear `` to have energized that right-wing base , '' according to cnn 's elise labott . netanyahu still has to form a new government , a process that president reuven rivlin said he hopes will start sunday . if the likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave israel not much different than it was before the election , with a conservative netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug-in opposition . 5 questions about netanyahu 's apparent victory . isaac herzog , who led the zionist union , called netanyahu to concede defeat . but he and fellow opposition leader tzipi livni wo n't go away , with herzog insisting that `` nothing has changed . '' `` this is not the time for coalitions and governments , '' herzog said , apparently ruling out joining forces with netanyahu as the labor party has done before . `` i think what israel is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth . `` and i 'm telling everyone , ` believe , a change will come . ' '' official results will not be released until next week , with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer . no party has ever won a majority of seats in the knesset , meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of israel . the victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61-seat majority . aaron david miller , an ex-adviser to the u.s. government on arab-israeli negotiations now with the wilson center , predicts former israeli communications minister moshe kahlon will be the `` kingmaker '' in any coalition government deal based on the support his kulanu party got tuesday . how does israel 's parliament work ? there 's no guarantee netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister . but he 's got a better chance than anyone , and overnight he vowed to work `` quickly and responsibly to form a new government . '' `` our country 's everyday reality does n't give us the luxury for delay , '' netanyahu said . if he does lead the next government , he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in israel -- thanks to his back-to-back-to-back election wins . many woke up wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that netanyahu 's latest six-year term could be coming to an end . israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the zionist union would win the vote or , at least , finish in a dead heat with likud . exit polls from israel 's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck , not the apparent five-seat advantage that likud appears to have secured . so what happened ? pollster avi degani , who predicted a likud win all along , said other pollsters relied too heavily on internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone . `` the internet does not represent the state of israel and the people of israel , '' degani said , referring to modern statistical methods . `` it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center . '' as netanyahu 's win reverberates , one question remains : did he gain extra seats because of an 11th-hour surge , or were the major polls skewed from the beginning ? why were the election polls so wrong ? netanyahu maintained hard-line positions on settlements and negotiations with palestinians , but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic , social and other issues within israel . saeb erakat , the palestinian chief negotiator with israel , said , `` the results of the israeli elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements , racism , apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the palestinian people . `` such a result would not have been possible had the international community held israel to account for its systematic violations of international law , '' said erakat , who works under palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas . opinion : will netanyahu win seal iran deal ? the post-election view from hamas , the islamist political and militant movement that controls gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union , appeared more resigned . `` hamas does n't see any difference between the israeli parties because they all share the denial of our people 's rights and keeps assaulting them -lrb- people -rrb- , '' said sami abu zuhri , a hamas spokesman , suggesting that it did n't matter much who prevailed tuesday . `` we assure that the palestinian resistance is strong and can impose the facts . '' miller , the wilson center scholar , says he does n't think that netanyahu will necessarily hold his hard campaign line on the palestinians forming their own state if and when he starts his next term . but that does n't mean an elusive peace deal is coming anytime soon . `` i think the two-state solution , sadly , is in a bermuda triangle , sandwiched between a situation that 's too hard for it to be implemented and too important for all of the parties -- including the prime minister , despite what he said , '' miller said . opinion : the danger of netanyahu 's win . cnn 's oren liebermann reported from jerusalem , and faith karimi and greg botelho wrote and reported from atlanta . cnn 's larry register , dana ford and kevin flower contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- robert durst appeared to be prepared for life on the lam when fbi agents arrested him in new orleans . the millionaire heir , according to court documents , had more than $ 40,000 in cash with him -- and a neck-to-head latex mask to alter his appearance . the new details about durst , who 's been charged with first-degree murder , emerged wednesday in court documents supporting a search warrant for his houston home . it 's the latest twist in a whirlwind week for durst , the subject of hbo 's true-crime documentary `` the jinx . '' he 's gone from a man battling suspicions that he killed three people to a frail 71-year-old on suicide watch . durst , whose real estate developer family is among new york 's wealthiest , has a net worth of about $ 100 million and had been withdrawing large sums of money from various bank accounts , including daily withdrawals of $ 9,000 over 35 days since october , the court documents said . he 's being held on drug and weapons charges in louisiana as he awaits extradition to los angeles to face charges in the 2000 killing of his close friend . it 's not the first time he 's been accused of murder . he admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense . and while he 's never been charged in his first wife 's 1982 disappearance , her family members say they believe she 's dead and that he 's the one to blame . fbi agents are also investigating whether durst could be connected to other unsolved murder cases . the agency is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said . unsolved cases in vermont , upstate new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look . durst 's apparent plans to flee began to unravel on saturday , after an fbi agent approached him from behind at a new orleans hotel and said , `` mr. durst ? '' although durst had checked into the hotel under the name `` everette ward '' and carried a texas id card with that name , he turned around when the agent called him by name , according to court documents . in his hotel room , agents found more than $ 40,000 in cash , mostly in $ 100 bills packed into small envelopes , a loaded revolver , the rubber mask that covers the head and neck , his actual birth certificate and passport , and marijuana . on tuesday , authorities made it clear they were n't done looking into durst , even though he 's behind bars . at the houston condominium building where durst owns three units and lived for many years , authorities seized compact discs , bank statements , handwritten notes , credit cards and checks , stationery , a cell phone , boxes of court documents , photos and a trash bag of court transcripts . they also left with copies of books that detail the disappearance of his first wife and his legal troubles : `` without a trace '' and paperback and hardcover copies of `` a deadly secret . '' journalist matt birkbeck , who wrote `` a deadly secret , '' said he 'd heard durst read his book , but did n't realize he still had two copies . `` when i first heard that , i was somewhat shocked , '' birkbeck told cnn , `` and a little disturbed . '' the los angeles county district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against durst on monday . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . prosecutors accuse durst of `` lying in wait '' and killing susan berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she `` was a witness to a crime . '' berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills , california , home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst , in 1982 . durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance . he 's confined to a louisiana prison 's mental health unit after being deemed a danger to himself . on tuesday , an appeals court granted a request from the orleans parish sheriff 's office to move durst to the elayn hunt correctional center 's mental health unit in st. gabriel , about an hour 's drive from new orleans . lawyers for the sheriff 's office argued that the jail where durst was being held until tuesday night ca n't accommodate inmates with acute mental health conditions . the appeals court agreed . durst 's lawyer dick deguerin said he `` did not believe '' his client was mentally ill , and that he should remain in orleans parish to give the legal team better access to him before a evidentiary hearing scheduled for monday . deguerin has said it 's no coincidence authorities arrested durst the day before the hbo documentary 's final episode aired . he said he was n't surprised about the search of his texas condo , either . `` they 're acting like a bunch of keystone kops , particularly after being embarrassed by the tv program , '' he said . `` and i 'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever . '' authorities have been mum about what evidence led them to arrest durst on saturday , the day before the finale of `` the jinx '' aired . court documents reveal some details about their case against him . four forensic experts concluded a letter sent to police telling them to search for a cadaver in berman 's home was likely written by durst . for viewers of the hbo documentary , that might not come as a surprise . in `` the jinx , '' berman 's stepson stumbles upon a signed letter from durst to berman 's home in beverly hills . the handwriting looks similar to the `` cadaver '' letter that tipped off police to the killing , and both letters misspell the word as `` beverley . '' in the documentary , durst denies he has anything to do with writing the `` cadaver '' letter , and that he has anything to do with berman 's death . court documents mention another anonymous letter , sent from new york in january 2001 , to a los angeles police detective . it was titled `` possible motive for susan berman murder '' and stated that berman suspected durst of being involved in his wife 's disappearance . it also said durst planned to visit berman around the time of her death . in a 2003 murder trial , durst admitted he 'd killed neighbor morris black in galveston , texas , and chopped up the body . he was acquitted after his attorneys argued he had acted in self-defense , though he later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case . deguerin told reporters monday that his client did n't kill berman . `` he 's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial , '' deguerin said . it 's not clear when a trial would take place . durst waived his right to fight extradition to los angeles , but because prosecutors in new orleans are pursuing charges against him , he remains jailed there . investigators believe he planned to travel from new orleans to cuba , a law enforcement official told cnn . investigators found a .38 - caliber smith & wesson revolver and about 147 grams -lrb- 5.2 ounces -rrb- of marijuana in durst 's hotel room in new orleans , according to court documents . he was booked on charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance . court documents filed tuesday say durst will receive medications while imprisoned , `` including but not limited to hydrocodone as needed for pain .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the death of the founding father of singapore last monday is an appropriate occasion to reflect on nation building . as prime minister for its first three decades , lee kuan yew raised a poor port from the bottom rungs of the third world to the first world in a single generation . as it prepares to mark its 50th anniversary as a nation , singapore is today an ultra-modern metropolis of almost six million people with higher per capita gdp than the united states , according to the world bank . lee 's achievement in building a successful nation contrasts sharply with the results of washington 's expenditure of over $ 4 trillion and nearly 7,000 american lives in iraq and afghanistan over the past decade . some say singapore 's story is sui generis : something that could only happen in that time and place . but its remarkable performance has less to do with miraculous conditions than with lee 's model of disciplined , visionary leadership . leaders of other aspiring-to-develop nations , and even the u.s. , should take pages from lee kuan yew 's playbook to address current challenges . we know many of lee 's lessons on the role of government leadership in development because my co-authors and i asked him directly two years ago to reflect on them -- points we captured in our book , lee kuan yew : the grand master 's insights on china , the united states , and the world . five stand out . first , lee insisted that governance was first and foremost about results . in his words , `` the acid test of any legal system is not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts , but whether , in fact , it is able to produce order and justice . '' about the core purposes of government , he was crystal clear . in terms america 's founding fathers would recognize , he believed that `` the ultimate test of the value of a political system is whether it helps that society establish conditions which improve the standard of living for the majority of its people , plus enabling the maximum of personal freedoms compatible with the freedoms of others in society . '' second , superior performance requires superior leadership . lee demanded of leaders both intellectual and moral superiority . contrary to modern western democratic theory that emphasizes citizens ' participation in governance , his views were closer to plato 's conception of the `` guardians , '' or china 's historical mandarins . good government requires most of all leaders who put the public good unquestionably above their own personal interests . he was disappointed by many of his counterparts who failed that test . third , successful societies guarantee strict equality of opportunity for all individuals , but are realistic about the fact that this will yield substantial inequalities in outcomes . for lee , the essence of a successful society was intense competition on a level playing field that allows each individual to achieve his or her maximum . few things offended him more than denial of equality of opportunity on the basis of caste -lrb- india -rrb- , class -lrb- europe -rrb- , race -lrb- the u.s. during segregation -rrb- , sex , or other irrelevant attributes . as he put it , the leader 's objective was to `` build up a society in which people will be rewarded not according to the amount of property they own , but according to their active contribution to society in physical or mental labor . '' fourth , about democracy , particularly western liberal democracy , lee had serious reservations . in part , this attitude stemmed from his own experience , but it also reflected a deeper philosophical aversion to ideologies . as he liked to say , `` the acid test is performance , not promises . the millions dispossessed in asia care not and know not of theory . they want a better life . they want a more equal , just society . '' lee enjoyed engaging american critics who insisted that without democracy singapore could not develop an advanced economy . in contrast , he argued that what most countries needed was more `` discipline , '' rather than democracy . he noted that the u.s. had been building democracy and giving aid to the philippines for over a century . but , he asked , how many people from singapore sought to leave it for the philippines ? many people in the philippines , he noted , wanted to move to singapore . on one occasion , with a broad smile , he continued , `` and you will notice that since the vietnam war and the great society , the u.s. system has not functioned even for the united states . '' fifth , which leaders did he most admire ? from the recent past , he focused on three : charles de gaulle , deng xiaoping , and winston churchill . `` de gaulle , because he had tremendous guts ; deng , because he changed china from a broken-backed state , which would have imploded like the soviet union , into what it is today ; and `` churchill , because any other person would have given up .

sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- a coalition of middle eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in yemen from the air on friday , the second day of a campaign aimed at the houthi group . while it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction , the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around sanaa on friday night suggested that the saudi-led strikes were taking a toll . the strikes ' target is houthi rebels , a shiite muslim minority group that has taken over the capital and , on wednesday , captured key parts of the yemeni port city of aden . aden was where president abdu rabu mansour hadi had moved because of the rebel advance . hadi has since left yemen , and on friday he 'd arrived in egypt for a summit of arab league representatives . many nations in the arab league are now participating in the armed effort against the houthis and presumably to return hadi to yemen as its leader . while he 's not in yemen , the fierce fighting there continues . not surprisingly , the houthis are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in sanaa . that includes at least 10 killed in the northwestern province of saada , home to the houthi 's leader abdul malik al houthi , houthi commanders said . more than a dozen more people were wounded , as 15 locations saw airstrikes . five houthis died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to hadi on a houthi post about 6 miles -lrb- 10 kilometers -rrb- outside al anad airbase , two security officials in lahj province said . that 's where u.s. special operations forces involved in fighting al qaeda in the arabian peninsula had been based as recently as this month . hadi has also ordered the closure of all houthi-controlled media -- including yemen tv and saba tv . the houthis , though , responded by raiding two tv channels and the prominent al masdar newspaper . al jazeera 's office in sanaa was also targeted , with houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment , the qatar-based network said . the nations stepping into yemen 's civil war are predominantly sunni muslim , and they are working to rescue a government that has strong sunni support . the houthis are allied with majority shiite iran . saudi arabia , the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed al-hazm storm , considers the houthis to be proxies for the shiite government of iran and fear another shiite-dominated state in the region . `` what they do not want is an iranian-run state on their southern border , '' cnn military analyst lt. col. rick francona said of the saudis . the kingdom says hadi , who is out of the country , pleaded for military intervention in a letter . `` i ask you , based on the principle of self-defense in article 51 of the charter of the united nations , and on the basis of the charter of the arab league and the treaty of joint arab defense , to provide instant support by all necessary means , including military intervention to protect yemen and its people from continuous houthi aggression , '' read the letter , which was posted by saudi arabia 's foreign ministry . u.s. secretary of state john kerry said thursday that the united states commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , a senior state department official said . the other nations participating in the military action are the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , sudan and egypt , a saudi adviser has said . the adviser also included pakistan , saying its military was offering naval support . but on friday , that country 's defense ministry said it had only vowed to defend saudi arabia , according to a local media report . saudi arabia and egypt have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops . saudi arabia has blockaded the houthis , effectively cutting off their supply lines . by thursday afternoon , the saudis controlled yemeni airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter yemeni ports . supreme leader al houthi spoke live thursday night in yemen on al-masirah tv , saying , `` if any army tries to invade our country , we will prove that yemen will be a grave for those who invade us . '' iran denounced the military intervention . marzieh afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's foreign ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to yemen 's months-long internal strife . it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like isis and al qaeda , she said . `` this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , '' afkham said , according to a report in iran 's state-run islamic republic news agency . at least one major player in yemen besides the houthis -- the general people 's congress , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out . the gpc says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties . the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said . opinion : why yemen has come undone . journalist hakim almasmari reported from yemen , and cnn 's greg botelho and ben brumfield wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's samira said , becky anderson , nick paton walsh , anas hamdan , salma abdelaziz and mustafa al-arab contributed to this report .
new delhi -lrb- cnn -rrb- the quest to be educated in india has literally scaled new heights . images of parents and family members clambering up school buildings and clinging on window ledges to pass cheat sheets to their children have left authorities in despair . the incident took place on wednesday in the state of bihar , where students were writing their year-end grade 10 examinations . examples of cheating incidents are not hard to find in india . but , even compared to previous events , this seems to be unprecedented in its blatancy . bihar education minister pk shahi told reporters that children wo n't learn if they 're constantly helped by family members . `` government can only hold fair examinations with the help of the parents , society and the children , '' he said . `` this is a collective responsibility . '' in a developing economy like india , education is a precious commodity . with more than 1.2 billion people , proper schooling could hold the key for much of the population to get out of a vicious cycle of poverty . earlier this week , a father in the city of mathura was caught strapping his 8-year old daughter to a motorcycle after she refused to attend school to take her assessment . tied with a multi-strand rope to the back of a bike , onlookers captured images of the trussed girl , her bare feet hanging low , scraping the asphalt . according to local police officials , the girl 's parents offered her several incentives , such as chocolates and toys to entice her , however when the girl was still reluctant , her father decided to take matters in his own hands . after photos started making the rounds on social media , police officials took the man into custody and charged him with `` breach of the peace . '' he is now out on bail . `` even after he got out , the father showed no remorse . he has five children to feed and he believes the only way they can get out of this poverty trap is through education , '' a senior police official handling the case told cnn . the flaws in india 's education system are well-documented . the country has a literacy rate of only 74 % , compared to 95 % in china . women suffer particularly badly here ; only 64 % have formal education . earlier this year , indian prime minister narendra modi launched a nationwide campaign urging parents to send their children , especially daughters , to school and properly educate them . according to the united nations , india has the largest youth population in the world , with more than a quarter of citizens aged between 10 and 24 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` completely false . '' that 's how police are responding to allegations that they beat the man arrested for shooting two police officers during protests in ferguson , missouri , last week . jeffrey williams , 20 , has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault , a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity . police have said he admitted to firing the shots that struck the officers . but williams ' lawyer says he has little confidence in such statements . `` he 's scared . you know , this has been pretty traumatic for him , '' attorney jerryl christmas said about his client on monday . `` one thing that is clear is that he has a large amount of bruising on his body that i noticed that i 'm very concerned about . it appears that whatever statements he made , he was without the advice of counsel , and when i look at the bruising , it 's hard for me assess if these were voluntary statements that he made . '' christmas told cnn that williams has bruising across his back , and a knot on his head . `` he said he was bruised by the police when he was taken into custody . and he was in a lot of pain when he was being questioned , '' christmas said . `` they used a lot of force on him . '' opinion : why would you want to be a cop ? police deny the accusation . `` with regard to the allegations that jeffrey williams was ` beaten ' by police , the st. louis county police department calls these allegations completely false , '' sgt. brian schellman said in a statement . `` immediately following the arrest , arresting officers transported williams to st. louis county police headquarters where he was interviewed by crimes against persons detectives . this entire interview was video and audio recorded . '' schellman also said that williams was seen by a nurse , who released williams as `` fit for confinement . '' williams is being held on a cash-only $ 300,000 bond , according to st. louis county prosecuting attorney bob mcculloch , who said it 's possible williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case . the prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest . he said police served a search warrant on williams ' residence where they seized a .40 - caliber handgun , `` which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered '' at the scene of the shooting . one element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent , mcculloch said , adding that williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he was n't aiming at the police officers . investigators are not sure they `` buy '' williams ' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals , mcculloch said , but he did n't rule it out . the tough task ahead for ferguson 's next police chief . after speaking to his client , christmas said that it 's clear to him there was no intent to target police . for more than 200 days , protests have taken place in ferguson since the august shooting death of unarmed black teenager michael brown . ferguson police officer darren wilson was not indicted . according to his attorney , williams was not part of the protest community , and does not have a history of violence . `` i clearly think that we do n't have the right person in custody , '' christmas said . cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- racist emails -- like one that depicted president obama as a chimpanzee -- resulted in three ferguson , missouri , city employees resigning or being fired , the city spokesman said friday . police officers capt. rick henke and sgt. william mudd resigned thursday over the emails discovered during the u.s. department of justice investigation of racial prejudice in the city 's police and judicial system , city spokesman jeff small said on friday , citing the city attorney . the city 's top court clerk , mary ann twitty , was fired earlier this week in connection with the emails , small said . several employees forwarded the emails but until now none had been disciplined , the report said . examples of the racist emails include one sent in october 2011 that showed a photo of bare-chested dancing women , apparently in africa , with the caption `` michelle obama 's high school reunion . '' a june 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were `` mixed in color , unemployed , lazy , ca n't speak english and have no ... clue who their daddies are . '' some critics have called for the department to be disbanded and for police chief thomas jackson to resign . in a friday interview with cnn 's sara sidner , ferguson mayor james knowles said jackson was not copied on any of the emails . when asked if jackson and the city manager may be fired , knowles said , `` we 're going to do our due diligence and hold people accountable . '' knowles also said he does n't think the department will be disbanded . when asked about what happens next in ferguson , u.s. attorney general eric holder said friday , `` we are prepared to use all the power that we have , all the power that we have to ensure that the situation changes there . and that means everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure . '' when a reporter asked if that included dismantling the police force , holder replied , `` if that 's what 's necessary then we are prepared to do that . '' holder ordered the investigation after a white police officer , darren wilson , shot and killed black teenager michael brown last summer , setting off months of sometimes violent street protests in the town outside st. louis . the doj declined to bring charges against wilson , who has since left the force . no state charges were filed either . in a separate report , the justice department described what it said was a `` pattern and practice '' of discrimination against african-americans by the ferguson police and municipal courts . that discrimination included racist emails . ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is 67 % african-american . among the findings in the report : . from 2012 to 2014 , 85 % of people subject to vehicle stops by ferguson police were african-american , 90 % of those who received citations were black , and 93 % of people arrested were black . in 88 % of the cases in which ferguson police officers reported using force , it was against african-americans . from 2012-2014 black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during traffic stops , but 26 % less likely to be found in possession of contraband . president obama said friday that although he does n't think the abuses of power in ferguson are typical of america , there are individuals and possibly whole departments in american law enforcement that may struggle to prevent prejudice in their ranks . `` i do n't think that is typical of what happens across the country , but it 's not an isolated incident , '' obama said in an early morning interview on siriusxm 's urban view channel . `` i think there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement has broken down , and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure they are protecting , serving all people , and not just some . '' knowles has outlined a number of reforms the city implemented to address some of the justice department 's concerns , and said the city `` must do better '' to address racism . `` we must all work to address issues of racial disparity in all aspects of our society , '' he said wednesday . ferguson police chief mum on federal report . cnn 's sara sidner contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- you would be pressed to find a designer who appealed to the imagination as much as alexander mcqueen . a favorite with a-listers and fashion editors alike , he was renowned for his gothic sensibilities , innovative textiles -lrb- think shells , horns and hair -rrb- and highly conceptual runway shows , as well as his bad boy antics behind the scenes . -lrb- along with the usual drinks , drugs and parties , he once claimed to have stitched profanities into the lining of a jacket for prince charles . -rrb- . five years after his death , interest in the designer has n't waned , least of all in his home town of london , where , starting this month , he 's being commemorated with an extensive , expensive retrospective at the victoria and albert museum . alexander mcqueen : savage beauty , a re-staging of the 2011 exhibition at new york 's metropolitan museum of art , summarizes and contextualizes mcqueen 's 18-year career through an elaborate display of 244 garments and accessories . `` savage beauty at the v&a is the largest and most ambitious fashion exhibition the museum has ever staged , '' said curator claire wilcox at a press preview . the v&a has already sold 70,000 advanced tickets , and extended the exhibition by two weeks to meet demand . at the met , savage beauty attracted over 660,000 visitors by the end of its four-month run , making it one of the museum 's top 10 exhibitions of all time , up there with a king tut stop in 1978 and a mona lisa loan in 1963 . bringing savage beauty to london can be seen as a `` homecoming , '' as it was described by v&a director martin roth at the press preview , if not an act of repatriation . the son of cab driver and a school teacher , alexander `` lee '' mcqueen grew up in london 's east end . after dropping out of school at 16 , he honed his tailoring skills on savile row , graduated with an ma in fashion design from the city 's prestigious central saint martins college , and used the v&a 's archives to research his collections . he once said of london : `` it 's where my heart is , and where i get my inspiration . '' that love was largely reciprocated . in 2011 , thousands of british devotees petitioned to have savage beauty brought to london after its spectacular new york debut . fashion journalist melanie rickey was one of the most vocal proponents . a longtime fan , she has coauthored the upcoming release inferno : alexander mcqueen -lrb- laurence king -rrb- , a coffee table book of interviews and images from photographer kent baker , which documents march 1996 collection dante . `` i was agitated because -lrb- savage beauty -rrb- really is meant to be in his hometown , '' rickey says . `` everything about him is london , so to not have it in london would have been a crime . '' along with hounding the brand 's corporate honchos and the v&a itself , rickey started an online petition to have the exhibition brought to the city , and instigated the twitter hashtag #bringmcqueenexhibitionhome . `` it 's like the -lrb- elgin -rrb- marbles : they 're probably a lot more powerful in greece than they are sitting in the british museum . '' ultimately , such advocacy may have been unnecessary . according to kate bethune , senior exhibition research assistant for savage beauty , it had been roth 's ambition to bring the exhibition to london since he assumed the directorship in september 2011 . the v&a exhibition , which was announced last april , even begins with a newly added london gallery dedicated to mcqueen 's roots in the city and his early shows . curators called on sam gainsbury , who produced all of mcqueen 's shows from 1996 on , to act as the exhibition 's creative director and bring mcqueen 's pieces to life . `` a lot of -lrb- mcqueen 's -rrb- colleagues say he started his collections with the concept of a show , '' bethune says . `` he always wanted people to have a strong reaction to what he was going . '' the most theatrical highlights include the romantic primitivism gallery , covered with fake bones like an ossuary , and a blacked-out room where a kate moss hologram floats in a diaphanous dress , trapped in a glass pyramid . the room-sized cabinet of curiosities has 27 screens showing moments of his most imaginative runway shows : women walk on water , a model 's gown is spray-painted by robotic arms , a church is converted into a catwalk . but bethune believes the real draw will be the groundbreaking pieces made from unconventional materials , which blur the line between fashion and art . fairytale gowns feature throughout and there 's a whole section dedicated to mcqueen 's tailoring skills , but it 's the garments made from razor clam shells , pheasant feathers , and synthetic hair ; or embellished with impala horns and baby crocodile heads that really standout . the accessories -- extravagant headpieces , swarovski mesh chain mail , impossible shoes -- seem like sculptures . `` mcqueen was an artist whose medium of expression was fashion , '' she says . `` he absolutely changed the way we look at fashion . '' alexander mcqueen : savage beauty runs from march 14 - august 2 , 2015 at the victoria and albert museum in london . for more information , visit www.vam.ac.uk/savagebeauty .

london -lrb- cnn -rrb- archaeologists have started excavating about 3,000 skeletons from the bedlam burial ground in london , used from 1569 to at least 1738 . also known as bethlem and the new churchyard , more than 20,000 londoners are believed to have been buried there . the ground was used by `` a varied cross-section of society throughout the years since the burial ground was open , '' nick elsden , project manager from mola -lrb- museum of london archaeology -rrb- told cnn . and they include those who could not afford a church burial or chose to perish there for religious or political reasons . the ground also contained the overflow of bodies when other cemeteries became full . bedlam , now a synonym for chaos , took its name from the hospital of st mary of bethlehem in london which nursed the mentally ill . among the deceased are victims of the english civil war , the great plague of 1665 and the great fire of london in the following year . the site was found at an entrance of the city 's new liverpool street crossrail station -- part of a # 14.8 billion -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- project that will expand london 's railway network . a team of 60 archaeologists will work six days a week on the project , expected to finish in september this year . hundreds of skeletons found under paris supermarket . elsden said the excavation reveals a great deal about how londoners lived from the 16th to the 18th century . `` a large sample of the population from that period will enable us to look at the lifestyle , looking at roman london and what the romans were doing in the suburb area , outside the city walls . '' he said the skeletons will be cleaned and closely examined by experts who will assess their remains to determine their diseases , ages and sexes . `` specialists will look at the dna of the disease that killed the person rather than their own dna , '' he added . roman skulls unearthed deep beneath london . the findings are timely as well -- this year marks the 350th anniversary of the great plague in london . `` 1665 was the very last recorded episode of plague . there were 400 years of regular plague , and suddenly it stops , '' jay carver , crossrail 's lead archaeologist , said . `` and what we want to be able to find out , from sampling the graves of that date , is why that is . and what it is about the bacteria that causes bubonic plague that suddenly changed at that point . '' londoners also assisted in the research by helping to search parish records to identify people who were buried in bedlam . `` and that was a huge exercise which could n't have possibly been done by our own team , '' carver said . skeletons found holding hands after 700 years . the result is a database of more than 5,300 names and backgrounds of those buried at bedlam , including political activists john lilburne and robert lockyer -- part of a movement known as the levellers -- as well as ambrose nicholas , the lord mayor of london in 1575 . a roman road that runs underneath the site has already produced artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns . carver describes the bedlam dig as a personal career highlight .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- scientists have raised concerns about a large , rapidly thinning glacier in antarctica , warning it could contribute significantly to rising sea levels . they say they 've discovered two openings that could channel warm seawater to the base of the huge totten glacier and bring the threat of potentially disastrous melting . the glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in east antarctica . it contains enough ice to raise the global sea level by at least 11 feet -lrb- 3.4 meters -rrb- , according to researchers from the university of texas at austin who were among the authors of a new study published this week in the journal nature geoscience . scientists had previously detected warm water on the seaward side of the glacier . but until now , they had found no evidence that it could threaten coastal ice . `` we now know there are avenues for the warmest waters in east antarctica to access the most sensitive areas of totten glacier , '' said jamin greenbaum , a university of texas ph.d. candidate and the lead author of the study . the two gateways on the seafloor that lead to the base of the glacier offer an explanation for why totten glacier has been melting so fast . scientists have already warned about the consequences of melting ice in west antarctica . nasa said last year that glacial retreat in some areas `` appears unstoppable . '' the increase in sea levels that would be caused by the melting of all the ice in totten glacier is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the contribution from a collapse of the entire west antarctic ice sheet . the united nations ' report on climate change last year estimated sea levels could rise between 1 foot and 3 feet by 2100 . such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world . but that calculation does n't factor in the latest research on antarctica . `` while the totten melt may take several centuries , once change has begun our analysis reveals it would likely be irreversible , '' greenbaum said in comments cited by the australian antarctic division . to prevent the process from becoming unstoppable , atmospheric and oceanic conditions would need to change so that snowfall outpaces coastal melting , the researchers said . the scientists gathered their data through a series of aerial surveys using technology that can scan the ice and seafloors in areas that are inaccessible to icebreakers . the team included researchers from the united states , australia and the united kingdom .

'' the actor , who is also an advocate for women 's rights , added : `` the amount of gender violence that i experience is absolutely extraordinary , and a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that 's directed at me on social media . '' twitter , trolls and sports collided recently in another high-profile social media fight involving former major league baseball pitcher curt schilling . schilling had congratulated his daughter on joining her new college 's softball team in a tweet that was met with sexually menacing replies . he tracked down some of the men who sent inappropriate tweets , resulting in one reportedly being fired from his part-time job with the new york yankees . twitter ceo dick costolo has admitted the company has a less than stellar track record for cracking down on abusive tweets . `` we suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we 've sucked at it for years , '' costolo wrote in a february memo . he told employees that he was embarrassed and took `` personal responsibility '' for the company 's failure to address abuse . costolo said he was committed to addressing the issue . this month the company updated its terms of service to directly combat so-called `` revenge porn '' that is posted to the site . revenge porn is sexually explicit material posted online without the consent of one or more participants . just today , the company debuted a new feature it says will make the process of reporting abusive tweets to law enforcement more seamless . the site will now email a report that can be shared with law enforcement after a user reports an abusive tweet . `` while we take threats of violence seriously and will suspend responsible accounts when appropriate , we strongly recommend contacting your local law enforcement if you 're concerned about your physical safety , '' twitter says . david goldman contributed to this report .

'' on wednesday , joint iraqi forces gained control of tikrit military hospital , a few blocks south of the presidential palace . it 's part of their ongoing quest to wrest control from isis , which captured the city last year . the predominantly shiite militia has been working with iraqi troops as well as sunni fighters to try to regain tikrit . tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isis , which has captured large areas of iraq and syria for what it says is its islamic caliphate . on march 1 , iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salaheddin province . isis was n't making it easy , however . the sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near tikrit , preventing the joint iraqi forces from using it to cross the tigris river to approach the city from the east . nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing isis fighters to retreat toward the city center from front-line positions , hashd al-shaabi 's media office said . there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014 . if iraq regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible . the tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters . also assisting is iran , which has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraqi government . according to the pentagon , iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well . gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff , told a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee on wednesday that the consensus was that iran 's involvement was positive in military terms . `` anything anyone does to counter isis is in the main a good outcome , '' he said . but dempsey also voiced concern over what might happen after isis is defeated . a key question , he said , is `` whether the government of iraq will remain on a path to provide an inclusive government for all of the groups '' in iraq . tikrit could act as an important testing ground , with some observers concerned that if the predominantly shiite militias seize control , thanks in part to the support of majority-shiite iran , they could carry out reprisal attacks against the remaining sunni population there . such attacks could inflame already simmering sectarian tensions within iraq and make future efforts to retake mosul and bring peace to the country yet more difficult . in a possible sign of the problems to come , a number of posts on social media appear to show iraqi soldiers in extremely graphic `` selfies '' with the heads of alleged isis militants , or striking odd poses with bodies behind them . most of the photos are thought to have been taken during the iraqi military offensive to retake tikrit and other areas in salaheddin province , which started 10 days ago . two senior security officials in samarra told cnn , on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media , that they are looking into these claims and they are also investigating similar incidents . they did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the images . anthony cordesman , a security expert at the center for strategic and international studies , said sectarian division was an issue to be `` extremely concerned '' about as iraqi forces gain ground in tikrit . `` it 's already been very clear to iraqis that this is an iranian-led operation and not one which has the support of the coalition , '' he said . as some iraqis question why the united states has not taken more decisive action , he said , `` this may be a case where iran may be gaining very serious influence . '' if there are reprisals in tikrit and it becomes a `` shiite-on-sunni struggle , '' cordesman said , then not only will iran 's influence increase `` but you can see the country divide and islamic state -lrb- isis -rrb- be replaced by a conflict between iraqi shiite and sunni . '' strong leadership will be needed from the government in baghdad , headed by al-abadi , militia leaders and senior religious figures to prevent this outcome , he said , with a lot already being done on this front . the top iraqi shiite cleric , grand ayatollah ali al-sistani , he said , `` very clearly says that iraqis must act as iraqis , not divide along sectarian lines . '' the challenge will be ensuring that fighters on the ground , some angered by the killings of their relatives by isis , do not seek vengeance against sunni communities whom they suspect of supporting the group . while iraqi forces piled the pressure on isis in tikrit , the sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in iraq 's western anbar province , where it is finding a support base among the predominantly sunni population . more than 40 iraqi soldiers were killed when isis blew up the iraqi army headquarters just outside ramadi , an anbar provincial leader told cnn on thursday . militants dug a tunnel and detonated hundreds of homemade explosives , said sabah al-karhout , head of the anbar provincial council . isis launched a new offensive on ramadi , west of baghdad , on wednesday morning , faleh al-issawi , the deputy head of the council , said in a statement . the city is being attacked `` from all directions , '' with isis firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets , he said , and explosives-laden vehicles used to attack security checkpoints and a bridge . officials believe `` this is an isis response to the tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north , '' al-issawi said . u.s.-led coalition forces carried out 13 airstrikes in iraq between wednesday and thursday morning , a statement said . five hit isis targets near kirkuk , and three struck isis units and a vehicle near falluja . elsewhere in anbar province , iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of karma , near falluja , from isis , said sabah al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council , on wednesday . iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with shiite hashd al-shaabi units and local tribesmen , al-karhout said . isis is also battling in many places far from tikrit , including syria , where the militant group is more on the offensive , according to the syrian observatory for human rights , a london-based monitoring group . clashes continued thursday between the kurdish people 's protection units , or kurdish ypg , and isis fighters in ras al ayn , a syrian strategic border town with turkey , the syrian observatory said in a statement . hundreds of isis militants launched a large-scale offensive wednesday in the town , the group said . dozens have been killed from both sides . cnn 's ben wedeman reported from baghdad , and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's mohammed tawfeeq , hamdi alkhshali , kareem khadder and arwa damon contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in an audio message purportedly from an isis spokesman , the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from nigerian-based boko haram has been accepted by isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . the 28-minute message , which can not be independently authenticated by cnn , was posted online by isis supporters . the message says that the caliphate , or islamic state , has expanded to western africa and congratulated `` our jihadi brothers '' there . the spokesman , abu mohammed al adnani , encourages people to join fighters in africa if they can not make it to iraq or syria . boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , announced in an audio message last week that the islamist terror group was going to ally with isis . jacob zenn , a terror expert who lives in nigeria , told cnn on saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups . `` boko haram will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands , '' zenn said . `` it will also get guidance from isis in media warfare and propaganda . previously boko haram was a sort of outcast in the global jihadi community . now it is perhaps isis 's biggest affiliate . `` isis gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate . '' boko haram , whose name translates as `` western education is sin , '' has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of sharia law . boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques . much of this violence has taken place in nigeria . but neighboring countries , such as cameroon and chad , have also been hit increasingly hard . what boko haram 's pledge of allegiance to isis means . cnn 's paul cruickshank contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the campaign to retake the city of tikrit from isis , also known as the islamic state , involves a curious mixture of iraqi forces -- the army and air force , federal police , powerful shia militia as well as sunni tribal fighters . it 's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure . and that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one-third of those fighters are from the regular army . a cnn team that 's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that iraqi army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the shia militia , notably hadi al ameri , leader of the badr organization . iranian military advisers are on hand , and highly influential on the battlefield . as isis fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands , it might seem odd that the iraqi army is unable to take them on alone . after all , the iraqi security forces -lrb- isf -rrb- received $ 20 billion of u.s. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment , bases and training . so just why are the isf incapable of reclaiming territory seized by isis ? and how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet ? the answers go back to the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2003 ; iraq 's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade . one of the most controversial acts of the u.s.-led coalition provisional authority , which ran iraq following the ouster of saddam hussein , was to disband the iraqi army . the decision , taken in may 2003 , `` immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the u.s. occupiers , '' as james p. pfiffner put it in 2010 . president george w. bush told his biographer robert draper in 2006 : `` the policy had been to keep the -lsb- iraqi -rsb- army intact ; did n't happen . '' the reasons have been disputed ever since . in some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers ; at the same time training of iraqi police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency . in 2004 , as in 2014 , the security forces buckled as a sunni insurgency spread through northern and western iraq . billions of dollars were spent creating a new iraqi army from scratch . but it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions , so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away . over a seven-year period , more than $ 4 billion was spent on renovating and building iraqi bases . logistical and maintenance support : $ 2.6 billion . supply of equipment : $ 3.4 billion -lrb- in addition to what the iraqis bought themselves . -rrb- training and staffing the iraqi police : a cool $ 9.4 billion . with u.s. assistance and the `` sons of iraq '' program to coax sunni tribes into fighting al qaeda in iraq , violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010 . but once u.s. forces left at the end of 2011 , and with them intelligence-gathering and training programs , things began to unravel . by then , the iraqi security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty . the only effective units were special forces such as the golden division . sophisticated u.s. equipment , such as m-1 abrams battle tanks , was not maintained . corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially . as then prime minister nouri al-maliki tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013 , the high command of the iraqi military became a political football -- with loyalty to al-maliki prized above competence . he bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies . the institute for the study of war reported in 2013 , `` the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-maliki to choose his preferred officers -lrb- nearly all shia -rrb- to head the most significant command positions in iraq . '' al-maliki also began integrating shia militia into army units . at the same time , the phenomenon of `` ghost soldiers '' went unchecked -- men who were either dead or awol but whose wages were still being paid , often to corrupt commanders . so the army , in numbers , looked much stronger than it was . in fact , by the time isis rolled south , the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000 . nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as isis fighters stormed south from syria in the early summer of 2014 . isis used speed , discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the iraqi army did n't have . it had also cultivated allies among members of sunni tribes ready to act as a fifth column , and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee . the desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to shia shrines in samarra prompted a rapid mobilization of shia militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the badr organization and the asaib ahl al-haq . some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the al-assad regime in syria . in june , the most respected religious authority among iraqi shi'ites , grand ayatollah ali al-sistani , appealed to iraqis to mobilize against the enemy . the call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of shia , determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of saddam hussein 's baathist regime . the militia -- called al hashed al shabi or popular mobilization units -lrb- pmu -rrb- -- were trained , equipped and most importantly led by iranian military advisers and quickly became battle hardened . what they lacked in military skills , they made up for in determination . the iranians have invested heavily in the pmus . the commander of iran 's revolutionary guards quds force , gen. qassim suleimani , seems to have spent more time in iraq than iran since last summer and has been photographed around tikrit . according to several analysts , it is suleimani that has been organizing and directing the shia militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations . christopher harmer of the institute for the study of war says the role of both the iranians and the shia militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the isf . and he says that `` if the tikrit operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the iraqi government 's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the iranians and the pmu are going to demand payback . '' the role of suleimani and al quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in washington 's view -- means that us airpower has not been made available . `` the u.s. may not like iranian influence in iraq , '' says harmer , `` but what it absolutely can not do is provide direct support to an iranian-led military operation . '' the chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff , gen. martin dempsey , alluded to the dilemma when in baghdad on monday . `` what i 'm trying to sort out , actually , is the degree to which their near-term embrace of the assistance they 're receiving from iran is a reaction to the existential threat -lsb- posed by isis -rsb- , or whether it is something longer-term , '' he said . soon after taking office , iraqi prime minister haider al abadi fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement . at the time a statement on his website stressed `` the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels . '' u.s.-led efforts to train a new iraqi army designed to defeat isis are well underway . the aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of kurdish peshmerga . these should be ready for operations by the end of this year ; the first brigade has already completed basic training . but as harmer notes , `` the iraqi security forces are yet to go head-to-head with isis and win without help from the pmus . isis is demonstrably more capable than the isf . '' clearing isis from well-entrenched defenses around mosul , iraq 's second largest city , seems well beyond the army 's capability . in november , gen. dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city . that 's problematic for several reasons . kurdish officials told cnn last month that the longer the battle for mosul is delayed , the tougher it will be . they claim that they can not maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely . the iraqi government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there . but above all , the need for shia militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely sunni cities is fraught with peril . human rights watch has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against sunni communities by the militia . tikrit is an especially sensitive area : in june last year , isis massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets , the vast majority shia , at camp speicher . some families of the murdered recruits , and a few survivors , have claimed local sunni tribes may have helped isis or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage . hrw middle east deputy director joe stork says that `` past fighting raises grave concerns that tikrit 's civilians are at serious risk from both isis and government forces , and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter . '' tit-for-tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides . isis ' use of children : propaganda and military training . during the tikrit operation , both prime minister al abadi and hadi al ameri of the badr organization have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected . only when the city is taken , will we know whether their appeals were heeded . harmer says he believes a majority of iraqis want to see their country survive ; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war . but it remains a possibility . one of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the shiite militia and sunni tribal brigades into the iraqi security forces , rather than have them operate as independent armies . they are meant to constitute a new national guard , but the mechanics and timing remain problematic . the leaders of these militia have tasted power ; their men have shed blood . they are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when isis are beaten . and they wo n't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come . cnn 's ben wedeman and kareem khadder contributed to this story .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i like to think i 'm a pretty optimistic person . even at dark moments for this country -- after 9/11 or hurricane katrina , for example -- my tendency is always to scout out the sliver of hope for future progress . but i 've got to be honest with you , sometimes that optimism only goes so far . the morning after the 2004 election , when voters in 11 states passed constitutional bans on marriage equality , i never thought i 'd see committed and loving gay and lesbian couples getting married in my lifetime -- in alabama of all places . what 's more , i certainly never thought that , 50 years after a march for voting rights went from selma to montgomery , that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous african-american couple , tori sisson and shanté wolfe , who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line . they slept on that chilly pavement despite the ravings of chief justice roy moore of the alabama supreme court , who has issued baseless edict after baseless edict urging the state 's probate judges to ignore a federal court ruling -lrb- which supersedes a state ruling -rrb- and to refuse to treat lgbt people equally under the law . even today , more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples . in an interview with cnn 's chris cuomo on thursday , chief justice moore even compared refusing marriage licenses to gay couples to refusing to enforce the 1857 dred scott v. sandford decision -lrb- which upheld the legal status of slaves as property -rrb- . i 'm not a trained lawyer , but the logic seems to be that the refusal to treat people like slaves under the law is similar to the refusal to grant gay and lesbians their equal rights to marry under the law . that logic is not only faulty -lrb- restricting rights is not similar to expanding them -rrb- but offensive . the 13 states that still ban same-sex marriage . many are highlighting the echoes of the past in alabama right now ; of gov. george wallace actually blocking two african-american students from entering the auditorium of the university of alabama as they tried to desegregate the school ; of civil rights battles come and gone . me ? i 'm focused on the future . in just a few months , the u.s. supreme court could end this chapter of our history once and for all . even with alabama entering the marriage equality column , there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights . that 's why this spring , the supreme court will hear a case that will determine whether the u.s. constitution can tolerate that kind of discrimination . federal judge : alabama judges must issue gay marriage licenses . we 've all got to raise our voices in support of couples like tori and shanté . but , after bush v. gore , citizens united , and shelby v. holder , the case gutting the 1965 voting rights act in 2013 , sometimes it seems like the voices of the american people do n't get heard by those nine justices . that 's why i 'm so inspired and excited about a new idea from the human rights campaign and robbie kaplan , the lawyer who represented edie windsor in the case that famously struck down the defense of marriage act . together , they 've launched the people 's brief . the idea behind the people 's brief is an original twist on the legal concept of the `` amicus curiae '' -lrb- latin for `` friend of the court . '' -rrb- the legal system allows those who are not party to a case , but who have interests in the case , or information relevant to it , to submit their opinions , information , or testimony on the matter at hand . it 's a way of guaranteeing that the court is not missing any relevant facts or opinions just because those who hold them are not parties to the litigation . the people 's brief marks the first time that the american people -- the 58 % of americans who support marriage equality , anyway -- can make their voices heard in an official brief to those justices . the people 's brief will serve as a poignant reminder to the court that gay marriage is an issue that impacts the lives of both gay and straight , of those who are the family , friends , and loved ones of gay people , and of those who simply value a society where the rights of all people are treated with equal dignity . by going to www.thepeoplesbrief.com , you can sign your name , review the brief -- and it 'll be bundled up with thousands of others and sent to those nine justices for review . the number of people who sign the people 's brief will make that point in a way that no legal argument could . in past civil rights struggles , such as the one that took place half a century ago in selma , alabama , well-intentioned people far from the fray had no easy way to express their support . now modern technology is being harnessed in a creative way to allow people to do just that in the struggle for marriage equality . i think that 's pretty forward-thinking for a court that still does n't allow cameras or online case filings . in fact , i think it 's long overdue . i 've signed my name to the people 's brief , and i hope americans from all backgrounds will do the same or just try to learn more about marriage equality . no one said progress is easy , but true social change is worth fighting for . today , i 'm optimistic that if change can come to alabama , there is no reason why it ca n't come to all 50 states . fair-minded folks should n't be silent at this moment . it 's time to put your name on the right side of history . lend your voice to a chorus too large to be ignored .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- japan 's maritime self-defense force -lrb- msdf -rrb- has taken delivery of the izumo , the largest japanese military vessel to see service since world war ii . the warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the yokusuka naval base near yokohama , also home to the u.s navy 's seventh fleet . the izumo has a crew of 470 , and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones -lrb- 24,000 tonnes at full load , according to military publication jane 's -rrb- , it is as large as the storied yamato-class battleships which fought u.s. naval forces in the pacific theater of world war ii . the wreck of one of the two yamato-class battleships , the musashi , was discovered early in march 2015 by microsoft co-founder paul allen . at 241 meters -lrb- 791 feet -rrb- in length , the izumo is 51 meters -lrb- 167 ft -rrb- longer than the hyuga , another helicopter carrier which was , until now , the mdsf 's largest vessel . regional neighbors and rivals questioned the legitimacy of such a ship for purely defensive purposes , pointing out that , due to its size and deck configuration it could be repurposed as an aircraft carrier -- a class banned under japan 's pacifist constitution . `` the izumo proves that japan has the technical capabilities and demand to develop aircraft carriers . it 's also possible that japan may explore the possibility during the izumo 's service , '' li jie , a beijing-based military expert , told the chinese state-backed global times newspaper . however , defense minister gen nakatani told reporters in yokohama that the msdf did not intend to use it in this way . `` we are not thinking about using this as an aircraft carrier , '' he said , saying that the lack of hangers and service bays , along with a deck unsuitable for takeoffs and landings , meant that the izumo was n't designed for fixed-wing aircraft . he said that it needed to be as large as it is so it could host joint operations and act as a command center . he insisted that the new addition to japan 's maritime forces was designed for peaceful purposes . `` the vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including peacekeeping operations , international disaster relief and aid . '' he added that its helicopter capabilities -- it can host seven anti-submarine patrol helicopters , plus two rescue and transport helicopters , the japan times reported -- would aid in the detection of sophisticated chinese submarines . japan , along with the philippines and vietnam , is engaged in territorial disputes with china over the sovereignty of islands in the south china sea , and kazuhisa ogawa , a defense analyst at the strategic research institute of international change in japan , says that , in combination with japan 's other helicopter carriers , the izumo could be used to `` regain remote islets . '' he also downplayed china 's suggestions that the size of the izumo represented an escalation of japan 's military ambitions , telling cnn that although it is the biggest japanese military ship since world war ii , it is only a fifth of the size of the uss george washington . `` it would cost five times japan 's current defense spending for the sdf to have an independent operational capability . the japanese public would not take that kind of risk , '' he said . the commissioning of the izumo comes amid heightened tensions between japan and its neighbors china and south korea . in july . japanese prime minister shinzo abe allowed for a reinterpreting of japan 's constitution , paving the way for more active military engagement overseas . the chinese government has also invited the japanese leader to attend a ceremony in the chinese capital in september to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war . japan 's handling of its wartime aggression is frequently criticized by china and other asian nations -- it is often accused of downplaying its actions during the war . chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said tuesday that the chinese government had contacted `` all relevant countries '' with a view to attending . the japanese yomiuri shimbun newspaper said that , as the celebrations will feature a military parade , abe is `` unlikely to attend .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- england footballer adam johnson has been suspended by his club sunderland until a police investigation has been completed , the press association reported monday . sunderland 's statement made no mention of why johnson had been arrested , but earlier on monday , a northeast england police force confirmed a 27-year-old man was in custody `` on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16 , '' though durham constabulary would not confirm if the individual in question was the sunderland player . `` he remains in police custody and is helping officers with their inquiries , '' added the statement , referring to the 27-year-old man . `` sunderland afc has confirmed that adam johnson has been suspended from the club , pending the outcome of a police investigation . no further comment will be made at the present time , '' the club told the press association . english premier league club sunderland refused to comment when contacted by cnn over the arrest of the 27-year-old johnson . the last of his 12 international appearances for the senior england team was in august 2012 . he started his career with sunderland 's local rival middlesbrough , making his debut at the age of 17 , and was sold to manchester city for a reported fee of # 7 million -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- in early 2010 . johnson helped city to win the 2011-12 premier league title but was bought by his hometown team sunderland for a reported # 10 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- at the start of the following season .
manila -lrb- cnn -rrb- forty years ago , one of the greatest boxing matches in history took place in an unlikely setting : the capital of the philippines . muhammad ali 's epic win over great rival joe frazier in 1975 became known as the `` thrilla in manila . '' four decades later , and a crowd is gathered at the same venue in this sweating , sprawling city -- known as the araneta coliseum -- for a very different contest : a basketball game between two of the country 's pro teams . and yet , the coliseum can not seem to escape its boxing legacy . the most famous athlete on court today just happens to be a boxer . manny `` the pacman '' pacquiao is the coach , as well as one of the shortest players on the roster at just five foot , six inches -lrb- 168cm -rrb- tall , of team kia carnival . but the filipino is best known around the world as one of the greatest boxers of his generation , the first fighter to win championship belts in eight different weight divisions . but despite his on-court distraction , he 's not finished in the ring . pacquiao is little more than two months away from the most highly anticipated battle of his career . on may 2 , he will finally go toe to toe with american welterweight boxing champion floyd mayweather jr. in las vegas -- the fight most boxing fans have wanted to see for years . but for today , he seems more concerned that kia carnival trails several points behind the talk 'n text tropang texters . in the locker room , pacquiao , who only played for a few unremarkable minutes in the second quarter , gives a short half-time speech to fire up his players . he speaks mostly in tagalog , the main language of the philippines , peppering his locker room speech with english expressions like `` offense '' and `` man-to-man defense . '' seemingly inspired , the team charges back on court shortly after . surprisingly , pacquiao says he gets more nervous on the basketball court than when he faces a barrage of punches in the ring . `` my hands -lsb- get -rsb- cold ! '' he says with a laugh , while rubbing both hands together in the air . `` i believe in my heart that my second sport is basketball , '' he says later , explaining that it is a vital part of his cross-training for boxing . but he adds that he 's choosing to spend fewer minutes playing in professional basketball games these days to avoid injuries ahead of the mayweather showdown . `` i can say -lsb- this will be -rsb- one of the most important fights in my career , '' pacquiao says , during an exclusive interview with cnn . we speak at his cavernous home in a wealthy , gated community in manila . he is dressed in shorts , flip-flops and a red nike t-shirt with his photo on it accompanied by the slogan `` spirit . soul . body . '' a diamond-crusted gold watch glitters on his wrist . several giant paintings bearing quotations from the old testament decorate the walls . the mayweather fight `` has been five years in the making , '' he says . `` and finally it 's happening . i think the fans deserve it . '' in fact , if it was n't for a chance encounter at another basketball game , the mayweather and pacquiao camps may never have agreed to a fight . last january , the two boxers happened to attend the same miami heat game in florida . pacquiao says the meeting in miami gave both sides `` confidence to push '' for the fight . in doing so , the 36 year old says he 's fulfilling the wishes of the two eldest of his five children . `` my son and my daughter , they really wanted this fight to happen , '' he tells us . `` three years ago -lsb- they said -rsb- ` daddy , i want you to fight mayweather . i want you to fight mayweather . ' i said , ` why ? it 's not my fault . he does n't want to fight . ' and now finally now it finally happened . they really , really want to watch the fight . '' of course , the battle in vegas will be much more than the fulfillment of the dreams of fans and pacquiao 's children . there is serious money riding on this fight . it 's estimated that the may 2 bout will break all financial records in the history of professional boxing . the pacman is believed to be earning around $ 80 million for the fight , while mayweather -- who is undefeated -- is expected to earn 20 % more . asked how the whopping paycheck makes him feel , pacquiao replies `` i feel blessed and i owe a lot to the fans . first to god but also the fans because of their support . '' the philippines ' most famous son has come a long way from a childhood mired in poverty and hunger . his rags-to-riches story explains part of the enormous appeal he enjoys in a country where a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line , according to the world bank . `` he is a receptacle of hope , '' says recah trinidad , a veteran columnist at the philippines daily inquirer . `` everybody believes manny should win . they are joyful because they see themselves in manny , because manny comes from deep , deep down in the soil , '' trinidad adds . as a boy pacquiao eked out a living selling donuts in the street , recalls his childhood friend and member of his corner , buboy fernandez . the two were neighbors in general santos city , a city on the southern island of mindanao . it was there that pacquiao was introduced to boxing . as a teenager , he earned extra money to feed his family by battling in underground boxing fights . `` i remember when i started boxing , i earned two dollars , only two dollars , '' pacquiao recalls . he says two of his friends died competing in these unofficial bouts . now a multi-millionaire and superstar , pacquiao says he and his wife are trying to teach their children to appreciate the life of comfort they now enjoy . to prove the point , he says he transferred his children from an academy for international students to a school with no air conditioning . `` i want them to experience , so they can meet hungry families , '' he says . `` so they will not mistreat other people or treat other people different , '' he adds , making a slapping gesture . when pacquiao travels through the perpetually grid-locked traffic of manila , he moves in a black armored escalade with the license plate `` 8 '' on the front . a pair of motorcycle cops escort his convoy . his gym , located in the working class neighborhood of sampaloc , is decorated with huge posters of the champion , as well as an undeniably cute cartoon statue of the goateed fighter that could be described as `` pacman junior . '' cameras from more than a dozen filipino television crews click and whir as pacquiao spars in the ring for an hour with fernandez , the stocky trainer who winces when he occasionally takes hits to his round belly . some of the younger neighborhood boxers who have gathered to watch appear to have adopted haircuts and goatees similar to the man whose rapid-fire punches helped earn him the local nickname `` pacific storm . '' but fernandez says pacquiao has n't started the most intense period of his training yet . this will begin in the next few days when team pacquiao flies to los angeles to work with freddie roach , the american coach who helped the filipino achieve global stardom over the last decade . `` my relationship to freddie roach is amazing , '' pacquiao says . `` since i met him , that was in 2001 , and until now , i did n't change my trainer because we understand each other . we communicate . '' but roach will not be available to work with pacquiao until after march because he is in china training another boxer . as for pacquiao , he has at least one more professional basketball game to coach in manila before he flies to the u.s. . since his rise to superstardom , pacquiao 's activities and interests have multiplied . in addition to basketball and scuba diving off the beaches of mindanao , he has dabbled in singing , acting and politics . several years ago , he won an election to a seat in the national congress . pacquiao proudly points to legislation he says he helped pass aimed at curbing the scourge of human trafficking in the philippines . but one local newspaper has also highlighted that paqcuiao has one of the lowest attendance rates in the entire legislative body , pointing out that the boxer could boast more championship belts than days physically spent in congress . pacquiao insists that instead of networking in the capital , he focuses on helping poor people in his electoral district . `` if you compare my accomplishments to other congressmen , i think i did a lot , '' he says . some critics argue pacquiao 's boxing has suffered due to his many other distractions . `` he 's spreading himself thin , '' says recah trinidad , the newspaper columnist . trinidad points to pacquiao 's knock-out at the hands of juan manuel marquez in 2012 . `` i hope manny could win -lsb- on may 2 -rsb- , i 've been praying , '' trinidad says . but the journalist fears pacquiao may not be able to break through mayweather 's much-vaunted defense . `` he 's got to adopt a more mature style of boxing . he can not rely on what we call an explosive , kamikaze style , '' trinidad tells cnn . back on court at the araneta coliseum , pacquiao 's kia carnival still trails by several points . but they soon manage to pick up some momentum and for the first time , take the lead . the boxer stalks the sidelines , watching closely , exchanging high-fives when his players come on and off the court . when the final horn sounds , pacquiao 's underdogs have beaten their better-ranked opponents -- an upset unlikely to be lost on him as he plots his own success against a more fancied opponent in the ring .
jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- a newly released isis video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an israeli spy . the video identifies the man as 19-year-old mohamed said ismail musallam , an israeli citizen of palestinian descent . in the video , isis shows musallam 's israeli passport and claims he 's an agent sent to infiltrate the group . the 19-year-old 's family told cnn tuesday that he had no ties with the mossad , israel 's spy agency , and had , in fact , been recruited by isis . `` mohamed told me and his brother that isis took him , '' according to said musallam , his father . `` they sent him money through the western union . they said you will have girls , money , cars , villas , paradise , but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing . '' it was n't long before musallam 's family members did n't recognize him when they talked to him on skype . the man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle . his father tried to help him get home , sending him money and even enlisting the red cross . but his son never made it back to israel . about a month ago , said musallam said , he was told his son was taken by isis when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border . a video posted tuesday on isis-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be musallam on his knees , wearing an orange jumpsuit . an adult isis fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him . the adult , speaking french , gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing . the child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots musallam in the forehead . the man immediately falls forward to the ground . the child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body . ahmad musallam said he 'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death . `` i used to take care of him and babysit him when mom went to work , '' he said , crying . `` mohamed is not a brother . he is a son . '' but he refuses to show the video to his parents , who still ca n't believe their son is dead . an issue last month of isis ' english-language propaganda magazine , dabiq , included a purported interview with musallam and described his alleged work for the israeli spy agency . in the isis video , musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession , saying he is an israeli intelligence agent working for mossad , sent to infiltrate isis . musallam 's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video , forced to lie about ties to israeli intelligence . `` mohamed is not an agent . mohamed does n't have a shekel . if he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life , '' his mother , hind musallam , said . `` we could have been living a different life and i would not be working cleaning houses so we can live . '' this is n't the first time isis has used children to drive home its message . an isis propaganda video released in january -- one that cnn could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head . the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high . last august , a photo posted to twitter from an isis stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , `` that 's my boy . '' isis has featured children as fighters before , calling them the `` cubs of the caliphate '' -lrb- the adult jihadis call each other `` lions '' -rrb- and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families . it has taken over schools to indoctrinate children . human rights watch says isis and other extremist groups `` have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- mention the words `` sand '' and `` golf '' together , and the chances are you 'll leave many players shuddering at the memory of being trapped in bunkers after another wayward shot . but in other parts of the world , sand golf is a version of the game in its own right . the idea of playing a round without verdant fairways to stride down or lush greens to putt -lrb- and , of course , miss -rrb- on seems strange , even wrong . sometimes needs must , though . half a century ago , expat oil workers with an enthusiasm for golf had nowhere in abu dhabi to play . in the baking desert heat , with little or no irrigation possible , the equation was simple : they either had to adapt to the surroundings or there 'd be no golf at all . the result was an incarnation of the game in which the only grass to be seen is artificial , found on a mat carried around by players to serve both as a tee and a surface from which to strike when the ball is on the fairway . fairways ? they consist entirely of sand and are indicated by marker posts . if the ball lands outside them , it 's in the sand golf equivalent of the rough -- stony terrain that the unwary player may soon find is home to a few snakes and a lizard or two . greens ? well , they 're known as `` browns , '' built from clay and topped with a mixture of sand and oil to provide a true putting surface , a formula arrived at through trial and error . it 's an odd environment , this golfing world with a palette of golden-brown colors . and with rapidly developing irrigation and growing techniques enabling grass courses to be built in desert climes , it 's an increasingly unusual one . back in 1961 , determined british oil workers created a sand course on an atoll known as das island , around 100 miles off abu dhabi in the persian gulf . it was the country 's first-ever golf club . as the expat population grew , so did the demand for the game , and in 1971 sand golf moved into abu dhabi proper with the opening of a course near the sea palace . its success brought a move to the equestrian club , attracting close to 500 members . in the 1990s , the sand game 's fortunes took a dive as the site was earmarked for a nine-hole grass course . but although many sand course players changed surface and took up the more conventional game , several battled on and the 18-hole al ghazal sand course was created near abu dhabi airport , with its front nine occupying part of an archaeological site , in 1997 . sand golf also exists in parts australia and africa but al ghazal -lrb- which translates as `` gazelle '' -- gazelles peer from behind a fence by the second brown , -rrb- is the only one that can be described as `` world class , '' says dennis cox , an expert on the game , because the scale and scope of its layout rivals its grass counterparts . the course found a place in the international spotlight when a world sand golf championship , boasting star names including colin montgomerie was played in 2004 and 2005 -lrb- won by greg owen and thongchai jaidee , -rrb- but the tournament fizzled out as showpiece events went to showpiece grass courses . maybe that 's understandable when you consider some of the extra elements involved in the sand game -- the browns , for example , must be swept for a few minutes after use so that they are left smooth and footprint-less for following players , while unexpected hazards can include burrows dug by desert lizards . cox warns that a tradition is under threat , with a form of golf that was once commonplace in danger of becoming just a memory . other , smaller clubs have fallen by the wayside , while al ghazal 's location near an expanding airport presents an obvious threat to its future . but even if the sand game were to fade into obscurity in the emirate , it is still played in parts of africa . in libya , still racked by instability following the ousting of muammar gaddaffi , courses -- the bulk of which can be found in the capital , tripoli -- are of sand , with no grass versions existing . once smart and well-kept , they have now slumped into neglect , with few people to play on them or look after them . david bachmann , who formerly worked at the austrian embassy in the city , wrote on his in tripolis blog about the experience of playing sand golf in and near the city . recounting his experiences of tripoli 's tattered nine-hole ghargharesh course , he wrote that it was one for diehards only , `` golf fanatics that would come every weekend to play a round on this challenging course . '' and he imagined that the skeleton of the clubhouse , on which work had long since stopped , might one day boast `` marble , chandeliers and state-of-the-art locker rooms ... overlooking the deep blue mediterranean with the sun setting over the sea . '' for now , and against the odds , fans of this form of the game will just have to make do with being kings of their very own sand castles .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- chelsea 's good week continued when the blues beat west ham 1-0 in the english premier league to maintain a five-point lead over manchester city atop the table . chelsea manager jose mourinho -- who picked up another trophy sunday in the league cup final -- had never lost to west ham in the top flight and belgian attacker eden hazard ensured three more points when he netted in the first half wednesday at the hammers ' upton park . `` the game was very difficult , '' hazard told sky . `` one big battle against a good team with very good players . `` it 's always difficult when you do n't score the second goal to kill the game . but one goal was enough . it 's not always like this . `` the goalkeeper , the defense we have are very strong . it was very good . '' chelsea keeper thibaut courtois made a string of good saves in the second half but west ham boss sam allardyce lamented his team 's finishing -- plus the refereeing . he felt hazard 's goal was offside . `` when you look back on the season and they say these things even themselves out , that 's the biggest load of rubbish i 've ever heard , '' the under pressure allardyce told sky . nigel pearson , manager of last-place leicester , also felt aggrieved after his team lost 2-0 to reigning league champion manchester city . leicester did n't get a penalty when city striker wilfried bony appeared to foul jeff schlupp in the box in the first half or when fernando fouled andrej kramaric in the second . leicester struck the woodwork , too . city -- reeling following back-to-back defeats to barcelona in the champions league and liverpool -- only really came to life after david silva 's opener in first-half stoppage time . leicester 's veteran keeper mark schwarzer thwarted city to keep it close but could do little on james milner 's 88th-minute effort . the win was `` very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against liverpool and barcelona , '' said city manager manuel pellegrini , who rested club captain vincent kompany . elsewhere , four teams vying for champions league spots all won . manchester united claimed all three points at newcastle when ashley young took advantage of keeper tim krul 's error in the 89th minute ; arsenal doubled third-last qpr 2-1 ; surging liverpool shut out second-last burnley 2-0 ; and league cup finalist tottenham defeated swansea 3-2 in a game overshadowed by french striker bafetimbi gomis collapsing to the turf . united defender jonny evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at st. james ' park , since he appeared to spit in striker papiss cisse 's direction when they clashed in the first half . cisse then appeared to spit back at evans . arsenal remained third , with united in fourth on 53 points , two better than liverpool , four better than southampton and six better than spurs , who have a game in hand . in wednesday 's other match , stoke extended everton 's league slide by blanking the toffees 2-0 at home . barcelona reaches copa del rey final . in spain , meanwhile , barcelona reached the copa del rey final by easing past villarreal 6-2 on aggregate . holding a 3-1 lead after the first leg , barcelona won away by the same score wednesday , helped by neymar 's double . barcelona faces familiar foe athletic bilbao in may 's finale . bilbao advanced 3-1 on aggregate over espanyol , prevailing in the second leg 2-0 . barcelona topped bilbao in the 2009 and 2011 finals .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- from the sweltering heat of the sahara desert to the subzero temperatures at both north and south poles , fiona oakes ' running obsession knows no bounds . dubbed the `` queen of the extreme , '' the record-breaking runner has completed more than 50 marathons and ultramarathons , but she remains determinedly modest about her feats . `` i do n't keep my medals , i do n't know where they are . i do n't have trophies -- people have cabinets of trophies -- the dogs have chewed most of mine , '' oakes told cnn 's human to hero series . `` i do n't have cuttings from newspapers ... i 'm not interested . i would never say to people : ' i am this ' or ' i am that ' -- it 's not something that i 'm predisposed to shout about . i do n't think i 'm very special at all , to be honest . '' perhaps the 48-year-old needs to rethink her definition of special given her punishing schedule is religiously maintained despite her suffering from a potentially crippling knee complaint -- a legacy of reconstructive surgery during her teens . `` i had a tumor -lrb- in my right knee -rrb- when i was 14 years old , it was n't discovered until i was 17 , by which time i had lost an awful lot of weight -- i think i weighed around five stone , '' she explains . `` in the end i had radical surgery to remove the kneecap and knee joint . it was in plaster for about three years . i was told that i would n't walk properly again , let alone do anything like running . it 's painful when i run , but i can manage it because i know what to expect . '' oakes started running properly just over a decade ago and soon found her stride , winning her first half-marathon in a course-record time before stepping up to compete over 26.2 miles and beyond . today , she routinely finishes conventional marathons in around two hours , 50 minutes and has a personal best of two hours , 38 minutes -- a shade over the a standard required to qualify for the 2012 olympic games . when she 's not pounding the tarmac in city marathons , oakes competes in some of the world 's toughest endurance races counting the volcano marathon in chile 's atacama desert -- an 150-mile ultramarathon run at altitudes in excess of 4,400 meters -lrb- 14,600 feet -rrb- -- and the similarly challenging marathon des sables where competitors run six marathons in six days through the sahara desert among her conquests . she still winces at the memory of competing in that 154-mile saraha event , dubbed the world 's toughest footrace . `` the marathon des sables in 2012 was appallingly tough . the week before i went i broke two toes -- a horse stood on my foot . `` trying to complete the marathon des sables is a tough ask , but trying to complete it with broken toes was brutal . for the whole week i lived on painkillers ... it was just appalling , but it did toughen me up , '' she says . the following year , oakes broke three world records becoming the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent -- clocking an aggregate time of 26 hours , 18 minutes and 43 seconds -- as well as recording the fastest aggregate and elapsed times for running marathons on all seven continents plus the north pole -- a place she remembers warmly . `` i think my favorite marathon has to be the north pole , purely because it 's a marathon on the top of the world . it 's such an unrealistic place to be actually running a marathon , and also i caught a glimpse of a polar bear -- which has to be one of the highlights of my life . '' there is no let up in her schedule when she 's crosses the finish line -- once she 's got her breath back it 's straight back to the day job running an animal sanctuary at her home in asheldham , essex . with 400 animals including horses , pigs , sheep and dogs to care for around the clock as well as keeping up her training routine of 100 miles every week , it 's no surprise that oakes has little time for anything else . `` my life is very , very regimented , it 's hard to fit in the running around caring for the animals . i have to get up at 3.30 in the morning and i work through till probably nine or 10 o'clock at night , '' she says . `` people forget that if you train for something very , very hard it has a detrimental effect on the people around you . i have no personal or family life . every minute of my time that is not spent caring for my animals is spent dedicated to running . `` it might be that whenever someone else is having a christmas day lunch , i 'm putting my running shoes and going out to run 30 miles . '' running has helped her raise money for the animal sanctuary and also allowed her to promote a positive image of veganism , though oakes , who has n't eaten animal products since her teenage years , is keen not to sound too preachy . `` i do n't like to dwell on the vegan thing because -lrb- you -rrb- quickly gets marked as some sort of fruitcake or an animal rights extremist and i do n't want to appear to be telling people what to do -- it 's a personal thing , '' she says . but she can not deny feeling a deep sense of satisfaction about helping change the perception that vegans somehow lack energy because of their diet . `` i became so frustrated by constantly being told you ca n't do -lrb- running -rrb- as a vegan -lrb- and that -rrb- vegans are weak , vegans will keel over if they try to do something extreme . i wanted to prove my point . `` i just want to be an example to say that if these people are considering this lifestyle , it can be done on a plant-based diet . '' as if to hammer home her point , oakes recently attempted to run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents -- running in a `` cow costume '' to raise awareness of animal cruelty . her hopes of completing the triple 7 quest were dashed at the last though when poor weather prevented her flying from chile to antarctica to complete the final leg of the race . `` it was really devastating at the finish , but i could n't wait , i had to come home for the animals . i 'm not at an extendable budget with time so i had to leave , '' she said . next month , oakes will be off on her travels again , returning to morocco to compete in her third marathon des sables , before heading back onto the road to compete at the berlin marathon later in the year where she aims to better her 17th-place finish achieved in 2006 . `` i 'm always focusing on what i 'm about to do next , '' she says , before quietly conceding running is n't always her favorite activity . `` i do n't particularly enjoy running . the training is extremely difficult and i do push to the absolute limits . i enjoy the results that are achieved from the running ... i like to take on challenges that would be almost impossible and prove that i can do it . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- if it were easy , any company or government could do it . but flying an ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive , and everyone safe -- is complicated . probably no one knows that better than phoenix air , a georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting ebola victims by air . since august , it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to europe , the rest to the united states . `` we 're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse . the bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway , '' said dent thompson , vice president and chief operations officer at phoenix air . he described the system that goes inside the company 's modified gulfstream g-iii aircraft . it consists of three major elements : . once the plane has landed and the patient has left , the whole system is sealed . the aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in cartersville , georgia , where it undergoes a complete decontamination process , which can take up to 24 hours . everything inside the liner , including the liner , is sterilized multiple times . the liner and everything in it is then removed , put in special boxes , and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed . `` we like to say it 's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we 're done with it , '' thompson said . phoenix air began developing its system way before the current ebola outbreak . it worked with the department of defense and the centers for disease control and prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases . then , the main concerns were sars , swine and bird flu . it took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved , and by the time the work was done , the need had sort of petered out . but thompson said phoenix air held onto the system , knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again . he got a call from the state department in july . by august , the company had completed its first ebola flight , safely delivering dr. kent brantly to emory university hospital in atlanta . a few days later , it brought nancy writebol to the same hospital for treatment . and on and on and on . thompson said other groups are now developing systems similar to phoenix air 's , including the u.s. government . but so far , none has flown . `` other organizations have built systems , but we 're the ones still doing it , '' he said . more than 10,000 people have died in the ebola outbreak , mostly in the countries of guinea , liberia and sierra leone .

'' negotiators have set tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal . a comprehensive deal , including technical additions , is supposed to be negotiated by june 30 . world powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years . in exchange , iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy . kerry 's comments to cnn came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in lausanne , switzerland , made headlines . the assertion : iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb . on sunday , an iranian negotiator told journalists that tehran would not send fissile material to russia , which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb-making materials out of reach . `` the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to send them abroad . ... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , '' iranian deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi said . but on monday , a senior u.s. state department official said the rumblings in the press should quiet down . negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material , and iran has made the comments many times before , the official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports . chinese foreign minister wang yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks ' progress earlier monday , saying that the diplomats were `` narrowing down '' their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points . `` these marathon-like negotiations have reached the final stage , '' he said . things have been tense in lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms , with talks snagged on three important points : . • how quickly or slowly iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement . • how quickly crushing u.n. sanctions will go away . • whether sanctions will snap back into place if iran violates the deal . iran wants them gone for good . but international negotiators want merely to suspend them , so they can reapply them as leverage if iran does not keep the bargain . agreement on the points is crucial , a western diplomat said . `` there can not be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions , '' the diplomat said . in the background , a vocal critic of a possible deal spoke out again . over the weekend , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu denounced the deal he believes is taking shape . `` this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse , '' he said after a meeting in israel with visiting u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell . netanyahu also attacked iran for its support of houthi rebels in yemen , who have overtaken many parts of that country . he said iran was trying to take over the whole middle east with the nuclear deal and its influence in yemen . conservative washington lawmakers are threatening new sanctions if tehran does n't comply with demands , which could throw a wrench into negotiations . u.s. negotiators are working to reach an agreement in part to prevent this kind of congressional punishment . they fear it could prompt hardliners in tehran to push for killing the talks , which would scuttle the chances of a deal altogether . aside from the three tough points , negotiators on both sides have shown optimism . u.s. officials have said most of the other elements were solvable if those three major hurdles could be overcome . iran 's araghchi agreed . `` getting to an accord is doable . solutions have been found for numerous questions , '' he said . iran would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed . but diplomats says it 's not so simple . iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , but sanctions adopted by the united nations are more complicated . many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the u.n. nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , that iran 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension . on saturday , iranian foreign minister javad zarif showed some optimism about finding a path through the deadlock . he said he believes the world powers `` have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together . it 's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating . '' u.s. officials said that all sides , including iran , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as iran confirms its compliance to the deal . but they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula . iran also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect . new machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machines . u.s. and european officials worry that could enable iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon . diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15-year deal would have the most stringent restrictions , which would be relaxed over the last five . `` we are not asking them to do nothing -lrb- in technology development -rrb- , but they want to do more than we want them to do , '' a western diplomat said . but the diplomat added , `` after 15 years , they can do what they want . '' diplomats said iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium . that figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started thursday , but substantially more than the several hundred the united states had originally wanted . iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges , but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile . u.s. officials maintain the number is not that important , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges iran can operate , which they believe will extend the time iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- known as the `` breakout time '' -- to at least a year . while the focus this week is on the march 31 deadline , it 's important to note it is n't the final deadline . even if a pact is reached tuesday , it 's unclear what form it would take , and the united states and iran have varying needs . the parties are seeking to reach what 's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal . but if they 're able to come together on the big issues , they still have until the end of june when the joint plan of action expires to iron out the details . so that means the talks wo n't be finished this month . officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders . the united states would prefer a written accord , but iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached . u.s. officials say they will need to quantify iran 's commitments before submitting the agreement to congress . but u.s. and western diplomats say that iran is looking simply for an `` understanding '' of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached . cnn 's jim sciutto , nimet kirac and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- prince charles and his wife , camilla , duchess of cornwall , are to spend the next four days in the united states , visiting the nation 's capital and louisville , kentucky . the couple arrived in washington on tuesday evening . many people will remember charles from the day in july 1981 when , as a dashing young prince , he kissed his shy bride , diana , on the balcony of buckingham palace in front of the eyes of the world . but many things have changed since then , including their divorce , diana 's death in a car accident in 1997 and his marriage to camilla , now duchess of cornwall . here are five things to know about the prince of wales : . while a lot of attention in recent years has been focused on his sons , princes william and harry , charles is next in line to the british throne . his mother , queen elizabeth ii , has ruled for more than 60 years -lrb- in fact , in september she is expected to overtake her great-great-grandmother queen victoria for the title of britain 's longest-reigning monarch . -rrb- . her longevity is welcomed by her subjects , but it means that charles , at age 66 , has spent a long time as a monarch-in-waiting . he 's also now a grandfather , thanks to the birth of prince george in 2013 . charles and camilla tied the knot on april 9 , 2005 . the couple first visited the united states together as newlyweds , and camilla was confronted by hard-core princess diana fans with abusive placards . polls at the time found that between 57 % and 73 % of brits opposed charles ' new wife being known as queen . if you go back even further , to 1997 , the year diana died , an ipsos mori poll put it at 86 % . but there 's been a change in sentiment since they married . a new poll conducted by comres for cnn found that only 35 % now oppose camilla being known as queen . nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago . in an exclusive interview with cnn royal correspondent max foster , charles opened up about the couple 's relationship . he met camilla years before he wed diana , who famously said in a 1995 bbc tv interview that `` there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded . '' reporter 's notebook : interviewing the royal couple . the prince has admitted talking to his plants in past tv interviews , inviting ridicule from some quarters . but as part of his interest in sustainability , he has championed organic farming and gardening for many years , including on his large country estates . he has a fully functioning organic farm at highgrove estate in gloucestershire , england , and founded his own organic food brand , duchy originals , which now turns a healthy profit and helps fund his charitable foundation . according to his official website , he 's an advocate of traditional rural skills and enjoys hedge laying . charles has riled some people over the years with his outspoken views on architecture , which prioritize the traditional over the modern . in 1984 , he made headlines when he described a proposed modern extension to the national gallery in london as `` a monstrous carbuncle , '' according to news reports from the time . he 's also invited controversy by reportedly writing to ministers -- and even the prime minister -- on subjects close to his heart . this intervention in the public sphere has troubled those who believe the royals should not get involved in such debates and worry that , once king , charles may not remain above politics in the way that his mother has . in a piece published by the architectural review in december , charles explained his thinking on architecture , saying `` designing places according to the human scale and with nature at the heart of the process has always been my central concern . '' the future king has often been photographed on the ski slopes of europe and in the past has also tried his hand at water skiing , surfing and scuba diving . he was a keen polo player for more than four decades , only retiring from the sport in 2005 . this is despite breaking his arm in two places when he fell off a pony during a polo match in 1990 . he also climbed in the saddle as a jockey on a number of occasions . his website also describes him as an `` experienced watercolourist '' who likes to paint in the open air at home and on his travels .
baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- joint iraqi forces now have control of tikrit military hospital as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from isis . the joint forces raised the iraqi flag from the hospital premises wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides , the hashd al-shaabi paramilitary force said . the predominantly shia militia has been working with iraqi troops as well as sunni fighters to try to regain tikrit from isis . the hospital is a few blocks south of the presidential palace . tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isis , which has captured large areas of iraq and syria for what it says is its islamic caliphate . on march 1 , iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salahuddin province . isis was n't making it easy , however . the sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near tikrit , preventing the joint iraqi forces from using it to cross the tigris river to approach the city from the east . nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing isis fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions , hashd al-shaabi 's media office said . there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014 . if iraq regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible . the tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters . also assisting is iran , which has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraqi government . according to the pentagon , iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well . gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff , told a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee on wednesday that the consensus was that iran 's involvement was positive in military terms . `` anything anyone does to counter isis is in the main a good outcome , '' he said . but at the same time , dempsey said , the united states is concerned about what role iran might seek in the longer term once isis is defeated . while iraqi forces piled the pressure on isis in tikrit , the sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in iraq 's western anbar province . isis launched a new offensive on the city of ramadi , west of baghdad , on wednesday morning , faleh al-issawi , the deputy head of the anbar provincial council , said in a statement . the city is being attacked `` from all directions , '' with isis firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets toward it , he said . some 17 explosives-laden vehicles have been detonated at various security checkpoints and in the city center , he said . one vehicle targeted a bridge that provides access to the city from the north . this is `` the fiercest attack by isis '' seen on ramadi , al-issawi said . iraqi forces have imposed a curfew on the city . al-issawi said the iraqi air force was urgently needed . `` we need air cover to repel these attacks but did not see the iraqi air force do anything -- we only saw one airstrike by the coalition hitting one target , '' he said . officials believe `` this is an isis response to the tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north , '' he added . he said there had been 10 casualties among iraqi forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured . in the 24 hours from tuesday to wednesday morning , there were 13 airstrikes in iraq and two in syria , the u.s.-led coalition against isis said in a statement . the strikes in iraq were concentrated near mosul , al qaim and falluja . there were none in the tikrit or ramadi areas . elsewhere in anbar province , iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of karma from isis , said sabah al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council . al-karhout , speaking to cnn by telephone , said 80 % of karma , about 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- northeast of falluja , was now under the control of iraqi security forces after a large-scale operation that started tuesday at dawn . dozens of isis militants were killed in clashes with iraqi soldiers , he said . the second phase of the operation is to clear any remnants of the isis force from the town and to remove any mines and bombs left behind . iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with shia hashd al-shaabi units and local tribesmen , al-karhout said . health officials in falluja told cnn that the falluja general hospital received the bodies of 25 isis militants killed in the karma battle . isis is also battling in many places far from tikrit , including syria , where the militant group is more on the offensive , according to the syrian observatory for human rights -lrb- sohr -rrb- , a london-based nongovernmental organization . `` hundreds of isis militants launched a large scale offensive on ras al ayn , a syrian strategic border town with turkey on friday , '' sohr said in a statement wednesday . `` they made some advances there and seized tal khanzir . '' clashes are still ongoing between the kurdish people 's protection units -lrb- kurdish ypg -rrb- and isis fighters , with dozens killed from both sides , sohr said . cnn 's kareem khadder reported from baghdad , and laura smith-spark wrote in london . cnn 's mohammed tawfeeq , jamie crawford and azadeh ansari contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- russian police moved with surprising speed to arrest five suspects , all of them chechens , in the killing of opposition figure boris nemtsov . they tried to arrest a sixth suspect , but he reportedly threw a grenade at the arresting officers and then blew himself up . yet that speed has only raised more questions about who wanted nemtsov dead -- and why ? conspiracy theories are rife , but so far , none seem totally convincing . • the kremlin did it . some members of russia 's opposition -- and nemtsov 's daughter -- are convinced russia 's government was behind nemtsov 's killing . but why ? and why now ? nemtsov , 55 , had been an opposition leader for years and had recently been overshadowed by younger members of the opposition such as alexey navalny . so killing him now does n't seem to make sense . some of nemtsov 's supporters claim he had become a bigger threat to the kremlin , pointing to information he was allegedly uncovering on russia 's military role in ukraine that could undermine the kremlin 's claims that its forces fighting in ukraine have been just `` volunteers . '' but the dramatic staging of the killing -- he was shot in the back on a famous moscow bridge against the backdrop of red square and the kremlin , where putin has his office -- seems a bit too obvious . and how exactly does it help putin to look like a killer ? • the west did it . some russian politicians and media personalities close to the kremlin charge that putin 's foes in the west orchestrated the killing to damage the russian president 's image and ignite a civil war in russia . but why would washington want to destroy someone who was championing democracy and who is friendly to the united states ? -lrb- conspiracy theorists reply : to create a `` sacrificial lamb '' and blame the slaughter on putin . -rrb- . • it was the chechens . here , the plot thickens . the key suspect , zaur dadayev , reportedly initially confessed to being involved with the shooting . but then , russian media reported , he denied involvement . russian officials have alleged that dadayev , a former security officer and fervent muslim , decided to punish nemtsov for supporting the rights of the french charlie hebdo journalists to publish cartoons of the prophet mohammed . but nemtsov 's allies point out that he was not anti-muslim and rarely spoke of the cartoons -- he was by no means a central figure in the cartoon story . to make things more complicated , the strongman leader of chechnya , ramzan kadyrov , praised dadayev as a brave soldier , a religious man and a `` real patriot . '' but on tuesday , putin awarded kadyrov the order of honor , and the chechen leader pledged he would die for putin . a further twist is that chechens reportedly are fighting in ukraine -- on both sides of the battle line -lrb- for the ukrainian government and for the russian-allied separatists . -rrb- that 's led some back to the theory that nemtsov was killed because of his allegedly explosive information on russia 's role in ukraine . • the ukrainians did it . many russians are convinced that what they call the `` fascist '' kiev government would stop at nothing to frame putin . after all , a significant number of people , fed by domestic propaganda , still believe the ukrainian air force shot down malaysian airlines flight 17 over ukraine despite much of the evidence pointing to russian-backed rebels as the culprits . • it was domestic extremists . supporters of this theory are mainly in the opposition camp . they accuse the kremlin of whipping up hatred against the so-called fifth column -- `` traitors '' who are trying to undermine russia from within . photos of opposition leaders labeled `` traitors '' have been posted in russian cities , while at an anti-ukraine rally in moscow just days before nemtsov 's assassination , russians loyal to putin carried signs and placards with pictures of those `` traitors , '' including nemtsov . but whatever the reality of what happened in moscow , high-profile killings in russia , especially ones with a political connection , are rarely solved . chechens were convicted of killing journalist anna politkovskaya , for example , but there still is no explanation of why they did it or who organized the murder . now , with nemtsov 's killing , russian officials and kremlin-friendly media have whipped up a sandstorm of theories , confounding the most intrepid attempts at establishing the truth . will things play out any differently this time ?
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a golfing paradise forged from the ashes of the space race . and , according to owner dave pelz , it might just be the best back garden on the planet . one thing is certain , no self-respecting golfer would emerge from a stint patrolling the perfectly coiffured turf at chez pelz in austin , texas any worse around the greens . `` they say it 's the world 's best backyard , '' one of golf 's most renowned short game coaches , and former nasa employee , told cnn 's living golf show . `` it 's my dream . i have a dream job and i live in my dream house . i live with my dream girl . i 'm a happy guy . '' it 's no wonder pelz is content . his named is etched in the evolution of golf . his students , including five-time major champion phil mickelson , have amassed a combined 20 majors between them and as one of golf 's most fertile brains , pelz has 26 golf patents to his name . the 70-year-old still works with mickelson prior to major tournaments and the player known as `` lefty `` credits pelz with helping to elevate his game to the elite level . `` i was 0-for-43 in majors before i met him , and i 've won four , plus a players championship since , '' mickelson was quoted as saying prior to capturing his fifth major -- the british open -- in 2013 . `` that says it all about him , in my book . '' the septuagenarian pioneered the use of statistics back in the 1970s and 80s , his analysis of the game sculpted by a 15-year stint working for space agency nasa . his insistence on short game practice , and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department , have informed the modern professional 's approach . `` i did space research and golf research on my own time , '' explained the brains behind the two-ball putter , one of the best-selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately . `` nasa has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race . sputnik had just gone up . `` we were trying to catch the russians in terms of space exploration . and i got in a wonderful group of scientists and learned to do honest to god research . '' pelz banked a place at indiana university thanks to a golf scholarship and chose to study physics . he famously played the legendary jack nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18-time major champion on every occasion , but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for nasa . using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists , pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he 'd picked up at the goddard space flight center . and gradually , piece by piece , he began to deconstruct each facet of his game and isolate the improvements he needed to make . `` i started measuring my own putting , '' he said . `` i started measuring my short game . i started measuring my driving . `` i learned how to measure things at goddard space flight center because they had the best instruments in the world and i learned the practical application of the scientific method . `` i finally started understanding my game after 10 years of research . it 's funny to say from a person who went to college for four years on a golf scholarship . `` those thousand lessons that taught me virtually nothing ... they might not have been teaching right but it was also partly i was n't listening and i was n't looking for the things that i needed to look for . `` all of a sudden i qualified again for the u.s. amateur -lrb- america 's leading competition for amateur golfers -rrb- and i 'm not practicing at all like i used to but my game was better . i was a better player . '' despite this spike in quality , pelz was still hesitant when it came to the prospect of throwing his lot in on the pga tour with other professionals . `` i had a serious thinking period , '' he explained . `` and i thought the game really does n't need another good player . `` i believed by now that if i really worked hard i could be a really good player and i might be able to make it on the tour , but i 'd never be the best player in the world . `` i did n't have that kind of practice time in me . at this stage i 'm 35 now and i got so involved in the research of golf , in finding out about my own game , i thought ' i could help a lot of players . ' `` what the world really needs is for somebody to tell them what they 're doing wrong so they can score better and enjoy the game more . `` that 's really what golf is about . it 's really not what you shoot , it 's whether or not you are improving . '' while pelz 's brain power is not in question , his business acumen is -- by his own admission . after taking a year-long leave of absence from goddard and securing funding from a group of friends , he embarked on a journey that would eventually lead to his space age backyard in austin . but it was a bumpy ride to say the least . `` i 'm a terrible businessman to this day , '' he joked . `` i do n't do anything in my company except teach golf and do golf research . my wife is the ceo . she runs the company and makes all the decisions . of that first year in business he recalls : `` i spent all the money and lost every dime . and they said ` well , here 's some more . ' i lost that the second year . `` then they said : ` we 're out . that 's all the money we have . we 're not going throw money down a rat hole . you do n't know what you 're doing in business . ' which is true , i did not . '' however , by this time pelz had hit upon the idea that would help him make an indelible mark on golf -- the importance of the short game . after three years studying players on the pga tour he deduced they were neglecting one of the most important areas of the game -- from 100 yards in . his calculations underlined the short game accounted for as much as 65 % of golf , and also happened to be the one area in which most professionals struggled . most players had a range of clubs that essentially fulfilled the same function -- to hit the ball long distances -- while they relied on just one club to take care of business from 100 yards out or closer . pelz said : `` thirty five years ago nobody even talked about short game -- the term was n't used . it was golf . `` when i was taught golf i was taught that it was a drive and a shot to the green and then you putted . `` but if you ca n't get to the green you ca n't play golf so everybody practices the long game and they did n't even call it the long game . that was just the game . `` but i did my research and i measured how many shots people hit and it turns out everybody does hit the first two shots . `` they hit the ball off the tee , then they hit the ball at the green -- most people miss the green -- then they hit a chip shot or a pitch shot , sometimes it 's not very good and they do another one and then two or three putts . `` so the truth is there are two long shots and three or four or five short game shots every hole and people do n't think about these . they just think it looks like it 's easy to do . `` it is easy to do if you know how to do it but it 's not easy to do right if you do n't know how to do it and you never practice it . `` if all you practice is the long game , practicing that for the rest of your life will not help your short game because they take different swings . they are truly different games . '' pelz 's breakthrough came just at the right time . with money running out he had mortgaged his house , resigned from his role with nasa and was relying on the players he was working with to fund his fledgling start-up . at year five he had reached break even point , and would continue to do so until year 21 , when he finally started making money . by this time his portfolio of players was ever expanding , and grew to include mickelson , widely regarded as one of the finest short game exponents ever . `` i 've worked with over 100 players now on the tour and phil mickelson and everybody says , ` oh he has a natural god-given talent with a short game , '' pelz said . `` no he 's not . he 's very talented but he also works very hard . he has practiced and practiced and tested and experimented . '' the pair still work together , but it is often missed by the mainstream media as they tend to meet two weeks out from a major tournament . pelz is still as enthusiastic about golf as he ever was , especially about the dynamics of the short game and how important it is to keep practicing . while some players will never be able to match the game 's power hitters no matter how hard they train , short game is one area pros and amateurs can make huge strides in . `` i will never hit it as far as rory mcilroy , '' pelz said . `` i ca n't do it . now you give me that kind of -lrb- extensive -rrb- practice and i will kill him in the short game and putting . `` that 's saying a lot because he 's good at short game and putting . he 's not bad but he 's not practicing it 12 hours a day , every day , seven days a week . `` so i 'm saying no matter what you do you 'll never conquer the full power game as much as you can conquer the short game and putting for amateurs . i think there 's a lot of potential for amateurs . `` i want them to focus there and enjoy the game more . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- lionel messi has set the stage for a potentially season-defining week for barcelona , scoring both goals as his team went four points clear at the top of the spanish league on saturday . the 2-0 win at tiny eibar , a side playing in la liga for the first time and which has now lost eight games in a row , may not seem like an unexpected achievement . but , with a european champions league last-16 decider at home to manchester city on wednesday and then the `` el clasico '' crunch clash with bitter rival real madrid next sunday , every win is vital at this stage of the campaign . `` we 're going into the clasico as leaders and in perfect form , '' barca coach luis enrique said . `` but first we have to focus on city because qualification is at stake . then we 'll see what happens at the weekend . '' messi has now scored 43 goals this season , first netting a 31st-minute penalty after borja ekiza unluckily handled the argentine 's blocked shot and then bulleting in a header from ivan rakitic 's corner 10 minutes after the restart . `` eibar did n't look like a team that has just lost seven in a row , '' said enrique , who welcomed back brazil star neymar from suspension to resume his role up front with messi and luis suarez . `` they played good football and they fully deserved their great start to the season . i do n't think they 'll have any trouble avoiding relegation . '' the result puts even more pressure on second-placed real madrid to win sunday 's home clash with levante . the european champion 's coach carlo ancelotti has been criticized after a poor run of results since the turn of the year , while world-record signing gareth bale has particularly been vilified by national sports paper marca following tuesday 's home defeat by schalke . real can take some small consolation in the fact that city rival atletico madrid could only draw 0-0 at espanyol , meaning the defending champion stayed fourth in the table following valencia 's 2-0 win over deportivo la coruna on friday . atletico defender miranda was sent off in time added on at the end of the first half for a foul on abraham . diego simeone 's side hosts german club bayer leverkusen on tuesday as it seeks to overturn a 1-0 deficit and seek to match last season 's achievement of reaching the champions league final . barca , also looking to join real in the quarterfinals , faces a city side reeling after saturday 's 1-0 defeat by relegation-threatened burnley . it left manuel pellegrini 's team five points behind english premier league leader chelsea , which has two games in hand ahead of sunday 's home clash with southampton . `` we must continue to fight but the chances of winning the title are far as things stand , '' said pellegrini , whose team must overcome a 2-1 deficit at the nou camp next week . `` there is still a chance , but it is more difficult after this result . we needed to create more chances than we did and find more space in and around their defense . '' the chilean refused to blame the referee for not awarding what appeared to be a clear penalty for city in the dying minutes , when pablo zabaleta was brought down in the box . `` was it a penalty ? maybe , but the referee decides these moments and i do n't think that was the most important thing in this game , '' he said . `` the issue for us at present is that we are not winning the games that we normally do , especially against teams we are expected to beat , and that is because we are not scoring goals . '' city , seeking to retain its epl title , is only one point ahead of third-placed arsenal after arsene wenger 's team won 3-0 at home to west ham on saturday . the london side has now won four games in all competitions since suffering a shock 3-1 home defeat by wenger 's former club monaco in the first leg of their last-16 champions league tie last month . `` we have to believe that we can do it , '' the frenchman said of tuesday 's trip to the principality . `` this time monaco are favorites so we have to go there , give absolutely everything and come out of the game with that feeling . '' monaco moved up to fourth in the french league on friday , beating nine-man bastia 3-0 as anthony martial scored twice and lavyin kurzawa missed a penalty . italian club juventus , another side in champions league action next week , went 14 points clear in serie a with a 1-0 win at mid-table palermo on saturday . spanish substitute alvaro morata ended palermo 's six-month unbeaten home run with a curling winner to maintain the turin team 's momentum ahead of wednesday 's trip to borussia dortmund . the german side , which trails 2-1 after the first leg thanks to goals from morata and carlos tevez , drew 0-0 at home to cologne saturday to remain in mid-table after a second successive scoreless draw in the bundesliga . defending champion bayern munich moved 14 points clear at the top with a 4-0 win at werder bremen , as poland striker robert lewandowski scored twice to add to his goal from the midweek champions league thrashing of shakhtar donetsk . thomas muller , who netted twice in the 7-0 routing of the ukrainian side , opened the scoring while david alaba bagged the second goal . third-placed leverkusen , meanwhile , triumphed 4-0 over stuttgart on friday , with josip drmic scoring two . wolfsburg , eight points ahead of leverkusen , hosts second-bottom freiburg on sunday . like us on facebook .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- if the wheel was man 's greatest invention , putting two wheels together comes as a close second for dani foffa , ceo of foffa bikes . his eponymous company builds bespoke urban bicycles with a stylish design that has been lauded by magazines like vogue and gq . london-based foffa tracks his passion for cycling back to his childhood in venice , italy , where biking in the city 's winding narrow streets was a rare treat . he spent his early professional career as a business analyst , before a nagging feeling that there was more to life encouraged him to start designing and building bikes , initially from his office garage . `` i started refurbishing vintage bikes up and reselling them online . and the demand just grew very gradually , steadily , to the point that it was time for us to get our own brand in the bikes , and open up our first shop . i took my chances , i quit my job , and clearly i have no regrets , '' says foffa . his company has built over 5,000 bespoke bikes since 2007 , and they were named as one of the ten best commuter bikes by the independent , a uk newspaper . foffa says that he was encouraged to start the company when he saw a gap in the market for comfortable bicycles designed for cycling in the city , which also looked good . `` in the same way that we decide what to wear , we think that the bicycle should be an extension of your personality , '' says foffa . he adds that he always relished the sense of liberty that biking afforded him , and wants to introduce the simple pleasure of a bike ride to as many people as possible . `` bikes are great for the environment , great for the health , they are the quickest and probably the cheapest way of commuting around town . and they link with that sense of adventure , that freedom that comes with it , which no other invention , as far as i 'm concerned , was able to offer me .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- solar impulse 2 has landed safely in oman on the first leg of its quest to be the first plane to fly around the world fueled only by the sun 's rays . the solar-powered plane took off from abu dhabi in the united arab emirates early on monday with pilot andre borschberg at the controls for the 400-kilometer -lrb- 250 mile -rrb- flight . the journey was expected to take about 12 hours , but high winds of up to 11 knots delayed its landing , forcing borschberg to fly in a holding pattern above muscat until they dropped to safe levels . once safely on the ground , borschberg said he was `` extremely happy '' and `` looking forward to the rest of -lsb- the -rsb- adventure . '' solar impulse 2 's visit to oman is a short pit-stop on its marathon 35,000-kilometer , five month journey across the globe , via india , myanmar , china and the u.s. . the plane is expected to be on the ground for just eight hours before it takes off again -- this time with pilot bertrand piccard in charge -- bound for ahmedabad in india . the potentially historic flight had originally been due to take off on march 1 but its departure was postponed because of concerns about the weather after strong dust storms created hazy conditions . `` we have had a lot of sandstorms in abu dhabi , and also a lot of wind , sea breezes , higher than the limit , '' said the team 's meteorologist luc truellemans in an interview posted on twitter and youtube . by monday morning , the skies had cleared sufficiently for takeoff , though there was a slight delay while technical checks were carried out , as pilot andre borschberg explained on twitter . eventually the plane got off the ground , under the watchful eye of fellow pilot piccard . monday 's journey to oman was a relatively short one , compared to some of the longer legs , which will take up to five or six days and nights . borschberg and piccard will spend a total of 500 hours behind the controls over the entire trip , taking it in turns in the tiny 3.8-square meter single-seater cockpit . before the takeoff , piccard admitted the pair `` had `` butterflies in the stomach '' at the thought of getting underway after working on the project for so long . on sunday , the pair joked about tossing a coin for the right to fly first , before tearfully revealing that they had already decided who would be doing what . `` andre has worked on this airplane ... for 12 years , from the feasibility study until now ; it is more than natural that he takes the first step , '' said piccard . borschberg added : `` bertrand deserves to fly the last leg , and to make the arrival in abu dhabi , completing the vision he created 15 years ago . '' the pair will also split ocean-flying duties : piccard will take on the five-day , five-night journey across the pacific , while borschberg will tackle the atlantic . solar impulse 's 72-meter -lrb- 236-foot -rrb- wingspan makes it wider than a boeing 747 , but the plane weighs just 2.5 tons , lighter than a large suv . the tiny cockpit will be packed with essentials for the journey -- enough food and water for a week -- as well as a parachute , life raft and oxygen bottles in case of emergencies . borschberg and piccard , who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the u.s. in 2013 , are no strangers to adventure . borschberg is a former fighter pilot , and piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999 .
kabul , afghanistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- it is a strangely formal , yet troubling scene . a room in a far flung corner of afghanistan where a serious lecture is happening , to an audience that seems part ideological , part curious ; some are just impoverished , hoping for a quick job . at the front of this room stands an afghan freshly back from fighting in syria , and intent on recruiting other afghans to fight alongside him for isis . `` brothers , i am here to tell you '' , the recruiter begins , `` about the mujahideen in syria . '' all faces are hidden in the footage , yet the motivations are clear . this seems to be part of isis 's first moves into afghanistan , a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in iraq and syria by vacuuming up disgruntled former taliban fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause . but it 's a troubling move nonetheless . there 's no shortage of battle-hardened militants here . and as nato leaves , the taliban looks strong if a little fractured -- and the possibility of peace talks ahead with the afghan government could alienate some of the group 's more radical elements . the man is one of five recruiters , he says -- some foreign , others afghan like him , spread out across the country . his message is broadly ideological . `` jihad is now obligatory not only in afghanistan , but also in many other places in the world , '' the recruiter tells the room . `` the christians and jews have not only attacked afghanistan , but they have also attacked muslims in syria , iraq and palestine . so jihad is obligatory on us in these places . '' his reception is mixed , but to one audience member the ideological appeal is clear . `` my aim is to fight infidels , '' the man says . `` in syria , or if they ask me to in afghanistan , i will . '' another man says he would prefer to stay home and go to university , but he is attracted by the recruiter 's offer of money . `` i definitely need the money , '' he says , `` but will stay here and hope peace comes . '' concerns are growing about how isis may expand into afghanistan . when asked why isis might be on the rise here , afghan president ashraf ghani told cnn 's fareed zakaria : `` the reason it 's happening is because -lrb- the -rrb- collapse of yemen , syria , iraq has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states , now there are wider spaces . '' ghani added : `` they have -- it 's one of the most well-endowed finance -- well-financed organizations . and the techniques are spreading . '' the united nations special representative to afghanistan , nicholas haysom , told the security council that isis 's presence in afghanistan was `` of concern , '' but was most troubling in its `` potential to offer an alternative flagpole to which otherwise isolated insurgent splinter groups can rally . '' a senior u.s. official told cnn that `` the terrain is there '' for isis to grow in afghanistan . this is `` something everyone is keeping a very close eye on . afghanistan government is concerned . pakistan government is concerned , '' he said , before adding that disaffected taliban might also be attracted to the group . the path to cnn 's filming with the recruiter was complex . an afghan cameraman working for cnn was introduced at first to militants seeking to recruit fighters to assist an al qaeda-linked group in syria . weeks later it emerged they were in fact working for isis . the group the militants say they come from -- khorasan -- is better known as a radical part of the al qaeda faction of al-nusra , in syria , where many afghans fight . yet isis experts say some of khorasan 's militants have defected to join isis , and those defectors in turn sent recruiters to afghanistan to try to bolster their ranks . at the meeting that our cameraman was permitted to film , the militants produced application forms that bear the logo of the islamic state -- the name the group prefers to be called -- although they appeared to be using the group 's older nomenclature of isis on the documents . while these recruiters seek to attract fighters to syria , their presence in afghanistan at this pivotal time will fuel fears that the country remains vulnerable to being used as a sanctuary for a new wave of extremists .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- when chinese photographer wang wenlan first pressed the shutter on a borrowed soviet camera in 1967 , he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during chairman mao zedong 's cultural revolution . `` i made rolls of film out of a motion-picture reel i found . the photographic paper was left over from printing mao 's portraits , '' wang told cnn . five decades later , wang , 61 , is one of the country 's top photojournalists . his work is a rich chronicle of china 's fast-changing society . `` still images are fragments , sections and points that connect the history , '' wang says . `` the whole process of china 's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- i 've been determined to and have managed to document it all . '' one of his most famous series of photographs tracks china 's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family 's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets . photography was an outlet for wang during the dark days of the cultural revolution , when china was convulsed by violent class struggle . his family were labeled `` capitalist roaders '' and unlike most other kids , he could n't join the red guards . despondent , 14-year-old wang wandered around beijing with friends in similar situations , snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself . taking photos turned into more than a pastime in january 1976 , when premier zhou enlai died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of mao 's excesses . wang went to tiananmen square with his camera , capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief , both then , and again in april that year . `` i was in deep grief , '' wang said , `` and i felt i should record the collective grief . '' he kept the film secret from the military , which then employed him as a photographer , transferring it to friends . the photos were published in the early 1980s . from then on , wang saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper . `` i did n't get photojournalism until then , '' he said . `` my biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the cultural revolution period ; it would 've been a precious record . '' in the decades following , wang has photographed not only major events -- from tangshan earthquake in 1976 and the overthrow of the gang of four , to the beijing olympic games in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in china 's changing countryside and growing cities . from april 3 , wang will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the united states at the university of iowa . curator judy polumbaum -- a chinese media scholar and former colleague of wang -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary china . `` it reflects not only the many changes in chinese society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition , and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change , '' she said . the clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit -- an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and `` the couple 's western wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom , '' she says . wang has spent most of his career at the china daily , the country 's official english-language paper , which he joined in 1980 before its official launch . back then , it broke the mold , using large photographs rather than the stamp-sized images used in most other chinese newspapers at the time , he says . it was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages , rather than national leaders -- something wang found he excelled at . `` thanks to the china daily , i stood out . it was an irreplaceable platform . '' wang finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s , when ideas emerged and collided after the cultural revolution ended . `` people thought nothing was impossible , '' he said . `` we reflected on the past and were determined to move on . it was a special time ; the air was filled with ideals , enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities . '' today 's china is different , he said . `` the country 's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s , '' he said . `` individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals . '' throughout his career , wang 's focus has changed a great deal as well . he said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography , but now , with smart phones , he says anyone can be a photographer . to wang , what matters is the perspective , he said , pointing at his head . wang says he 's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years . `` my job is n't to chant slogans . '' `` i take photos first . it 's great if they can be published ; if not , they 'll eventually be part of the history . '' next year will mark wang 's 40th year in photojournalism . he is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it `` unfinished . '' the name was inspired by the alternative title of franz schubert 's symphony no. 8 . `` china is unfinished , '' said wang , who is also fan and critic of classic music . `` it 's always a work in progress . ''
bethlehem , west bank -lrb- cnn -rrb- in the biblical city of bethlehem , sana jamaani is warmed up and ready to run . this is n't her first race , but she says it is her most important . `` i 'm running in the holy land , '' jamaani smiles . `` i 'm running in palestine . '' more than 3,000 runners came to the west bank for the palestine marathon on friday . for jamaani , this is n't just a race for time . it is a run for recognition . `` it means that you run for peace , '' jamaani says . two weeks before this marathon , more than 25,000 runners took part in the jerusalem marathon . the race was a celebration of sport in a citywide event that drew international attention and competition . the course took runners through old and new jerusalem . they were free to run . but in bethlehem , runners say they run to be free . `` we are trying to inspire people to take their own rights , '' says organizer signe fischer , `` and the right of movement is the only right that you can physically just claim . you can put on your running shoes and just take it . '' the palestine marathon is put on by the palestine olympic committee and the right to movement , a nonprofit organization that uses running as a means of activism . they focus their efforts on what they see as one of the most basic rights : movement . many of the runners are palestinian , and their movement is limited , israel says , for security reasons . the marathon course took runners along the west bank separation barrier , into the aida refugee camp , and under guard towers . nader al-masri won the marathon . he is from gaza , and he says he had to wait five hours at the erez border crossing to compete . he arrived in manger square at the finish line to a hero 's welcome . `` i saw parts of the wall all over . it 's very hard , but i 'm still proud of myself as a palestinian , '' says al-masri . in its third year , the marathon drew runners from all over the world , pilgrims of a sort making a journey to the holy land , not for religion , but for sport . `` it 's an achievement , '' said jamaani after finishing . `` everyone looks for an achievement in life , and one of them was crossing this line , especially in the palestine marathon . '' for runners like jamaani , the marathon is a statement made one step at a time .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- is philae still alive ? the answer to this particular cosmic cliff-hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year . the tiny space probe bounced across the surface of comet 67p before touching down away from its intended landing zone . it returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there was n't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since november . in the months since , mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place . but now the comet-chasing mother ship rosetta -- in orbit around 67p -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark . scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , which is leading a consortium that includes nasa to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun , believe that if enough sunlight falls on philae 's solar panels it could revive . as the comet gets closer to the sun and more light illuminates the lander , the chances improve . lander system engineer laurence o'rourke told cnn that philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself , nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two-way communication with the orbiter . modern energy-saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it does n't need much to re-establish contact . on tuesday , @esa_rosetta tweeted : `` excited ! i have some opportunities to listen for @philae2014 to find out if he 's awake ! '' rosetta and philae 's love affair on twitter . on the rosetta mission blog , lander project manager stephan ulamec says : `` it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying . the prospects will improve with each passing day . '' the mission website adds that philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with rosetta . it says rosetta will transmit to philae between march 12 and march 20 , listening for a response . problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor philae to the surface failed . the gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet , the probe bounced across the comet . however , the mishap could prove to be a happy accident . o'rourke explained that as the comet nears the sun , philae 's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics . in that position it most likely would have died by now . from lander pictures , mission controllers think philae , which is about the size of a washing machine , is tucked up underneath a cliff face , affording it some shade . beginning thursday , mission controllers will send what o'rourke described as `` blind commands '' to philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it ca n't respond . philae will be told to save power for the transmitter . o'rourke admits that it 's a `` long shot '' but the team will try again in april if this attempt fails . if philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the sun in august . `` i think we are going to see some amazing images at that point , '' said o'rourke . even if philae never wakes up , all is not lost . the mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface , though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed . and the rosetta mission is already changing perceptions of comets . o'rourke says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being `` an icy dirtball . '' he described discoveries of dust and large `` boulders '' circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits , and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole . `` the rosetta mission is not just about the lander . it 's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again , finding the secrets held by comets . every day is a new discovery , '' he said . scientists have already applauded the mission 's success to date . `` the rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together , '' cosmochemist denton s. ebel told cnn in november . cnn interactive : rosetta and its mission . opinion : how comet mission helps search for alien life .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i ca n't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government , but i will never forget the morning in 1983 when two fbi agents showed up on my parents ' doorstep . i had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer , which was pretty common for me back then , at age 18 . a few hours later , my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business . i had a slight fear this day would come , because only a couple of days earlier , i had a strange call from a friend asking me what i would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team . two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the fbi . they said they needed to talk to me . let me start with a little history : i got my first taste of computers in the mid-1970s in junior high school . we had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached . we were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing . i did not get to use it the first time , but i stayed after school that evening to see if i could get a chance to try it out . the teacher dialed into the central office computer , logged in and started the math program . i felt like a new world opened for me . for the first time in my life , i saw something that made me imagine what i wanted to do when i grew up . that junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school . there , i learned of an explorer scout group sponsored by ibm . for the next couple of years i built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others . we would play with computers at school , in explorer scouts , in stores like radio shack and at home . finally in 1982 , i bought my first computer . some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and i finally got my own . i purchased a heathkit h-89 , which we built in a friend 's basement . at the same time i also bought a hayes 309 baud smartmodem . i used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems , or bbs , and create more friendships and acquaintances . we were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked . we ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the sloan kettering cancer center in new york to a major international bank system in los angeles to the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico , one of only two u.s. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research . we were really just looking around and playing games on these systems ; we did n't want to harm anything . this was pretty easy because computers back then were built with a basic set of login information , all of it written in the manuals . we did n't see any harm in it . we would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and , when we got together for explorers , we 'd talk about exploring , not harming systems . at some point , we started calling our group the `` 4-1-4s , '' a name we came up with after hanging out at a local park . we noticed etchings on the tables with numbers like 1-9 and 2-7 , gang signatures that came from the streets where they operated . since we all lived in the milwaukee area , we more or less jokingly gave ourselves the gang name of 414s for the milwaukee area code . as the months went on , we started to notice issues staying connected with our modems for any length of time . then , the fbi showed up at my home . remember , back then home computers were very new , so there were no computer hacking laws . after about a year of back and forth with the fbi , three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls , which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $ 500 fine each . as i sat before the judge with my lawyer , he asked why he should not give me prison time . i had recently met the love of my life and we were expecting our first child . so i explained that i would like to be around to see the birth of my baby and live a happy and normal family life . the judge agreed to a plea deal with a stipulation that i could not own a modem during the time i remained on probation . under the deal , we were charged with misdemeanors that carried two years ' probation and a $ 500 fine . our records would be expunged under the federal youth corrections act . today , more than 30 years later , i 'm still fascinated by computers : i 'm employed as a network engineer and , at home , i tinker around on about half a dozen computers . oh , and i 'm still married to the love of my life . the things that we did set the stage for more than just our personal career paths : we helped create several federal laws that are still on the books for computer crime and password safety . it makes me proud as a network engineer working partially in security knowing that , in a way , what we did as a group made for safer computing today . there are still lots of issues with people using simple passwords , companies leaving too many doors open and just the massive amounts of computing power available to work on decoding and breaking into systems . we could have caused some damage to these companies and many were surprised that we just looked around and played games . today , hacking is a whole different world .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for the first time , the u.s. air force has resurrected a b-52 bomber that had been in long-term storage at the boneyard , the portion of davis-monthan air force base near tucson , arizona , where the military sends aircraft that have been retired from the fleet . the 53-year-old stratofortress , tail number 61-1007 , nicknamed the `` ghost rider '' had been in storage at the desert in the care of the 309th aerospace maintenance and regeneration group -lrb- amarg -rrb- since 2008 . thousands of aircraft are stored at the boneyard , where the dry desert environment helps preserve them . some are scavenged to supply parts to planes still in the fleet . others are brought back into service . ghost rider , after upgrades , will become the first b-52 to return to duty from the boneyard . though the dry desert air inhibits corrosion , the baking heat can have other adverse effects , including causing dry rot in the tires and fuel lines . the lines and fuel bladders in ghost rider were completely replaced , tech . sgt. stephen sorge , a fuels specialist from the 307th maintenance squadron , said in an air force report on the project . once that work was done , the plane 's engines were tested again in january . on february 13 , ghost rider flew again , a three-hour flight from davis-monthan to its new home , barksdale air force base in shreveport , louisiana . the resurrection process took 70 days , according to the air force report . `` i 've been flying the b-52s since the '80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems , '' col. keith schultz said in the air force report after piloting the eight-engine jet on the 1,000-mile flight . schultz , who with more than 6,500 hours flying b-52s is the most experienced active pilot of that aircraft in the service , led a co-pilot and a navigator , the minimum three-person crew , on the flight to louisiana . the b-52 would normally fly with a crew of five . `` those were the only three seats we had activated for egress , '' he told the shreveport times . for safety reasons , ghost rider made the entire flight with its landing gear down , at a speed of only 288 mph and at a height of 23,000 feet , well below its top speed of 650 mph and ceiling of 50,000 feet , according to the times report . it also flew without some of the other things aviators have come to rely on . `` we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed , '' schulz said in the air force release . ghost rider will replace another bomber at barksdale that was damaged by a fire during maintenance . `` we had an oxygen leak with a spark and it caused a cockpit fire . there was so much damage it was actually more economical to bring this one out of the desert , '' schultz told the times . for a time , ghost rider will sit beside the damaged b-52 for transfer of usable , updated equipment , the times reported . it is expected to resume active service next year . as of may 2014 , the air force reported there were 76 stratofortresses in its fleet , 58 in the active force and 18 in the air force reserve . besides barksdale , b-52s are based at minot air force base in north dakota .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- as cheap oil and western sanctions continue to batter russia 's economy , president vladimir putin slashed kremlin salaries -- including his own -- by 10 % friday , according to state news service tass . government documents released in 2014 put putin 's annual salary at nearly 3.7 million rubles -- worth about $ 61,000 today thanks to soaring inflation . putin 's ruble reduction for his top ministers comes some two months after he canceled their holiday vacations , citing the same economic woes . `` the government and its various structures can not afford such extensive holidays , at least not this year , '' putin told government ministers at the time . `` you know what i am talking about . '' but it was n't just top cabinet members that would feel the pinch . `` president putin also reduced the wages of kremlin administration , government staff and the chamber of accounts by 10 % as well , '' according to tass .
sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- oversized military trucks painted in desert beige hauled tanks in the same camouflage color down a dark highway late saturday past glowing billboards in the saudi arabian town of jazan . with the border with yemen little more than 20 miles away , the trucks captured on a video distributed by the news agency reuters also carried a message : suggestions of a ground incursion into yemen , which is in the throes of a houthi rebel uprising , may be more than just talk . saudi arabia and egypt have both spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground before . and on saturday , yemeni foreign minister riyadh yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in yemen within days . saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in , they wo n't leave until they have degraded the houthis ' ability to do battle , cnn 's ian lee reported . the houthis are apt guerrillas . a fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy . politically , the situation appears to be heating up . ahmed ali abdullah saleh , the son of former yemen president ali abdullah saleh , has been removed from his post as ambassador to united arab emirates , according to two aides of the nation 's current president , abdu rabu mansour hadi . hadi fled the country in february amid the houthi uprising . he went to aden and declared that he remained the country 's leader . also on sunday , pro-hadi fighters took over aden 's airport , according to security officials in aden , but that airport has n't been operational for weeks . yemen 's ex-president , ali abdullah saleh , a shiite , still holds influence over large parts of the yemeni army , and his troops are also fighting the government . in a taped speech played on yemen today tv on friday , he called for the airstrikes to stop and offered in return not to run for president in the next elections . the saudi-led coalition fighting the shiite houthis , who deposed the yemeni government and seized territory in a series of offensives , began its military action last week . it answered hadi 's call for intervention with an unrelenting air campaign called `` decisive storm . '' hadi slipped out of yemen last week and has gone to the resort town of sharm el-sheikh , egypt , to attend the arab league summit , where he is rallying support with leaders of member nations for operation determination storm . support is already broad . the coalition nations participating in the bombardments make up about a third of the league 's membership . on saturday , hadi called the houthis out : `` you violated the sovereignty -lrb- of yemen -rrb- , and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen . '' dozens have died from the coalition bombardment . houthi commanders put the death toll at 48 . most of the dead are civilians , they said . airstrikes have hit houthi militant groups , smashed their big air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure that links major towns with the capital , sanaa , a saudi official has said . the coalition has destroyed yemeni army weapons caches and military facilities . saudi naval special forces have also rescued dozens of diplomats , the official said . and many u.n. representatives have fled the unrest . saudi arabia has set up a blockade , effectively cutting off houthi supply lines , and its air force controls yemeni airspace . they have threatened to attack ships that might supply the rebels . the shiite houthis are allied with iran , a majority shiite nation . saudi arabia has accused iran of beefing up the houthis ' weaponry for their offensive . hadi denounced them on saturday as iran 's `` puppet . '' `` i say to the puppet of iran , and those who are with him , you destroyed yemen with your immature politics , and creating internal and regional crisis , '' he said . the conflict splits the region along religious lines . determination storm 's coalition comprises the majority sunni nations of saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , egypt and sudan . on saturday , houthis claimed to have shot down a sudanese jet and captured the pilot . they distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim . iran and saudi arabia are bitter rivals . having yemen become an iranian satellite country on its border would be unacceptable to the kingdom . iran has sharply denounced the saudi-dominated armed intervention . and two arab league members , lebanon and iraq , have voiced opposition to determination storm , lee reported . both countries are majority shiite . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu pointed to yemen on sunday to criticize nuclear negotiations between iran and the p5 +1 group of nations . he accused iran of trying to use the conflict in yemen to `` take over the whole middle east . '' the united states voiced approval of the airstrikes . it 's supporting them logistically and aiding coalition forces in locating targets , but it is not participating in active battle . the unrest in yemen led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces earlier this month , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- . for years , yemen had allowed u.s. drones and special operations forces to stalk aqap in the country . now , that arrangement is in tatters . on saturday , the coalition struck al anad airbase , which was used as the headquarters for u.s. counterterrorism operations , houthi commanders said . houthi rebels had taken control of the base . houthi rebels and the government began doing battle in 2004 , but arrived at a ceasefire in 2010 , according to the cia world factbook . the country has seen much unrest in the wake of the arab spring uprising . arab spring was n't supposed to turn out like this . yemen was plunged into chaos when the houthi rebels , who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country , began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country last fall . houthis moved into sanaa in september , sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called . in january , they surrounded the presidential palace and hadi resigned and was put under house arrest . in february the houthis took control of military forces stationed near sanaa , including the air force . but the chaos is not limited to the houthi uprising . in the area of the southern port city of aden , opposing yemeni military forces -- those allied with the houthis , and those supporting hadi -- have fought for more than a week . correction : pakistan is not participating in airstrikes over yemen , the pakistani embassy in washington said . cnn previously included pakistan in an illustration of coalition member countries participating the operation determination storm . the illustration said the country was contributing 15 jets . that illustration has since been updated . journalist hakim almasmari reported from sanaa ; cnn 's ben brumfield wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's jason hanna and ian lee contributed to this report .
montabaur , germany -lrb- cnn -rrb- on the surface , germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz seemed , in the words of those who had known him , normal , capable , even fun . but , german prosecutors said friday , he was clearly trying to hide something in the days before he sent germanwings flight 9525 plowing into a mountain , killing himself and 149 others aboard . investigators searching lubitz 's dusseldorf apartment said they found documents revealing he 'd been declared unfit for work . the letter , dusseldorf prosecutor christoph kumpa , said , was found `` slashed '' in a dust bin . the revelation only adds to the myriad questions swirling around lubitz , 27 , whom authorities say deliberately destroyed the plane . the biggest question of all , still , is why ? lufthansa ceo ` speechless ' that 's the question police were hoping to answer as they searched lubitz 's apartment . police spokesman markus niesczery said a team of five investigators went `` through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down . '' they did n't find a goodbye note or anything directly explaining the crash , the public prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf said in a statement . they say it will be a few more days before they can say anything more publicly about what they found . outside the apartment , neighbors contacted friday said they did n't know lubitz and are simply flummoxed by all the attention to the quiet suburban neighborhood featuring a handful of businesses , restaurants , running rails and a lake . meanwhile , about 85 miles -lrb- 136 kilometers -rrb- away in the town of montabaur , the house where lubitz 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police . a group of men , perhaps investigators , were the only ones granted access on thursday . on friday , there was no activity at all . montabaur , in western germany , is where lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age . at a club on the outskirts of town , pilots who knew lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said . they said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane . between age 14 and age 20 , lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club . '' -lrb- he was -rrb- a very normal young person , full of energy , '' klaus radke said . `` what can i say ? he had a bright future . he made his hobby into his job . what more can you hope to achieve ? '' the authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for peter ruecker , another pilot who knew him from the flight club . `` knowing andreas , this is just inconceivable for me , '' ruecker told the reuters news agency . `` he was a lot of fun , even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet , '' ruecker said . `` he was just another boy , like so many others here . '' an acquaintance said lubitz was health conscious . he was a recreational athlete and did n't smoke . `` i ca n't imagine that he was mentally ill , depressed and sad . he does n't seem like that , '' johannes rossbach told cnn . `` so i was shocked when i heard that . '' an 8-minute descent to death . before tuesday 's crash , lubitz appeared to have a `` clean bill of health , '' according to a germanwings representative . then came friday 's announcement of the discovery of documents revealing an illness that apparently made him unfit to fly a plane -- in the eyes of at least one doctor . prosecutors did n't reveal what the illness was , but said the discovery `` leads to the preliminary conclusion , that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment . '' the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported that lubitz suffered from mental illness . meanwhile , a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently 17 days ago , `` concerning a diagnosis . '' but the university clinic said it had not treated lubitz for depression . lubitz had been with germanwings , a budget airline owned by lufthansa , since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the airline 's media office said . officials say he passed a psychological test when he was hired , had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight . lufthansa ceo carsten spohr told reporters that lubitz `` interrupted '' his training , which he began in 2008 . that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon . spohr said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training . if it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation . reuters reported that a german newspaper , bild , said lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago . citing internal documents forwarded by lufthansa to german authorities , bild reported that lubitz had suffered a `` serious depressive episode '' around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009 , reuters reported . the bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment . lufthansa officials and german prosecutors declined to comment on the bild story , reuters said . most of lubitz 's training took place at the lufthansa flight training center in germany . he also trained in the united states , spending six months at facility in arizona as part of a required program to get his license , a lufthansa spokesperson said . a former trainer at the facility said the training is `` extremely stressful . '' `` what made the hairs stand up on my neck in this case is that the co-pilot took some time off during training . for me that is very inexplicable and highly unusual , '' oly olson said . `` usually the pilot trainees either progress or wash out , i never saw anyone take a break . '' he clarified his remark , saying some people left due to a death in the family . spohr said lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying . however , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said . `` we do n't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , '' spohr said . `` he was 100 % set to fly without restrictions , '' he added . `` his flight performance was perfect . there was nothing to worry about .

jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- in a sea of jewish parties campaigning at hebrew university , ayman odeh was the star attraction . but this powerful new face in israeli politics is not jewish . while he is an israeli citizen , the charismatic 41-year-old lawyer is of palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million israeli arabs living in israel . under odeh 's leadership , israel 's tiny , splintered arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the joint list . come election day on tuesday , they are poised to take as many as 15 seats . this could potentially make them the third-largest party in the knesset after benjamin netanyahu 's likud party and his main rival , the zionist camp coalition , potentially giving them the balance of power . it is a game-changer , giving a significant voice to one-fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second-class citizens . his most immediate goal is to deny a new term to netanyahu , who he says has led the `` most racist government in history . '' `` netanyahu says the danger to israel is not palestinians in the west bank , but rather arabs in israel . what is that telling me as a citizen of haifa ? '' he asked in an interview on saturday . `` with 15 seats in the knesset , no one will ever be able to ignore us again . '' until now , arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences . they run the spectrum from communist to islamist . but a law passed by the last knesset , sponsored by the right-wing party of foreign minister avigdor lieberman , raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the knesset . many believed lieberman 's goal was to push the arab parties out of the knesset . it 's a theory that was given credence when , in recent televised debate , lieberman warned odeh , `` you are here for now . '' `` why are you even here ? '' leiberman said to odeh . baiting him by accusing him of `` representing terror groups , '' lieberman turned to odeh and said , `` you 're not wanted here . '' odeh politely noted that his joint list was polling well ahead of lieberman 's party . `` i 'm very wanted in my homeland , '' he said . `` i 'm part of the scenery . i resemble it . '' with that calm , dignified response , odeh attracted political star status among jews and arabs alike . at the hebrew university forum , event students campaigning for the labor party and the left-wing meretz party wanted to take selfies with him . more importantly , he has given hope to the 1.6 million palestinians who hold israeli citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality . in the wadi nisnas neighborhood of haifa where odeh grew up , the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son . odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician , speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the joint list gets enough seats to change the face of the israeli government . over hummus and stuffed vegetables , he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between israel 's jews and its arab population , speaking about issues such as education , housing , employment for women , public transportation in arab towns and recognition of unrecognized bedouin communities in the negev . growing up , he says he identified with malcolm x . but as he got older , he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of martin luther king jr. . with a large block in parliament , odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a palestinian state living beside israel . `` what makes people vote is the hope of change , '' he said . `` we have been ceding hope again and again . but we are 20 % of the population . we can prevent the right from forming a government . '' there is some skepticism here that arabs will finally have a say in how the government is run , but most are hopeful . sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street , sami abuliat says odeh is a good spokesman for palestinians living inside israel . `` we 've asked for so many rights we do n't we wo n't get , '' abuilat says . `` the big eat the small . but united , we can be strong . this is a good first step . '' if , as many expect , likud or labor fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government , they may be forced to join together in a `` national unity '' government . that would make the next biggest group of parties , and odeh , the official opposition . it 's a position he says he would prefer over joining an israeli government , which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the palestinians . the prime minister is required to brief the leader of the opposition at least once a month on diplomatic and security matters . odeh would be entitled to a seat on israel 's foreign affairs committee in the knesset and is obligated to address the knesset after every speech by the prime minister . he would also protected by the shin bet security service . he would have the ear of foreign leaders , who would reach out and meet with him to hear his views . odeh says he needs the help of israeli jews , who he hopes one day will become a greater voice in the cause of social justice for all israelis . `` arabs alone can not make a democracy strong . it has to be arabs and jews , '' he says . `` my dream is one day we will build a real arab-jew party , and i tell jews to come join us and build a true democratic party in this country . '' it 's a message that resonates back at hebrew university , where some jewish students are joining the fight against what they call institutional discrimination in israel . `` it is not only a struggle of the palestinian minority living in israel . it is the struggle of the palestinian minority together with democratic jews like myself , '' says ofer , a student with the jewish communist hadash party . it 's not a vision shared by most in israel , but odeh 's message to students is `` this is your chance . '' by finding their voice and using their vote , he says , they can make the dream of equality a reality .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- how can i describe life in crimea after a year under russia 's control ? you start saying things like `` let 's not talk about this on the phone '' and become careful about the facebook pages you `` like . '' because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the soviet union . in just one year so much has been lost and many crimeans seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone 's life . there is a growing level of censorship , inequality and political repression of those who do n't agree with the government . in everyday communication , crimeans , including those who support putin and russia , have to think about what they do and say . thanks to the activities of the fsb -lrb- russia 's secret police -rrb- denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again . in the soviet union , especially in the late 1930s , denunciations written by soviet citizens about their neighbors , friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and gulag camps . now in crimea , no one feels safe . anyone who does n't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a `` joyful '' conversation with the security services . significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights , like freedom of movement . now , there are two borders manned by armed -- and sometimes angry -- men who always have questions about where you are going and why you want to pass . for ethnic ukrainians and crimean tatars , things have been very difficult and thousands fled to mainland ukraine in the first months after annexation . their fears were confirmed when ukrainian activists and young tatars began to disappear . some were later found dead , others are still missing . ukrainian patriots also left in the first month or two after occupation -- it would have been dangerous and uncomfortable to continue living on the peninsula . the next wave of migrants were those who hoped to adjust to the new rules , but could not . they started leaving when it became clear that things would get worse economically and politically . they have been replaced by a new set of arrivals from russia : officials , police , fsb and other authorities . after annexation , many who had worked for the ukrainian government in the police , army and security services swapped allegiances to the russian side . the kremlin was happy to have them but has put special stamps the new recruit 's personal files , which say they are `` inclined to betrayal . '' one of the main arguments of pro-russian locals is that the average salary in russia is much higher . indeed , since annexation , salaries have increased , especially in the public institutions like hospitals and schools . the salary increases caused a kind of post-referendum euphoria , which quickly fizzled in late 2014 when a strong dollar meant higher prices for everything from food to gadgets . then wages were cut again , by anywhere from 30 % to 70 % depending on the industry . many doctors and teachers were greatly dissatisfied with wage cuts , but no one protested because in russia , you must obtain permission for a public assembly . of course , permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the kremlin . tourism , a formerly dependable income source for many crimeans , has been hit very hard . more than half of all tourists who used to visit crimea in the summer were ukrainian and last year tourism was down by 50 % . last summer , the peninsula was empty and many hotel owners had almost no customers . despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation , many of those who were for the annexation of crimea continue to support russia . as strange as it may sound , the harder life becomes here in crimea , the more people support putin and hate ukraine . in a little over a year , the russian propaganda machine has turned ukraine from `` brother state '' to russia 's main enemy . for some crimeans 2014 was a year of tragedy and farewell to their homeland . others saw a dream realized . what things will look like in another year is unclear , but what is clear is that nothing will be the same again .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- history has repeated itself at indian wells with the surprise withdrawal of serena williams from the semifinal due to a knee injury . williams ' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister venus pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott , amid claims of racism , that only ended this year . williams had been due to play romanian simona halep on friday night , but instead posted news of her withdrawal on instagram . `` four months ago i began a journey to play indian wells and it was amazing . i never dreamed i could do it . but i would not have been able to do this without my fans . though it ended early due to injury this year , i have to say i can not wait to try again next year . thanks everyone . i love you so much ! '' williams posted . back in 2001 , crowds booed a young serena as she took on belgian kim clijsters in the final of the competition now known as the bnp paribas open . despite being on home soil , spectators backed clijsters in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster pam shriver said were difficult to watch . `` you would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the u.s. player , so it clearly was the exact opposite . because she was american , because she was so young , because she was african-american , predominantly white audience . it was tough , it was tough to listen to , '' shriver told cnn 's open court . shriver watched as spectators booed serena 's father richard and sister venus , as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match . `` that 's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals , '' shriver said . minutes before the highly-anticipated semifinal between the two sisters , venus pulled out due to a knee injury . her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors , which the family denies , that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father , who kept a tight control on his daughters ' careers . despite the booing , williams beat clijsters to take the title . but the issue did not end there . days later , richard williams gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse , bill dwyre , who covered the match for l.a. times told open court . `` richard williams had said that the n-word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated . ... that was the beginning of serena never coming back . '' after 14 years of refusing to play at indian wells , serena williams , who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade , said that she was `` following her heart '' by deciding to rejoin the tournament . `` in order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything , '' she told reporters at a pre-match news conference . serena said she discussed it with her father in a `` really emotional '' conversation and he agreed . `` he said it would be a big mistake if i did n't go back and i thought that was really admirable , '' williams said . before the match , she told reporters that , by returning , she felt like she 'd already won . `` i do n't think i need to hold the trophy at the end of it . i feel like i 'm already holding the trophy . i 've never felt that way before , '' she said . `` just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it 's a wonderful feeling . '' williams ' early exit gives halep a free pass to the final .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the collapse of marriage in our poorest communities -- and its tragic impact -- is a familiar story . but increasingly , marriage is becoming a marker of class privilege in america , something increasingly reserved for the affluent . if progressives want to tackle the scourge of inequality , then the retreat from marriage is an issue they ca n't ignore . the reality is that the retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class -- the two-thirds of americans without a college degree . this is occurring even as in upscale america , marital bonds remain comparatively strong . `` this is the marriage gap , and it 's something new in america , '' declares a manifesto on `` marriage opportunity '' unveiled in a recent washington monthly cover story . it was penned by four astute social and political analysts , david blankenhorn , jonathan rauch , barbara dafoe whitehead and bill galston . -lrb- full disclosure : i 'm a signer of their statement . -rrb- . `` over the past several decades , the norm of marriage has eroded across all economic and educational classes , but much less among the elite , '' they write . `` but for millions of middle - and lower-class americans , marriage is increasingly beyond reach , creating more fractured and difficult family lives , more economic insecurity for single parents , less social mobility for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder , more childhood stress , and a fraying of our common culture . '' true , overall u.s. marriage rates have fallen from 72 % of u.s. adults in 1960 to just 51 % in 2012 , according to the economist . but drill a little deeper into the data , and a marital class divide emerges . less than half of men with high school degrees are married , compared with 76 % of men with college degrees . the pattern is similar among women , except that those with graduate degrees have somewhat lower marriage rates than those with four-year college degrees . and because the college-educated tend to look for mates with similar education and earning power , their unions push them even higher up the income scale -- further widening the economic gulf between marital haves and have-nots . marriage in america , it seems , is becoming another luxury item for economic elites to enjoy . so why should we worry ? `` declining marriage rates may not be concerning on their own , but while americans are forgoing marriage , they are not forgoing childbearing , '' say isabel sawhill and joanna venator of the brookings institution . more than 40 % of children are born outside wedlock today -lrb- including nearly three-quarters of black children -rrb- . and a raft of social research shows that children who grow up in married , two-parent families do better in school and in life than those who do n't . it 's true that more children are being raised by cohabiting couples , but in the united states -lrb- unlike some european countries -rrb- these relationships tend to be unstable and short-lived . some see the decline of marriage as stemming from a tectonic cultural shift -- the rise of feminism and the surge of women into work -- that has blurred the old division of familial labor between male breadwinners and female homemakers . but economic changes , mainly the disappearance of manufacturing jobs , automation and wage stagnation , have played a big part in the story , too . liberals are eager to talk about their favorite economic fixes for inequality : raising the minimum wage , bolstering unions and taxing the rich to pay for new social benefits for families of modest means . but they seem uncomfortable talking about marriage , which is seen as an unwelcome distraction from issues of economic power . it 's tempting to blame such reticence on president george w. bush 's ill-fated healthy marriage initiative , which triggered a flurry of new federal marriage promotion programs over the previous decade . a centerpiece of bush 's `` compassionate conservatism , '' the initiative managed to polarize the social policy community while having a negligible impact on falling marriage rates . in truth , though , liberals have a long tradition -- at least since daniel patrick moynihan 's warnings in the 1960s of the consequences of family breakdown in black communities -- of shying away from `` cultural '' explanations for poverty and inequality . they need to get over it . inequality as we know it today arises from the intricate interplay of economic and cultural changes , and wo n't be reversed simply by redistributing income from affluent to downscale families . high marriage rates in upper middle-class america make the link between family structure and economic success abundantly clear . for example , economists robert lerman and w. bradford wilcox estimate that the median income of families with children would be 44 % higher today if america had the same marriage rates we had in 1980 . today , a record number of americans -- one in five adults 25 and older -- have never been married . it 's probably not because our society is evolving away from a fundamental social institution that has endured for , oh , most of human history . in fact , researchers say aspirations to marriage are as high as ever , but the practical barriers are getting harder to surmount . which brings us back to the `` marriage opportunity '' manifesto . rather than actively promoting marriage -- something government has shown it does n't really know how to do -- the opportunity agenda aims at removing impediments to marriage , especially for non-elite americans . this includes a raft of familiar policy proposals for boosting the economic prospects of low-income workers and making taxes more family-friendly . intriguingly , the four authors point to the one cultural shift that 's bucking the trend toward diminishing demand for weddings -- the public 's dramatic turnaround on same-sex marriage . they envision a possible political bargain in which conservatives accept gays as allies in fortifying marriage , and liberals recognize that family breakdown is magnifying america 's disparities of wealth and income . could expanding marriage opportunity really become common ground in america 's intensely polarized culture wars ? it seems like an extravagant hope . but blankenhorn and company are emphatically right that both progressives and conservatives have a big stake in reversing the retreat from marriage .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- lewis hamilton laid down a daunting marker for his formula one rivals at saturday 's qualifying for the opening race of the 2015 season . the world champion will start on pole for the australian grand prix , as he did last year and has done on three other occasions in his career . while the british driver failed to finish the 2014 race -- the only time he did not convert first on the grid to first at the checkered flag -- he is more hopeful this time as he seeks his first victory in melbourne since winning his only other world title back in 2008 . hamilton was over half a second quicker than mercedes teammate nico rosberg , and nearly 1.4 seconds faster than third-placed felipe massa of williams . `` we had a difficult season last year here , so definitely as a team , as a whole , we 're hoping for a better start , for both cars to succeed tomorrow , '' the 30-year-old said . `` so we 're going to work as hard as we can to make sure we do that and lots of work to be done tonight for the race tomorrow , because that is going to be a huge challenge still and obviously a good fight , hopefully , with nico . '' rosberg , runner-up in last year 's championship amid considerable tension between the two drivers , said his teammate `` drove like a champ . '' `` lewis was in impressive form today , he did an awesome job and nailed it all the time , '' said the german , who had an engine cutout in the second session and then ran wide in q3 . `` for me , the speed was there but i just did n't get it together today . so it was n't a great day . `` lewis was quick but i did n't get my laps together today so i 'm not too worried about pace -- i 'm not worried about pace at all . on friday , in the long runs , my pace was very strong so yeah , hopefully it can be the other way tomorrow . '' the veteran massa said he achieved his goal of being the `` best of the rest '' as he finished just ahead of ferrari 's new signing sebastian vettel and the german 's teammate kimi raikkonen . `` the ferraris looked strong and were pushing us hard , '' said the brazilian , who has failed to finish in seven of 12 starts at albert park including last year . `` it will be a tough battle tomorrow so we need to get the start right and have a good strategy to secure a podium and really start the season on a high note . '' massa 's williams teammate valtteri bottas qualified sixth but will face a fitness test on sunday morning after experiencing back pain in the first two sessions . four-time world champion vettel played down ferrari 's big improvement on last season 's speed . `` let 's keep our feet on the ground . so far this weekend , it 's gone well and we 've had no problems with the car , '' said the former red bull star . `` it 's a shame that third place escaped us , as that would have made us the first team behind mercedes , but it was n't by much . we lost third place because my first run was n't quick enough : i 'm not very pleased with myself , because there was still some performance to be found . `` first and second are a long way in front , but anything can happen during the grand prix . there 's not much of a gap between third and fourth on the grid , so i think the podium is a realistic goal . '' last year vettel was upstaged by new teammate daniel ricciardo , who qualified second and then finished runner-up in his home race only to be disqualified for a fuel-flow infringement . on sunday he will start in seventh place as red bull 's renault-powered car struggled to match the mercedes engines , while vettel 's replacement daniil kvyat was 13th after failing to reach q3 . `` we suffered a bit this time last year , but there are a few more issues this year which were n't expected , '' said ricciardo , who was third in the 2014 championship . `` i 'm really happy with seventh as realistically that 's the best we could have done today . '' red bull 's feeder team toro rosso had an encouraging start with its two rookie drivers . carlos sainz jnr. , son of the former rally champion , qualified eighth while dutch 17-year-old max verstappen -- whose father jos raced in f1 -- was 12th . lotus rounded out the top 10 with romain grosjean ninth ahead of teammate pastor maldonado . sauber 's new pairing of felipe nasri and marcus ericsson qualified 11th and 16th respectively after they were able to take to the track when last season 's reserve driver giedo van der garde waived his court-won right to line up in melbourne . the dutchman , who was successful in his legal battle to have an agreement for a race seat upheld , released a statement after friday 's practice sessions saying he would continue to negotiate with sauber to resolve the situation . mclaren , meanwhile , confirmed all the preseason evidence that its new relationship with engine supplier honda is yet to bear fruit . with marussia having failed to get its hastily-prepared car ready in time , the english team -- which has won 12 drivers ' titles and eight constructors ' crowns -- will start at the back of the grid . former world champion jenson button was 17th and kevin magnussen -- filling in for new signing fernando alonso , who is recovering from concussion -- was 18th . `` this level of performance was n't a surprise for us : we knew from winter testing that the pace was n't there , so we knew we were n't going to be competitive here , '' button said . `` however , there 's a good feeling about the car -- i know we 're so far off , but the basic car is there beneath me , and we 're adding to our experience and learning with every lap we do . `` it 's going to be a really difficult race for us -- we have n't done a race distance yet , and my longest run is 12 laps -- but we want to do the best we can because there 's so much learning to be had .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- forget the pyramids , tahrir square and the nile . egypt is ready to ditch cairo and build a shiny new capital if the government has its way . fed up with pollution , traffic gridlock , a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure , egypt is teaming up with a developer in the united arab emirates to build a city in what could be one of the world 's most ambitious infrastructure programs . the yet-to-be-named city will spread out over 150 square miles , or roughly the size of denver , and could eventually be home to 7 million people , the developers and government announced friday . the current capital of cairo , while full of history and vibrant charm , is home to more than 18 million people , and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating . the government says the idea is to reduce congestion in cairo , which is projected to double in population in the coming decades . an exact location was not announced , but the city is expected to be built east of cairo . it will be closer to the red sea -- between two major highways -- the suez and the ain sokhna roads . the ambitions are big . in addition to the new embassies and government buildings , it plans to have an international airport bigger than heathrow , solar energy farms , 40,000 hotel rooms , nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals -- all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads . but if the dream is big , the bill will be bigger . the total cost is estimated at u.s. $ 45 billion , minister of housing mostafa madbouly announced at an economic development conference in sharm el-sheikh . the unveiling of the new capital was paired with a glitzy website with renderings showing a lush and technological urban scape of glass towers and pools . the plan is backed by a group that describes itself as `` a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships '' led by emirati developer mohamed alabbar . alabbar made his name as the founder of dubai 's emaar properties , primarily known for developing the world 's tallest building , the burj khalifa . egypt is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures . myanmar has only recently completed its move from crumbling yangon to the new city of naypyidaw . nigeria moved to abuja in the 1990 's , and brazil carved its capital brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago . and then there was another crazy idea of building a capital on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators at the time . that city ? washington , d.c.
-lrb- cnn -rrb- students en route to yangon , myanmar , to protest an education bill were met with violence from police tuesday , according to multiple media reports and international watch groups . `` we all watched while a young man was beaten extremely hard and repeatedly by about three or four policemen in heavy riot gear , '' u zarni , a spokesman for the cooperative committee for trade unions , told cnn . students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities , but these have been curbed because of the crackdown . the violence tuesday occurred in letpadan , a town of about 145 kilometers -lrb- 90 miles -rrb- north of yangon , the nation 's largest city . the students ' march began in mandalay , about 640 kilometers -lrb- 400 miles -rrb- north of yangon . zarni said the students had been `` given the red light '' on proceeding to yangon . `` they had decided they would drive into the city , meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse , '' zarni said . `` but within about an hour of being given this information , they were told that was n't the case . '' `` some students decided they would try , thinking the police would just take them away , but the police were so brutal . '' police arrested about 40 to 50 people , according to zarni . `` they broke a reporter 's camera and cheered about it . they hit women . they hit monks who were also there . they went into the monastery and detained everyone who had run to hide in there , '' zarni said . human rights issues have been at the forefront in myanmar , also known as burma , as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule , with elections planned for late this year . `` the public and we are losing confidence in the democratic transitions , '' zarni said . khin lay , director of the triangle women support group , agreed . `` students , human rights , women 's rights -- we 're all extremely angry about the way we have been treated over the years , '' said lay . `` but we 've been waiting for the 2015 elections with patience because we believe in the democracy movement , and we 're hoping that we have the opportunity to exercise our right to vote . so they should show us some respect , too .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of israel , with images of missiles , terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across tv screens and newspapers . so you would think that security would be the central issue in tuesday 's israeli elections , right ? the short answer is no . poll after poll in israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election . indeed , even a majority of israel 's arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the palestinians in the west bank and gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for tuesday 's parliamentary poll , rather than advancing the israeli-palestinian peace process . what explains this apparent indifference ? first , despite what the polls suggest , peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in israeli politics . the main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue , and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks . whatever they may say to pollsters , many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue . however , because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds , they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs , so their votes are not in play in these elections . this was n't always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left . however , for some time now , the majority of israelis have shared a consensual position on the palestinian question . in principle , they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process . however , in practice , that same majority believes that even if an israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable , israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile . why ? experience has certainly taught middle israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the palestinians , irrespective of the complexion of the israeli government . in 2000 , for example , a labor-led government agreed to a palestinian state in all of gaza , 97 % of the west bank and arab east jerusalem , including the holiest site in judaism , the temple mount . yet not only did yasser arafat reject the deal , but the palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against israeli civilians . add in the fact that subsequent unilateral israeli withdrawals from south lebanon and gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at israeli civilians , and the 2008 decision by palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas to reject israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's peace proposal -- a plan similar to the clinton parameters that arafat rejected in 2000 -- and israeli wariness is easy to understand . since then , leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the israeli public 's skepticism -- the likud leader benjamin netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a palestinian state based on the 1967 borders , only for abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging american peace outline including this element , according to israel 's channel 2 , even when he was presented with it directly by president obama himself . as a result of all this , much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues , where voters hope political change in israel can actually make a real difference to their lives . indeed , the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is moshe kahlon 's centrist party kulanu , whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in israel . -lrb- kahlon won fame in israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market . -rrb- . in keeping with the mood of the public , the ex-likudnik presents a moderate image on the palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security . in fact , one senior israeli official told me that kahlon 's team has been advised against even mentioning the word `` peace '' for the rest of the campaign . that says it all .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it has been one of the world 's longest and deadliest civil conflicts . since the first incidents more than three decades ago , an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost . it has been , some say , a battle by activists among turkey 's kurdish minority for independence . it has been , others say , a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts . whatever it has been to the parties involved , the leader of the militant group at the forefront of the kurdish insurgency in turkey says it is time now for it to be over . `` our struggle came to the point it can not continue as it is , '' abdullah ocalan , longtime leader of the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , said earlier in march from his jail cell . in a letter read to thousands gathered in the southeastern turkey city of diyarbakir to mark persian new year , ocalan called for `` a new era '' with kurds gathering as `` a democratic society with the right to a democratic identity -- within turkey and on the constitutional citizenship basis . '' he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms , stop their war against the turkish state and join a `` congress '' to focus on the future . ocalan 's letter is nothing less than historic . as recently as 2012 , the long-simmering war between the pkk and the turkish government had heated to the point that the international crisis group , a conflict resolution organization monitoring the conflict , counted more than 700 dead over 14 months . `` we 're seeing the longest pitched battles between the -lrb- turkish -rrb- army and the pkk , we 're seeing a widespread campaign of kidnapping , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the pkk . they 're very much on the offensive and unfortunately this is matched by much harder line rhetoric on both sides , '' hugh pope , chief author of an international crisis group report , told cnn in 2012 . perhaps vocally underscoring the cultural split between the turkish government and the country 's kurdish population , when ocalan 's letter was read to crowds march 21 , it was read in two languages -- kurdish first , then turkish . the letter was read by sirri sureyya onder , deputy of turkey 's pro-kurdish people 's democratic party . onder is one of the few people regularly allowed to meet ocalan at the prison where he is held on imrali island . `` saturday officially showed us all that we have moved on to the negotiation period from the dialogue period we 've been working on , '' onder told cnn in a phone interview . about a fifth of turkey 's population is kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression , most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of turkey . by 1998 -- 14 years after the insurgency began -- turkey counted up to 18,000 pkk guerrillas living in the mountains . the next year , ocalan -- a hero to some , a villain to others -- was captured in kenya by turkish authorities , reportedly with the help of the cia . the united states , the european union and turkey classify the pkk as a terrorist group . ocalan was sentenced by the turkish government to life in prison for treason , and for years , he was the sole prisoner of imrali . it 's an alcatraz-like island fortress best known in the west as the locale for the 1970s book and movie `` midnight express . '' now , he gets to choose fellow inmates . ocalan began the pkk in 1978 as a kurdish separatist group in turkey , part of a larger separatist movement by kurds scattered throughout the region . northern syria , southern turkey and northern iraq have been home to millions of kurds for thousands of years . there are also millions of kurds in iran , where they make up about 10 % of the mostly persian nation 's population . violence flared in august 1984 when fighters from the pkk , which has a marxist-leninist philosophy , killed two turkish soldiers . as the years passed and the death toll mounted , the pkk proved to be a militant leg of a regional ethnic struggle to carry on the kurdish culture . but there have been periods of calm and times of talk . in 2009 , turkish intelligence officials allegedly met with high-ranking pkk members in oslo , norway , to begin a series of secret talks . in mid-2011 , the talks were interrupted by new clashes . the armed fights were followed by a hunger strike by kurdish political prisoners in 2012 , who ended the strike after 67 days upon ocalan 's request . things picked back up when president recep tayyip erdogan announced talks with the imprisoned ocalan in december 2012 . since then , the turkish government has lifted language bans , released political prisoners and continued talks with ocalan despite opposition criticism . in return , the jailed leader notably pronounced disarmament intentions and called for a ceasefire in his persian new year 's letter in 2013 . on may 8 of that year , the pkk announced a slow withdrawal from turkey . but tensions between the sides sparked again when the predominantly kurdish-populated city of kobani was invaded by isis in october and turkey did n't directly intervene . talks between the pkk and the turkish government continued , though . but at istanbul 's dolmabahce palace last month , senior government officials met with pro-kurdish parliamentarians and declared a `` road map '' accord on the way to a stable solution . onder said that ocalan 's letter `` shows us that the ... road map decided at dolmabahce is now a concrete step -- one that suits the spirit and the context of the resolution period . '' but the government view over the accord seems to be divided . erdogan told reporters that he does not fancy the declaration . erdogan was not present at dolmabahce either . onder said , `` despite the president 's opposing remarks , the turkish government took responsibility about its kurdish problem for the first time . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- pablo picasso once asked : `` are we to paint what 's on the face , what 's inside the face or what 's behind it ? '' jessica todd harper 's photo book `` the home stage '' does all three simultaneously . `` the home stage '' contains intimate , psychological portraits that harper has created of herself , her family and friends , and their children . the book weaves in some photos of other people 's families as well , and includes writing by alain de botton and alison nordstrom . using her camera like a paintbrush to stroke the canvas that is her environment , harper explores the experiences of parenting and childhood . as a mother to twin sons and a daughter , her photos contain a wide range of raw emotion , ranging from comfort and conflict to sleepiness and satisfaction . harper 's first photo book , `` interior exposure , '' focused on the early years of her marriage and adult family life . she says her latest book is like a natural segue , as `` the home stage '' includes many photos of children . the title -- `` the home stage '' -- has more than one particular meaning or reference . `` one is to convey that stage in life when you 're anchored to the home with young children , '' harper said . `` it also references how the home is the first stage in which children learn how to live in every situation . in my particular pictures , many of them have a stage-like quality . there 's reference to tableau vivant of the past , these constructed images . '' harper 's mother was a big fan of the arts , and she would take young harper and her sister to local art museums where they would copy paintings by hand , progressing from crayons to charcoal and , eventually , to pastels . `` i wanted to be just like mary cassatt and john singer sargent ; those were the artists that i would copy a lot as a child , '' she said . `` i think those images got very much stuck into my deep psyche . '' she emphasizes that her photos are not the everyday snapshots that many parents post on facebook -- the photos of children at various stages in their lives , attending birthday parties or riding tricycles . the book 's pictures `` are n't documents , '' harper said . `` they 're making everyday moments have an eternal quality . it reminds us of our more general purpose in life , the meaning in everyday small things . '' the combination of harper 's color palette and the use of natural light fills every inch of her photos with rich detail . many of harper 's photos contain several generations of her family , highlighting connections between the present , past and future . while the people harper photographs are predominantly those most familiar with her , she makes an effort to not allow her camera to completely consume the lives of her subjects . `` i try to do a very good job of not being overbearing . ... i bring out the camera only when i have a very specific idea in mind . my children know that i 'm an artist , i 'm a photographer . they know that , but i do n't think that they see that even in the top 10 of the ways that they relate to me , it 's not as subjects , '' she said . `` i want to keep it that way because otherwise they become so self-conscious and they start doing things which are not natural or genuine . '' each photo draws the curtain to reveal harper 's home stage -- harper lying in bed with her son marshall , her husband playing in the backyard with their children , her daughter sitting in a high chair . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . regardless of the subject matter of the photos , harper says there is one thing that ties all of them together : light . throughout `` the home stage , '' harper also manages to effectively create a balance between carefully planned compositions and naturally occurring moments . while harper recognizes that raising young children can be intense and tiresome , she emphasizes it is vital to take the initiative to create memories -- not simply wait to capture certain moments . this is evident with the self-portrait she made holding her son nicholas , stopping her family in the midst of their dinner preparations . `` at the time , i felt like so many parents . i felt tired and distracted and busy trying to get things done . i felt a little bit of guilt about making this picture , '' harper said . `` and yet i knew somewhere in the back of my head that there was an imperative that i must take moments . ... you 're just so busy that if you do n't purposefully force it , then it would n't happen .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- british military advisers are training ukrainian troops in ukraine , the uk said thursday , as part of efforts to support the government in kiev as it combats pro-russian separatists in the east . prime minister david cameron announced last month that britain would send military advisers to ukraine and provide an additional 15 million pounds -lrb- $ 22.3 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid . an uneasy truce has been in place since last month between the ukrainian forces and pro-russian separatists in ukraine 's eastern donetsk and luhansk regions . last month , uk defence secretary michael fallon told parliament that britain was `` providing additional nonlethal support '' in the form of advisory and training teams . `` this support , provided at the request of the ukrainian government , will help their armed forces develop and maintain the capacity and resilience they need , and help reduce fatalities and casualties , '' fallon said . the organization for security and co-operation in europe , which has been monitoring the ceasefire , said wednesday that its observers had witnessed continued fighting in areas around donetsk airport and shyrokyne , east of the port city of mariupol . kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the presence of foreign military instructors in ukraine did nothing to reduce tensions , russian state news agency sputnik reported . `` obviously , this is not helping in the building of trust or in easing the tensions in the conflict . it can be simply said that this is not aiding in the settlement , that 's a fact , '' peskov is quoted as saying . the united states has promised to support an upcoming training program for ukraine 's national guard forces . russia is under continued pressure from the west to end its support for the separatists . moscow denies claims by kiev and the west that it has trained and equipped the rebels , as well as sending russian troops to fight alongside them . in what kremlin observers may see as another sign of defiance , russia signed a treaty wednesday with georgia 's breakaway territory of south ossetia . russia sent its tanks into georgia in 2008 and subsequently encouraged separatists in its south ossetia and abkhazia regions to declare independence from tbilisi . nato secretary general jens stoltenberg condemned the `` so-called treaty on alliance and integration '' in a statement wednesday , and repeated nato 's call for russia to reverse its recognition of the territories as independent states and to withdraw its forces from georgian soil . `` this so-called treaty is yet another move by the russian federation that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region , '' he said . `` it violates georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law , osce principles and russia 's international commitments . `` it does not contribute to a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in georgia .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- incumbent goodluck jonathan phoned former military leader muhammadu buhari on tuesday to concede defeat in nigeria 's presidential elections , buhari 's party says . jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to his countrymen . `` i thank all nigerians once again for the great opportunity i was given to lead this country and assure you that i will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure , '' he said . the independent national electoral commission is still announcing the final tally in the polls , but early numbers indicate buhari , now the president-elect , has an overwhelming majority of votes . buhari ruled nigeria from late 1983 until august 1985 after ousting his predecessor in a coup . his 20-month rule was known for what he described as a `` war on indiscipline , '' a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses . the 72-year-old retired major general 's experience as a military ruler has variably been viewed as a plus or minus in present-day nigeria , where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group boko haram . his campaign has focused on security and ending corruption in nigeria . read more : who is nigeria 's muhammadu buhari ? violent protests after elections saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the united states and britain against political interference . demonstrators fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in nigeria 's oil-rich rivers state on sunday as they marched to protest the elections amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation . after the protests in rivers , buhari 's all progressives congress demanded the elections there be canceled . `` there 's been so much violence in rivers state that it 's just not tenable , '' party spokesman lai mohammed said . but the people 's democratic party disputed the accusation , saying the election was `` credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of rivers state to support president goodluck jonathan . '' both candidates took to social media to call for calm . `` i want to urge all nigerians to also wait patiently for the independent national electoral commission , inec , to collate and announce results , '' jonathan said on his facebook account . `` fellow nigerians , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced , '' buhari said on twitter . jonathan and buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to `` free , fair and credible elections '' after their signing of the abuja accord in january . in his statement tuesday , jonathan said ; `` i promised the country free and fair elections . i have kept my word . '' he advised anyone upset with the results to follow due process and stay away from further violence . `` as i have always affirmed , nobody 's ambition is worth the blood of any nigerian . the unity , stability and progress of our dear country is more important than anything else , '' he said . read more : democracy was the real winner . more than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across nigeria 's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate . nigeria 's vote had been scheduled for february 14 , but on february 7 , nigeria 's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns , with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by boko haram . the controversial decision was unpopular among many nigerians and led to widespread protests . jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat boko haram , which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of sharia law in nigeria . on saturday , residents in the northeastern state of gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations , apparently by boko haram extremists . cnn 's christian purefoy reported from lagos , nigeria , while cnn 's susannah cullinane and stephanie busari wrote from london .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- thomas muller might be a world cup winner with germany but at home he has a different title : managing director of carrots . that 's because his wife , lisa , is an aspiring dressage rider with her own designs on conquering the sport she loves . and the hours they spend at stables just outside munich seem to be paying dividends , lisa picking up her first title at national level over the weekend . while the 25-year-old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses , thomas takes a keen interest in breeding , as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to . `` i come here to watch if everything 's fine , '' he told cnn in the couple 's first joint television interview . `` and for the carrots . i 'm the managing director of carrots ! i watch the dogs . sometimes i help a little bit but it 's her business . `` i enjoy it a lot . they make me feel comfortable , the attitude and what they look like and -lsb- the way they -rsb- live their lives . it 's fun . it 's easy to relax around horses . '' at 25 , muller is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come . he has a glut of domestic trophies , including three german bundesliga titles , and claimed the european champions league and fifa club world cup crowns with bayern munich in 2013 . last year in brazil he landed the ultimate prize when germany powered its way to a first world cup triumph since 1990 , memorably beating hosts brazil 7-1 in the semis before edging past argentina in the final . but you wo n't hear much talk of that landmark moment in muller 's career around the stables . `` he 's interested in horses so when we are together we talk about horses and not really about football , '' lisa explained . `` he knows more about horses than i know about football . '' while muller has enjoyed overwhelming success at an early stage in his career , lisa 's path is a more arduous and exhaustive one . though she has been riding horses since her granddad introduced her to the sport aged four , it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage . and though her recent victory at the grand prix in the bavarian town of kreuth shows she is clearly in tune with her horse birkhofs dave , lisa says her learning curve is a lengthy one . `` you have to do eight years to learn everything but then you still do n't know everything . you always keep learning , '' she said . `` it 's not like other sports , you always train yourself , you have to get a harmony between the horse and yourself . `` it has its own mind , its own feelings . you have to become a team and that 's why it takes so much time . every horse is different so you have to feel it . `` i want to get better and better . maybe at some point i will be very good , that 's my dream . -lsb- the olympics -rsb- would be a dream . `` i think for every sportsman it 's a dream and you want to reach it but just a few people can reach it . maybe , maybe not . '' according to lisa 's coach , götz brinkmann , that is a distinct possibility . last year 's qualification for the prestigious piaff-förderpreis -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential . `` i 've never had a student that developed that fast no matter what horses they had , '' brinkmann told cnn . `` she 's got the will and she 's got the talent and she does n't stop . she keeps on working . and not so many riders have the ability and that makes her fortunate in a way . `` i think she 'll be able to be successful on an international level for sure . '' muller is of the same opinion . though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and birkhofs dave . both the couple 's disciplines rely on a high skill level , but also strong communication , and though the competition is fierce , muller has high hopes for the pair . `` the potential is there , '' he said . `` he 's our best talent i think and the number one in our stable and for lisa . `` but it 's no guarantee for success because in germany there 's a lot of opponents . a lot of good riders and a lot of good other horses . like in football . `` she has no pressure . i want that she 's happy with the horses , with the work and with the competitions . but it 's not easy . `` it 's very tough to get up in germany in the dressage sport . she needs time to develop her quality . we 're on a good way and we need to go for it . '' muller can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds , whether in racing or dressage circles , while some fall by the wayside . `` there are some talents and they grow up and go to the top , '' he said . `` and some talents do n't get to the top . `` it 's interesting to watch , the development of the different horses from when they come to the stable and when they leave . but he -lsb- birkhofs dave -rsb- stays for sure . '' muller has his own sideline at the stables too -- breeding . `` breeding is a little bit for fun , '' he explained . `` for sure i want to breed the best horse i can . but it 's difficult and a bit of luck . but i try my best to optimize . `` my dream is one day that lisa rides a horse that i bred . but that 's a long way to go . '' though she often goes to watch thomas play at bayern munich 's home stadium -- the allianz arena -- lisa does n't even remotely fit the wag stereotype . the wives and girlfriends of high-profile footballers are often portrayed as carefully manicured , fashion-obsessed shopaholics -- an image cultivated by the tabloid newspapers . but lisa , who chose not to travel with thomas to the world cup in brazil last year , has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets . `` i do n't , '' she said . `` you have the bad sides also . everyone comes and wants to get a photo , a selfie or an autograph . that would be too much . i ca n't do that like thomas can do it . `` he 's so easy going . and i want to do my horses by myself . i can groom them the best , i can ride them the best and i love them the most . `` they 're my partner , my brother . i can tell them every problem . they 're the most important part in my life . '' this statement provoked a laugh from her husband : `` i have already accepted it , '' he joked . `` maybe i 'm number five . but it 's ok . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in 1971 , a physicist conceptualized the existence of a fourth fundamental element in the electronic circuit , besides the three that were already in use at the time . his name was leon chua and he believed -- for reasons of symmetry -- that an extra component could one day be constructed to join the resistor , the capacitor and the inductor . he called it `` memristor '' , a portmanteau of the words memory and resistor . it took 37 years for our engineering abilities to catch up with that idea : the first memristor was built by hewlett packard in 2008 . and today , many researchers believe it could spark a revolution in computing . simply put , the memristor could mean the end of electronics as we know it and the beginning of a new era called `` ionics '' . the transistor , developed in 1947 , is the main component of computer chips . it functions using a flow of electrons , whereas the memristor couples the electrons with ions , or electrically charged atoms . in a transistor , once the flow of electrons is interrupted by , say , cutting the power , all information is lost . but a memristor can remember the amount of charge that was flowing through it , and much like a memory stick it will retain the data even when the power is turned off . this can pave the way for computers that will instantly turn on and off like a light bulb and never lose data : the ram , or memory , will no longer be erased when the machine is turned off , without the need to save anything to hard drives as with current technology . but memristors have another fundamental difference compared with transistors : they can escape the boundaries of binary code . initially , the technology will be mostly used to create super-fast memory chips that contain more data and consume less energy . this alone would make regular computers much more powerful , but down the line , the memristor could also take on the processing . jennifer rupp is a professor of electrochemical materials at eth zurich , and she 's working with ibm to build a memristor-based machine . memristors , she points out , function in a way that is similar to a human brain : `` unlike a transistor , which is based on binary codes , a memristor can have multi-levels . you could have several states , let 's say zero , one half , one quarter , one third , and so on , and that gives us a very powerful new perspective on how our computers may develop in the future , '' she told cnn 's nick glass . such a shift in computing methodology would allow us to create `` smart '' computers that operate in a way reminiscent of the synapses in our brains . free from the limitations of the 0s and 1s , these more powerful computers would be able to learn and make decisions , ultimately getting us one step closer to creating human-like artificial intelligence . transistors are based on silicon , a rigid material whose properties are used to manage the flow of electrons , and thus information . in 1975 , gordon moore , the co-founder of intel , formulated a famous law which states that the number of transistors in an electronic circuit doubles approximately every two years . this has so far proven accurate and set the pace for the constant increase in computing power , but the trend might soon come to an end . there is a physical limit to the number of transistors that we can pack on a chip , and we are already approaching the miniaturization threshold of this technology . it is inevitable that , one day , we will need to move away from silicon based computing . the memristor technology is a candidate for this crucial step : `` it could mean the end of the silicon era , giving us lower power consumption , the ability to compute more information , increased data storage and completely new logic patterns for our computers , '' says rupp . memristors do n't require a silicon layer and different materials can be used as a substrate . this could create a new class of microchips , that could eventually be integrated in everyday items such as windows , clothes or even coffee cups . after manufacturing the first ever memristor , hewlett packard has been working for years on a new type of computer based on the technology . according to plans , it will launch by 2020 . simply called `` the machine '' , it uses `` electrons for processing , photons for communication , and ions for storage . '' `` i think there is a race going on , '' says rupp . `` there is a strong driving force , but at the same time it 's very important that there are players like hp , because they want to get to the market , show everyone that this is real . '' at the moment , manufacturing costs are still high , but the benefits are worth it : `` memristors operate at a lower power consumption , with a faster speed , and with a higher volume density of information than anything we have based on silicon microchip transistors , '' rupp told cnn . much like a particle in the realm of physics , the existence of the memristor was theorized long before we could actually build one . now that we have that capability to manufacture it , the `` missing fourth element '' of electronics -- despite its less than catchy name -- might be the key to many further human discoveries . read more from make , create , innovate : . behold the ` internet of sheep ' will you soon be able to ` swallow the doctor ' ? meet the world 's first 1,000 mph car .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there are superyachts . and then there are superyachts for `` ladies . '' introducing la belle , the 80-meter gold and crystal-encrusted superyacht described as a floating `` boudoir for women , '' by its female designer . `` there will not be any boy 's toys -- such as pool tables or beer kegs -- on board , '' italian designer , lidia bersani , told cnn . `` but there will be a fantastic spa with a beauty center , large mirrors , and huge wardrobes , '' she said of the concept yacht , which she claims is the first designed specifically for women . bersani came up with plans for the five-deck la belle because `` i felt , as a lady , it was my duty to design something especially for us , where we can feel a woman 's touch . `` there will only be off-white , ivory , and cream colors . all surrounded by furs , silk , gold , pearls , crystals , live music , aromatics and flowers , '' she added . not that all women are on board with bersani 's `` warm and romantic '' bejeweled boat . `` i do n't know any woman who lives in a dream world where these things are desirable , '' said maria jaschok , director of the international gender studies centre at oxford university . `` it feels somehow remote , like some sort of little girlish dream , traveling in that eternal pink cloud . '' bersani , who also designs apartment interiors , defended the hyper-feminine yacht , saying : `` i do n't know a single woman who does not like flowers and is not dreaming of diamonds . `` if you get married , the most amazing day in your life , you want to be dressed in an amazing white long dress , looking like a princess , with a gold diamond ring on your finger , around romantic music , happy people , and plenty of flowers . '' in the ultra-elite world of superyachts , female owners are practically unheard of , but that does n't mean women do n't have a huge influence over the spending of their billionaire partners . `` in terms of superyacht owners , i 'd say they were upwards of 90 % male , '' said rory trahair , of superyacht brokers edmiston . `` that said , superyachts on the whole are designed for the preferences of a couple -- for their interests , design , style , and taste . `` and while the person chartering a superyacht is often male , the person in charge of the holiday is often his wife or girlfriend . '' male or female , trahair envisioned few clients looking to buy a `` radical , gold yacht '' such as bersani 's . `` it could be regarded as patronizing -- a bit like barbie , where the assumption is that everything has to be pink , '' said trahair . earlier this year , plans were revealed for world 's biggest private boat -- the $ 1 billion , 222 meter triple deuce . and they 're only going to become more lavish , according to trahair . `` we 've launched yachts in the last few years that have multiple pools , helipads , a squash court . there are few things now a yacht ca n't have , '' he said . `` whereas a jacuzzi was a luxury in the early 2000s , now if you 've got just one , it 's rather frowned upon . you need to have a few and you need to have an infinity plunge pool that doubles as a helipad . '' whether there will also be a market for gender-specific vessels , remains to be seen . photo gallery : fantastical superyachts of the future . experience : secret life of a superyacht stewardess .
atlanta -lrb- cnn -rrb- this is a tale of two storms . the one that -lrb- kind of -rrb- hit atlanta and the one that hit everywhere else . atlanta 's was anti-climactic . everywhere else was worse . ask folks along a line from arkansas to virginia . unlike last year , when city officials were caught completely by surprise , atlanta was prepared this time . but the storm stayed north of town . it did do some damage , slicking up roads and knocking out power to tens of thousands of people . still , snowmageddon 2015 it was n't . georgia gov. nathan deal did his part . he ordered a state of emergency for 51 northern counties . authorities were ready too . there were more snow plows , more trucks to spread brine and they were out in force ahead of the bad weather . and people helped out by staying home or leaving work early . still , social media was n't about to give the governor a break . `` as a stockholder of a grocery store here , i appreciate you guys invoking a false panic again . #atlsnow , '' tweeted tommy sale . north of the city , there was lots of snow , especially in the mountains , but atlanta mainly got rain . it was a disappointing prospect for those who had their hearts set on making a snowman from a rare snowfall . `` serious question , how am i supposed to build a snowman with rain ? '' asked angelica monteon . `` lol , a little imagination and your freezer , '' responded ashley hamilton . other parts of the south found enough snow to put together more than your basic snowman . in northeast mississippi they were channeling `` star wars '' and the ice planet hoth in creating a snowy version of an imperial walker . in alabama , the snow inspired a host of elsas , annas and olafs to spread their wintry magic `` frozen '' style . by early thursday , the storm system had largely left the deep south behind , instead spreading a blanket of white on the carolinas and northward . north carolina gov. pat mccrory noted that this marked the second time in two years that a major winter storm covered his entire state . there were no casualties or major injuries , thankfully , but the central part of the state got up to 7 inches while a few inches fell in the east . it was n't just that snow fell , but the type of snow -- heavy stuff that snapped branches and weighed down power lines , especially in durham and wake counties . that led to some 224,000 duke energy customers being in the dark at one point , a number that had fallen to about 78,000 by 6:25 p.m. thursday . `` the biggest issue for us , especially greensboro to the east , was power outages , '' mccrory said . `` that is something that ... we did n't anticipate . '' thankfully , though , north carolinians were ready in other ways . they heeded officials ' warnings by stocking up , staying off the roads and staying safe . the storm did leave behind its share of slippery misery . north of atlanta , interstate 75 was in gridlock wednesday afternoon . catching flights was a nightmare in some southern cities . atlanta , dallas and charlotte were the hardest hit . some 1,600 flights were canceled at all u.s. airports on wednesday . nearly 900 have been scrubbed for thursday . in alabama , joe day and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to evansville , indiana , instead of worrying with canceled flights . they did n't make it far . they were stuck on i-65 about 30 miles north of birmingham . day says a hill and snow-covered roadways led to backed-up traffic for miles . in tennessee , 30 weather-related deaths have been reported in the past 10 days . a small child died in mississippi after the car she was in hydroplaned . and a student from the university of mississippi in oxford was killed in a sledding accident wednesday . the south 's fascination with snow is a bit bemusing for those who live north of the mason-dixon line . after all , in boston , they were over winter about 70 inches ago . `` how 's the snow treating you , southern us folks ? having fun yet ? '' asked canadian l.m. murphy on twitter . `` do n't mock our southern snow panic ! '' warned whitney waddell in nashville . and then there was this bit of empathy from points north . `` i love all the snow pictures of my southern friends because they actually appreciate the snow , '' tweeted abby kreuser .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamenei on thursday accused the six world powers involved in negotiations over iran 's nuclear program of `` deception , trickery and backstabbing '' in their dealings with tehran , according to iranian state media . he also criticized a letter sent by 47 u.s. republican senators to iran 's leaders , which threatened to scupper any deal if a republican president is elected next year , iran 's official press tv reported . `` of course , i 'm concerned because the other side is into deception , trickery and backstabbing , '' khamenei is quoted as saying in a speech in tehran . he suggested that the letter was part of a u.s. strategy of last-minute reversal aimed at undermining a comprehensive deal covering iran 's nuclear ambitions , press tv said . `` this is part of their ploys and tricks , '' said khamenei . iran faces a march 24 deadline to reach a deal over its nuclear program . several interim agreements have been made in recent months , though a long-term pact so far has been elusive . the six world powers -- the united states , russia , china , the united kingdom and france , plus germany , a group known as the p5 +1 -- are seeking a deal that will ensure that iran does n't develop nuclear arms . officials in tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes , not to create atomic weaponry . the republican senators ' decision to write to iran 's leaders has stirred up a political firestorm in the united states . u.s. secretary of state john kerry denounced the letter wednesday at a senate foreign relations committee hearing , calling it a breach of `` more than two centuries of precedent '' and factually incorrect . did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? `` it purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with america , they have to negotiate with 535 members of congress , '' kerry said . `` that is both untrue and a profoundly bad suggestion to make .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- at first glance esther okade seems like a normal 10-year-old . she loves dressing up as elsa from `` frozen , '' playing with barbie dolls and going to the park or shopping . but what makes the british-nigerian youngster stand out is the fact that she 's also a university undergraduate . esther , from walsall , an industrial town in the uk 's west midlands region , is one of the country 's youngest college freshmen . the talented 10-year-old enrolled at the open university , a uk-based distance learning college , in january and is already top of the class , having recently scored 100 % in a recent exam . `` it 's so interesting . it has the type of maths i love . it 's real maths -- theories , complex numbers , all that type of stuff , '' she giggles . `` it was super easy . my mum taught me in a nice way . '' she adds : `` i want to -lrb- finish the course -rrb- in two years . then i 'm going to do my phd in financial maths when i 'm 13 . i want to have my own bank by the time i 'm 15 because i like numbers and i like people and banking is a great way to help people . '' and in case people think her parents have pushed her into starting university early , esther emphatically disagrees . `` i actually wanted to start when i was seven . but my mum was like , `` you 're too young , calm down . '' after three years of begging , mother efe finally agreed to explore the idea . a marvelous mathematical mind . esther has always jumped ahead of her peers . she sat her first math gsce exam , a british high school qualification , at ounsdale high school in wolverhampton at just six , where she received a c-grade . a year later , she outdid herself and got the a-grade she wanted . then last year she scored a b-grade when she sat the math a-level exam . esther 's mother noticed her daughter 's flair for figures shortly after she began homeschooling her at the age of three . initially , esther 's parents had enrolled her in a private school but after a few short weeks , the pair began noticing changes in the usually-vibrant youngster . efe says : `` one day we were coming back home and she burst out in tears and she said ' i do n't ever want to go back to that school -- they do n't even let me talk ! ' `` in the uk , you do n't have to start school until you are five . education is not compulsory until that age so i thought ok , we 'll be doing little things at home until then . maybe by the time she 's five she will change her mind . '' efe started by teaching basic number skills but esther was miles ahead . by four , her natural aptitude for maths had seen the eager student move on to algebra and quadratic equations . and esther is n't the only maths prodigy in the family . her younger brother isaiah , 6 , will soon be sitting his first a-level exam in june . a philanthropic family . not content with breaking barriers to attend college at just 10 years old , esther is also writing a series of math workbooks for children called `` yummy yummy algebra . '' `` it starts at a beginner level -- that 's volume one . but then there will be volume two , and volume three , and then volume four . but i 've only written the first one . `` as long as you can add or subtract , you 'll be able to do it . i want to show other children they are special , '' she says . meanwhile , esther 's parents are also trying to trail blaze their own educational journey back in nigeria . the couple have set up a foundation and are in the process of building a nursery and primary school in nigeria 's delta region -lrb- where the family are from -rrb- . named `` shakespeare 's academy , '' they hope to open the school 's doors in september . the proposed curriculum will have all the usual subjects such as english , languages , math and science , as well as more unconventional additions including morality and ethics , public speaking , entrepreneurship and etiquette . the couple say they want to emulate the teaching methods that worked for their children rather than focus on one way of learning . `` some children learn very well with kinesthetics where they learn with their hands -- when they draw they remember things . some children have extremely creative imaginations . instead of trying to make children learn one way , you teach them based on their learning style , '' explains efe . the educational facility will have a capacity of 2,000 to 2,500 students with up to 30 % of students being local children offered scholarships to attend . efe says : `` on one hand , billions of dollars worth of crude oil is pumped out from that region on a monthly basis and yet the poverty rate of the indigenous community is astronomical . '' while paul adds : '' -lrb- the region has -rrb- poor quality of nursery and primary education . so by the time the children get secondary education they have n't got a clue . they have n't developed their core skills . `` the school is designed to give children an aim so they can study for something , not just for the sake of acquiring certifications . there is an end goal .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- prince william arrived in beijing on sunday -- the first visit to china by a senior member of the british royal family in three decades -- and he might have been expecting a dose of culture shock . but chances are he 'll feel right at home . from television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock tudor housing developments , china has been embracing british culture with a passion . chinese viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like `` sherlock holmes '' and `` downton abbey , '' with the former 's star , benedict cumberbatch , so popular he has his own chinese nickname -- curly blessing . the fascination with edwardian england depicted in downton has created a growing demand for butlers , and the country 's elite are donning tweeds and taking up deer stalking . `` downton abbey depicts traditional british , high-class lives . it something that i and many other chinese are curious about , '' said student cherrie zhang . it 's not just television shows . affluent chinese parents are sending their children to british schools after some of the most notable names in british education have established campuses in china . harrow , wellington college and dulwich college have all opened sister schools in the country . and the obsession with british culture has taken a bizarre turn in thames town , a housing development on the outskirts of shanghai that resembles a quaint english town , complete with replica red telephone booths . it 's crucial that prince william capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high-profile visit , which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills . `` it will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne , '' said kerry brown , a professor of chinese politics at the university of sydney and a former british diplomat . `` and i think china will put some capital in his visit because this guy is not a politician , who come and go , but -lrb- someone who -rrb- will be around for quite a while . '' cultural exports are viewed as a growth area that the prince can promote . china spent 17 million pounds on uk tv programs and formats in 2013 , a 40 % increase on the year before , but they form a small part of the overall trade balance . and while london has been successful in attracting chinese investment , uk companies have not thrived in china the same way as some of their u.s. and german counterparts . previous trips by royals have been gaffe ridden . when the queen and prince philip spent time in china in 1986 , the queen 's husband caused offense when he told a group of british students : `` if you stay here much longer , you 'll all be slitty-eyed . '' prince charles , william 's father , has never visited china but described the country 's leaders as `` appalling old waxworks '' during his visit to hong kong in 1997 . his close ties with the dalai lama , tibet 's spiritual leader , have also angered china 's leaders . prince william will visit beijing 's forbidden city , attend the chinese premiere of the british-produced children 's animated movie `` paddington '' in shanghai and launch a campaign to celebrate british innovation during the three-day trip . before china , he is spending three days in japan . the prince will also get a chance to champion one of his favorite causes -- combating the illegal trade in wildlife -- when he visits an elephant sanctuary in southwestern china . `` if he can make some kind of link in china , if he can instinctively show he gets it , that could be an important thing , '' brown said . but the relationship between the uk and china comes laden with `` stacks of historic baggage , '' brown adds , and the prince will have to tread carefully , particularly over the former colony of hong kong , where the push for a free vote has strained ties between britain and china , the current landlords . british lawmakers were denied permission to visit the city on a `` fact-finding '' mission last year amid heated pro-democracy protests . what 's more , it 's not clear how much `` star power '' prince william has in china , especially without his glamorous wife kate , who at eight months pregnant wo n't make the trip , and his young son george . an informal survey conducted by the uk 's telegraph newspaper in beijing showed that many struggled to recognize the duke and duchess of cambridge -- one thought the couple were in the movie `` titanic '' -- and there are fears his visit will struggle to attract interest among ordinary chinese . `` the royal family are not really a big deal to me , '' said zhang , the downton abbey fan . serena dong in beijing contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- after a handful events in two months , hillary clinton has filled her march with a mix of women 's events , nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance . in january and february , clinton headlined three events -- only one of which was in the united states . but as clinton moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement , the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of march . most of clinton 's events are focused on one thing : women . clinton starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for emily 's list -- a pro-clinton organization that focused on helping democratic women win elected office . at the d.c. speech on march 3 , clinton is expected to give a nod to the group 's importance to democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics . emily 's list has been energized by clinton 's campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a clinton white house . the following week , clinton will headline two new york events tied to her 1995 speech to the u.n. fourth world conference on women in beijing -- a speech clinton regularly references in pitches to women . in that speech clinton said , `` if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference , let it be that human rights are women 's rights and women 's rights are human rights once and for all . '' on march 9 , clinton teams up with chelsea , her daughter , and melinda gates to release a report through the clinton foundation that looks at `` the gaps that still remain '' in women 's participation in the economy and politics . the following day -- on march 10 -- clinton will headline the united nation 's women empowerment principles annual gathering in new york . clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the clinton foundation report and `` reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in beijing two decades ago , '' the organizers said in a release about the event . on march 16 , clinton will be inducted into the irish america hall of fame at an event in new york . clinton is not irish -- her family is of english , scottish , french , and welsh descent -- but she is being honored because of `` her dedicated work on irish peace process . '' `` hillary rodham clinton is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the irish peace process , '' said irish america co-founder niall o'dowd . in 1998 , clinton put together the vital voices conference of women in belfast , a body that pressed for a piece agreement . the former secretary of state cited her experiences in ireland during a number of speeches in 2014 . o'dowd is a longtime clinton supporter , though , and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team . some republicans have questioned how active clinton was in the northern ireland peace process . the washington post fact checker wrote in 2008 that clinton `` seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the northern ireland peace process , which was more symbolic than substantive , '' but that she did play `` a helpful role at the margins . '' on march 19 , clinton will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to atlantic city for the american camp association , ny & nj conference . susie lupert , the group 's executive director , tells cnn , `` yes , just like most nonprofits and conferences , she is being paid for her appearance . '' but she would not confirm how much she is being paid . on average , clinton makes between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 per speech . near the end of the month , on march 23 in washington , d.c. , clinton will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the toner prize for excellence in political reporting from syracuse university . robin toner , who graduated from syracuse , was the first woman national political correspondent for the new york times . syracuse dean lorraine branham said clinton is a `` vivid example -- like robin -- of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession . '' clinton headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession . in a 1996 , according to the diary of the late clinton confidant diane blair , clinton said the media are `` complete hypocrites . '' at an event in 2014 , clinton said `` journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism . '' `` a lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual , '' she said . `` people book onto the shows , political figures , commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it 's a good show . you might not learn anything but you might be entertained and i think that 's just become an unfortunate pattern that i wish could be broken . '' clinton 's presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and democrats close to clinton expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in april .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a statue of a sitting buddha that made its way from a temple in china to a market in the netherlands revealed an extraordinary secret -- a 1,000-year-old mummified monk . the mummy was discovered , encased in a cavity in the statue , when a private buyer brought it to an expert for restoration . it 's unclear when or how the statue was removed from china . but it was n't until a team of researchers and scientists did a ct scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year , did they discover the mummy 's organs were missing . `` we thought it would be lung tissue , but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with chinese characters , '' said vincent van vilsteren , an archaeology curator from drents museum . the mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in chinese inscriptions , revealing its identity as a buddhist monk called liuquan who may have practiced `` self-mummification '' to prepare for life after death . the process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like japan , china and thailand , and was practiced over a thousand years ago . the elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots . the few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered . `` we suspect that for the first 200 years , the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a buddhist temple in china ... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue , '' said van vilsteren . researchers are still waiting on dna analysis results in hopes to trace the mummy back to its exact location in china . the statue is now housed in the national museum of natural history in budapest and will move to luxembourg in may as a part of an international tour .

'' the hashtag #llap , which stands for `` live long and prosper '' and which nimoy used to sign his tweets , was trending across several social media platforms after the news of his death . the outpouring on twitter and elsewhere left no doubt about nimoy 's indelible mark on pop culture . nimoy 's career also inspired some of the most brilliant minds in space and science . nasa posted a 1979 photo of nimoy and the `` star trek '' cast -- some sporting '70s leisure suits -- visiting the space shuttle enterprise . and then there were the ordinary fans -- trekkies , aspiring actors and science geeks who related to nimoy 's brainy spock character -- who posted personal messages and remembrances . nimoy in 2010 : `` i feel very fulfilled '' with my work . paul roth , 39 , chief information officer at chesapeake systems in baltimore , posted a teary-eyed photo using the #llap hashtag . `` leonard nimoy showed a young , nerdy , bullied me that not only could science be important and valued , but it could literally save entire ships , planets , and galaxies of lives , '' he said . `` as i grew up , he taught me that reason could be tempered with humor . that learned adults still had more to learn . that feminism and opposing prejudice was vital . and that there is no age too late to reinvent yourself . '' neil macdonald from widnes in the united kingdom wrote on instagram : `` i have been and always shall be your friend . '' and , molly desormeaux , an acting student in montreal , quebec , said : `` leonard nemoy is one of the reasons why i still believe that acting can change peoples ' lives .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- isis militants in northern syria released 19 assyrian christian hostages on sunday , according to rami abdelrahman , the chief of the london-based syrian observatory for human rights . abdelrahman has a network of activists on the ground in syria . on saturday , the observatory -- citing an assyrian commander -- said that isis planned to release 29 assyrian christian hostages . isis captured at least 220 assyrians , all christians , on february 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of tal tamer in the northern syrian province of al-hasakah . the syrian observatory said saturday that a self-proclaimed isis court ordered the release , citing an assyrian commander . the `` court '' told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped assyrians has yet to be decided by isis sharia jurists . the syrian observatory said its information indicates isis has taken the hostages to the mount abdelaziz area , southwest of tal tamer . the founder of the assyrian human rights network , osama edward , puts the number of assyrian hostages at more than 262 . edward is based in sweden but has family in the area that was attacked , and says his information is from the network 's team on the ground . the number of hostages has climbed steadily , from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on monday to 150 as of wednesday , with women , children and the elderly among them . the number of people executed by the terrorist group has also climbed steadily . since the declaration of its `` caliphate '' last june , isis has killed 1,969 people , the syrian observatory said saturday . nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians . six were children and eight were women , the group said . of the rest , 95 were fighters from the al qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-nusra front , the syrian observatory said , and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces . isis also executed 125 of its own members for `` exceeding the limits in religion , '' the syrian observatory said . `` we in sohr believe that the real number of people that had been killed by -lrb- isis -rrb- is higher than the number documented by sohr because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the -lrb- isis -rrb- jails , loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-shaitaat tribe , -lrb- and -rrb- dozens of kurds who have still been missing '' since isis attacked the syrian town of kobani in september . cnn 's samira said in abu dhabi and hamdi alkhshali in atlanta contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in his writings , author avijit roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science . he had no place for religious dogma , including from islam , the main religion of his native bangladesh . extremists resented him for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog . they threatened to kill him if he came home from the united states to visit . on thursday , someone did . as usual , roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban atlanta for dhaka , where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled `` the virus of faith . '' he has written seven books in all . as he walked back from the book fair , assailants plunged machetes and knives into roy and his wife , killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger . afterward , an islamist group `` ansar bangla-7 '' reportedly tweeted , `` target down here in bangladesh . '' investigators are proceeding on the notion that roy 's murder was an extremist attack . his father , ajay roy , filed a case of murder with the shahbagh police friday without naming suspects . no one came to their aid as they were hacked down , a witness said . `` i shouted for help from the people but nobody came to save him . '' but at night , secularist sympathizers marched through a street holding torches ; by day , others held a sit-in to protest roy 's killing . the government condemned the attack . who was the software engineer , a u.s. citizen from alpharetta , georgia , who drew such rage from some and adoration from others ? software was his career , but writing and blogging were his calling . and he did not speak alone . roy founded the religion critical blog mukto mona , which served multiple writers . he called it `` an internet congregation of freethinkers , rationalists , skeptics , atheists and humanists mainly of bengali and south asian descent who are scattered across the globe . '' its mission was to promote science , secular philosophy , democracy and religious tolerance in articles by academics and activists . its headers contain quotes by famous scientists , including one attributed to albert einstein condemning the doctrine of heaven and hell as a means of enforcing ethics : . `` a man 's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary . '' to the most devout and to extremists , roy 's criticisms amounted to blasphemy . he took aim at the sentiment in a blog post headlined , `` happy blasphemy day , happy birthday ` mukto mona . ' '' some who felt oppressed by religion said he spoke for them . `` avijit roy , your voice of reason and your passion for free thinking will never die . you were a voice to so many voiceless , '' a fan wrote after his death . very . roy and the blog 's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion , particularly islam . roy was a fan of bill maher 's harsh reproach of islam and a critic of reza aslan , who has countered maher 's standpoint . his blog called aslan `` an islamic apologist , who obviously feels threatened by the growing atheist movement in the u.s. and worldwide . '' roy likened women in burkas to `` living zombies , '' tweeting out a cartoon of one standing next to a child dressed as a ghost for halloween . yes . he began one of his final articles by writing that january 's charlie hebdo massacre in france was `` a tragic atrocity committed by soldiers of the so-called religion of peace . '' he doled out scathing criticism after another bangladeshi blogger was hacked to death outside his home in 2013 by assailants with machetes . `` the virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible , '' roy wrote . but he also criticized christianity . `` so , pope francis thinks ` evolution is real ' ! and it is still a major headline news in this century , '' he recently tweeted . to roy , god was an outdated notion . roy sought enlightenment in doubt , criticism and reason . question everything , was a theme in his online posts . never think you 've found the truth . he was a science geek who admired charles darwin , evolutionary psychology and astrophysics , according to a facebook account in his name . cnn could not independently verify it belongs to him . roy was a fan of `` cosmos , '' the tv series explaining the science behind the origin of the universe , and of the geek sitcom `` the big bang theory . '' mukto mona contains sections titled `` science '' and `` rationalism , '' but most of the articles hold science up to religion as a litmus test , which it invariably fails . `` to me , it is a rational concept to oppose any unscientific and irrational belief , '' roy said . that 's likely . he regularly attended a february book fair in the bangladeshi capital , and last year , after he launched `` the virus of faith , '' the death threats began streaming in . they landed in his email inbox and cropped up on social media . `` a well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous facebook statuses , '' roy wrote . his book `` hit the cranial nerve of islamic fundamentalists , '' roy wrote . after the charlie hebdo attacks , an online bangladeshi bookstore pulled it after extremists put pressure on it . but is seemed the author was safe in alpharetta . `` avijit roy lives in america and so , it is not possible to kill him right now . but he will be murdered when he comes back , '' the islamist wrote , according to roy . he could n't let that stop him , roy 's friend michael de dora said . `` avijit was very idealistic , '' he said . `` his understanding was that he would n't be killed , that if anyone ever tried to attack him or hated him , that they could just kind of have a chat and he would convince them ... that they could at least have a dialogue .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- brazilian police worked for five months to track down a fugitive american pastor accused of dozens of sexual assaults in minnesota . victor arden barnard , 53 , was arrested friday at a home in a gated community , said the public security secretariat of rio grande do norte state . a 33-year-old woman was detained , police said . both were transported to a federal jail in lagoa nova in natal , awaiting extradition to the united states , authorities said . barnard is suspected of 59 counts of sexual assault in minnesota . he is accused of sexually abusing two young girls who were members of his church , the u.s. marshals service said . the last u.s. sighting of barnard was last year in raymond , washington . the fugitive was featured on cnn 's `` the hunt with john walsh '' last year and again last week . barnard was featured on the u.s. marshal 's 15 most wanted list along with a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest . in addition to the sexual assault allegations , he was also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution . as a pastor , barnard inspired his congregants with his charisma and apparent devotion to the teachings of jesus christ . `` i had never met anybody that i thought loved the word of god as much as victor barnard did , '' said ruth johnson , a former member of barnard 's river road fellowship . barnard set up a so-called `` shepherd 's camp '' in the mid-1990s in pine county . several congregants moved to the rural area about 100 miles north of minneapolis to be a part of the camp . in june 2000 , the pastor allegedly convinced some members of his congregation to hand over their firstborn daughters to live with him in a secluded campsite . lindsay tornambe 's name was called , and her parents allowed their 13-year-old daughter to join the group of girls at the camp , called `` the maidens , '' under barnard 's supervision . she and other congregants said the girls got up early , sewed , cooked and cleaned . `` everything that a wife would do , they did for him , '' johnson said . barnard proclaimed he was christ on earth . `` he taught that in the bible , the church was the bride of christ and because he was christ in the flesh , the church was supposed to be married to him , '' tornambe said . `` at that time , i did n't really understand the fullness of what it meant . '' the complaint filed in minnesota says tornambe alleges she was sexually abused by barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of river road fellowship . she told investigators the group of 10 young girls and women were known as alamoths , or maidens . her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp , the document says . tornambe told investigators barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents , who had moved to pennsylvania . in fall 2011 , tornambe was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story : she said she was molested by barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20 , although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month . tornambe and the other woman went to the police in minnesota . barnard had moved to washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split , the complaint says . the ministry operated in a secluded area of pine county from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012 , chief deputy steven blackwell of the county sheriff 's office told cnn last year . the fellowship left the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry , blackwell said . afterward , the salvation army started running a family camp there . cnn 's brian walker contributed to this report .

'' the spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes , nasa said . `` crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks , '' the agency said in a release . nasa previously said the suit worn by nasa astronaut virts has a history of `` sublimator water carryover . '' water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk , causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet , nasa said . nasa said international space station managers had `` a high degree of confidence '' in the suit . on the upcoming spacewalk , virts and barry wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station . virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize . he and wilmore had been outside the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station 's robotic arm and performing some maintenance . virts immediately alerted fellow astronaut samantha cristoforetti about the water , and she alerted mission control in houston . cristoforetti helped virts out of his helmet and examined it . she confirmed the presence of moisture , mostly in the helmet absorption pad , or hap , describing it as `` wet and cold . '' at the request of mission control , anton shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet . water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups . shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet . that 's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in luca parmitano 's suit during a spacewalk in july 2013 . between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet , prompting fears parmitano could drown in his own helmet . the spacewalk was cut short , and nasa implemented some changes to its suits , including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets . there was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on december 24 , 2013 . nasa commentator rob navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as wednesday 's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock , the area from which astronauts enter and exit iss while in space .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a controversial question that 's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as jihadi john . was mohammed emwazi , the man with a british accent who 's appeared in numerous isis beheading videos , pushed toward extremism by authorities ? or was he someone who 'd long been heading down a militant path ? a london-based advocacy group that worked with emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help . and a report from the daily mail , also citing emails purportedly sent from emwazi to the british publication , said the kuwait-born londoner saw himself as a `` dead man walking '' and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities . but some analysts say the emails are only part of the story , arguing that investigators targeted emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups . `` you ca n't start the story at how he 's been treated by uk officials . you certainly ca n't start the story from the email trail , '' said rashad ali , director at the counterextremism consultancy centri and a fellow of the institute of strategic dialogue . `` you have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him . well , because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join al-shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in somalia . '' emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to cage , the human rights and muslim advocacy organization that worked with him . one email details emwazi 's account of his detention at a british airport , when authorities stopped him from traveling to kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours . `` i told them that i want to be left alone , as i have an ambition of moving from the uk and settling in kuwait . that is why i found a job and a spouse !! but they laughed , '' emwazi wrote in a message dated june 3 , 2010 . `` one of them got aggressive with me , he pushed me to the wall . ... i was just baffled i did not know why he had done that after this long 6hour interview , fingerprinting and searching . when i asked for their names they said ` we do n't give out our names . ' '' emwazi wrote that the way he was treated by british security and intelligence officials reminded him `` of criminals that you see on tv who have committed a serious crime , only i was a person never charged or arrested for anything . i was a person looking to start a new life in my country kuwait ! '' that 's a key detail , cage spokesman amandla thomas-johnson said . `` if someone is going to carry out some violent attack in any kind of way , then the law is there to be in force and apprehend them , '' he said . `` in the uk , he was n't arrested once , prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever . '' british authorities have not responded to cnn 's requests for comment on the case . in the emails , emwazi pleaded for cage 's help . `` please help me as i do n't want to stay in the uk because i have found a job in kuwait , found a spouse in kuwait and thus found a new start for my life in kuwait . kuwait is where i 'm from , i was born their . i just want to go their and start my new life again !! '' emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the independent police complaints commission , before going into detail about how he was apparently `` assaulted by the police officer '' as he attempted to leave for kuwait . but it was a difficult complaint to prove , thomas-johnson said . `` the ipcc says there 's no camera in the room where this took place , so we ca n't really do much about it except put a black mark against the officer , '' he said . `` these things happen in the shadows and the dark . so it is very difficult to independently verify once it 's taken place . there is n't much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability . '' details from court papers reported in british media paint a different picture . they say emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the `` north london boys '' who allegedly funneled money and recruits to al-shabaab . the guardian has reported that emwazi was part of a terror cell with links to the failed london bomb attacks in 2005 . to british authorities , his face was a familiar one for more than five years . but authorities lost track of him in 2013 , according to friends . he changed his name and made his way to syria . analysts who 've studied isis recruiting say they are n't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned emwazi into `` jihadi john . '' `` i think it 's an absurd claim , '' said peter neumann , director of the international centre for the study of radicalisation . `` it was not the cause of his radicalization . the reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the shabaab in somalia . '' ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism . `` people do not turn around , when harassed and have grievances , and become terrorists , '' he said . in addition to the emails released by cage , another series of emails from emwazi came to light over the weekend . the messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the daily mail 's security editor , robert verkaik . the daily mail published excerpts from those exchanges , including emwazi 's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website , but only stated his surname . when he met a potential buyer at a london underground station , he says the person he met shook his hand and said `` nice doing business with you mohammed . '' `` i never told this person my first name !! '' wrote emwazi to verkaik . '' & i never give out my first name !! it was impossible for him to know my first name !! '' he also hinted at suicidal thoughts . `` sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking , not fearing they may kill me . `` rather , fearing that one day , i 'll take as many pills as i can so that i can sleep for ever !! i just want to get away from these people !!! '' verkaik said he met emwazi in 2010 when he was investigating his claims of being harassed by police and intelligence . emwazi 's concerns bordered on paranoia , verkaik wrote , and he desperately wanted his story to be told . `` like many young muslim men at the time , he appeared to have a grievance . but this man was different , '' verkaik wrote . `` in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in syria .

caracas -lrb- cnn -rrb- venezuelan president nicolas maduro said saturday an unspecified number of americans were arrested `` a few days ago '' for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities . the president said they included an american pilot of latin american origin , arrested in the southwest border state of táchira . he said the pilot was found in possession of `` all kinds of documents '' and was being interrogated by the authorities , though he did not identify him . the venezuelan government has made many similar claims in recent years , without ever substantiating them . maduro also announced saturday a series of measures , including visa requirements for u.s. citizens and the downsizing of the u.s. embassy in caracas , to counteract what he called u.s. `` interference '' in his country . venezuela has in recent weeks accused the united states of being behind an alleged coup plot . speaking at an `` anti-imperialist '' rally in the capital , maduro said visas would now be required for all u.s. visitors and that the u.s. embassy in caracas would now need foreign ministry approval for any meetings . the embassy , which he said had more than 100 staff , is to be reduced to a number closer to the 17 venezuelan diplomats based in washington . moreover , a group of prominent u.s. officials , current and retired , will be banned from entering venezuela because of what maduro said was their involvement in `` bombing iraq , syria and vietnam '' and other `` terrorist '' actions . the officials include george w. bush , former u.s. vice president dick cheney , former cia director george tenet and several current members of congress , including ileana ros-lehtinen , bob menendez and mario diaz-balart . following the maduro 's announcement diaz-balart reacted via twitter , saying he has `` always wanted to travel to a corrupt country that is not a free democracy . and now castro 's lap dog wo n't let me ! '' the move comes after the u.s. government last month approved a law under which venezuelan officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their u.s. assets frozen . a relatively small , but noisy crowd , dressed mostly in revolutionary red , applauded and cheered the measures announced by the president from a platform outside the presidential palace in downtown caracas . four missionaries from bethel evangelical free church in devils lake , north dakota were released by venezuelan authorities on saturday , a church official said . pastor bruce dick said the missionaries arrived in venezuela on february 20 and were detained a few days ago . `` we love the venezuelan people and have served alongside them for over 12 years , '' dick said . `` we have been praying along with hundreds or thousands of others for their release and for those in venezuela who also have been affected by this . '' it is unclear if the detention and release of these americans is connected to maduro 's charges of espionage . journalist phil gunson reported from caracas . cnn 's juan carlos lopez , florencia trucco and janet digiacomo contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a chilean girl 's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen : president michelle bachelet . bachelet visited 14-year-old valentina maureira on saturday after the girl 's video went viral and spurred debate in chile about euthanasia . valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6 . her older brother died from the same disease . cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system . valentina 's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal . valentina 's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant , according to her father , freddy maureira . the teen recently posted a video on her facebook page , asking bachelet to allow her to end her life . `` i am tired of living with this sickness , '' valentina says in the video . `` please authorize an injection so i can sleep forever . '' bachelet visited valentina on saturday for more than an hour at the hospital . the country 's minister of health also attended . during the visit , the president learned details about valentina 's health , whose condition has reportedly slightly improved , cnn chile reported . the teen thanked bachelet for the visit , and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter , according to cnn chile . before the visit , the president had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl . not even the president can agree to valentina 's request because chilean law does not allow euthanasia , presidential spokesman alvaro elizaldo said . `` but what are we doing ? '' elizaldo said last week . `` the health ministry is in constant contact with valentina 's family , and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions . '' valentina 's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media . people took to facebook and twitter to discuss the debate on assisted suicide . one twitter user posed the question in a tweet : `` after the case of valentina maureira , should euthanasia be legal ? '' doctor andres castillo , chief of pediatrics at catholic university 's clinic hospital , said that at the moment , valentina 's condition is stable . '' after her diagnosis , doctors expected her to live to about 17 , which would give her three and a half more years to live .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a massachusetts teenager faces a pretrial hearing in april on involuntary manslaughter charges for allegedly sending text messages urging a friend to commit suicide , even after he expressed second thoughts , authorities said saturday . michelle carter , 18 , was indicted on february 5 . conrad roy , 18 , of fairhaven and mattapoisett , massachusetts , was found dead in his car of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning on july 13 , sgt. kevin kobza , public information officer for the fairhaven police department , said saturday . at one point the night of roy 's death , he exited the vehicle and communicated to carter that he was having second thoughts about taking his own life , kobza told cnn . carter then urged him via text message to get back in the car , kobza said . upon searching roy 's cell phone , police discovered `` hundreds '' of texts between roy and carter , many which contained language from carter that encouraged roy to take his own life , kobza said . `` instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials , ms. carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life , encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death , '' gregg miliote , director of communications for the bristol county district attorney 's office , said in a statement . carter 's lawyer , joseph cataldo , said saturday that the evidence will show this was not manslaughter and that carter attempted to console roy on `` many occasions . '' `` the facts that have been given out to the public at this point put her in the worst possible light , '' cataldo said . `` my heart goes out to the family , but this was a young man who planned this for months and months . '' on a twitter page confirmed by the district attorney 's office to be carter 's , several photos and tweets about roy have been posted since his death . one tweet reads , `` i ca n't believe today already marks 4 months without you . i love you and miss you always conrad ... '' in september 2014 , carter organized a softball tournament in roy 's memory and raised $ 2,300 for mental health awareness , according to kobza . carter was arraigned on the indictment on february 6 in new bedford juvenile court , released on $ 2,500 bail and told not to use social media , according to miliote . carter was indicted as a youthful offender because she was not yet 18 when the alleged crimes occurred . youthful offenders are tried in juvenile court but the proceedings are public , cataldo said . because of a familial relationship he has with the victim 's family , bristol county district attorney thomas quinn recused himself from the investigation and prosecution of this case , the district attorney 's office said . carter 's pretrial hearing is set for april 17 .
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- this was supposed to be a rally led by boris nemtsov , had he lived two more days to see it . but after the russian opposition figure was gunned down friday night , sunday 's rally in moscow took on a different theme . instead of gathering to criticize russia 's policies on ukraine , thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister . and as they united near the site of nemtsov 's death , conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of president vladimir putin as he walked near the kremlin with his ukrainian model companion . ukrainian president petro poroshenko added fuel to the conspiracists ' fire by saying saturday that nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to russian interests , according to ukrinform , the state-run news agency . `` a few weeks ago i had a conversation with him on how to build relations between ukraine and russia , as we would like them to be . boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the russian armed forces in ukraine . someone was very afraid of that . boris was not afraid , the executioners were afraid . they killed him , '' ukrinform quoted poroshenko as saying . russian authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally . but they agreed to allow the procession honoring nemtsov , said people 's freedom party leader mikhail kasyanov . nemtsov was a top official in the party . the 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with a companion , 23-year-old anna duritskaya , when he was killed . the model later called ilya yashin , a friend and political colleague of nemtsov 's , and said several men had pulled up in a car , and one opened fire , yashin said . russian tv station lifenews spoke with a snowplow driver , who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the slaying . he was identified as `` sergey b. '' `` i got on the bridge , looked into the rear mirror and saw a man on the ground . i immediately realized he did n't feel well . i drove a little bit further and pulled over , '' the driver said . `` i realized we needed to call the ambulance and police . '' in a statement on its website , the investigative committee for the russian federation said the shooter likely used a russian-made makarov pistol and 9 mm shells were collected at the scene . police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-9 , russia 's sputnik news agency reported . the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater . several possible motives were being investigated , the committee said , including the prospect that the shooting was a `` provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country . '' the committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the charlie hebdo terror attack in paris or nemtsov 's business activities , it said . the committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles -lrb- $ 49,000 -rrb- for information about the crime , several media outlets reported . investigators interviewed duritskaya , who was not wounded . she was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment , and ukraine 's foreign ministry has requested that duritskaya be allowed to return to ukraine , according to tass , a russian news agency . putin quickly condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said in a statement . the president also wrote to nemtsov 's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the kremlin said . but some of nemtsov 's fellow critics suspect involvement by either putin 's administration or a supporter of the president . `` it 's clearly a political murder . it 's definitely a contract one , '' yashin said . `` i do n't know who killed boris , but i know that it 's the government and personally putin who are responsible for it . they 've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who does n't support their course and thinks different . '' putin had a different theory : that the killing was a contract hit , but one meant to fire up political strife , putin 's spokesman dmitry peskov said . nemtsov himself had said he was at risk for assassination . he told the russian newspaper sobesednik last month that he was `` a little bit '' afraid his mother 's fears putin would have him killed would come true . but , he added , `` i 'm not afraid of him that much . if i was afraid i would n't be heading an opposition party and do what i 'm doing . '' last year , nemtsov spoke to cnn 's anthony bourdain . `` i 'm -lrb- a -rrb- well-known guy , and this is a safety because if something happens with me , it will be scandal not only in moscow city but throughout the world , '' he said then . critics of putin have in the past suffered miserable fates . last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russian journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya . business magnate mikhail khodorkovsky accused putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps . russian spy alexander litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put putin in power . he was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in london in 2006 . no killer has been caught . and before his death , nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government . the most recent arrests were in 2011 , when he protested the results of parliamentary elections , and in 2012 , when tens of thousands protested against putin . while nemtsov certainly had his share of enemies in russia -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the ukrainian conflict -- many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed . `` to boris nemtsov , '' one letter read , `` thank you for your example of courage and honesty . '' human rights activists did not mince words in assigning blame for nemtsov 's murder . tweeted garry kasparov , chairman of the human rights foundation 's international council : `` if you are popular your critics do n't have to be shot down in front of the kremlin . putin is just food in a prison , eat it or starve . '' in a column on how nemtsov had been harassed for his regular criticism of the kremlin , human rights watch 's tanya cooper lambasted peskov , the putin spokesman , for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize russia -- a statement cooper said could prejudice the investigation . `` russia has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president 's office , '' she wrote . `` a country in which people are told to hate one another for difference of opinions is a dangerous country to live in .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- chelsea claimed the first silverware of the english domestic season and jose mourinho 's first trophy of his second spell in charge with a 2-0 win over tottenham hotspur at wembley sunday . deflected efforts either side of halftime from chelsea captain john terry and leading scorer diego costa dashed tottenham 's hopes in the all-london league cup final . chelsea had suffered a chastening christmas defeat to the same opposition in the english premier league , with harry kane starring , but the promising young english striker was kept largely quiet in the showpiece occasion . the first half saw tottenham edge the possession and carry more of the attacking threat , with dane christian eriksen 's free kick rattling the chelsea crossbar . but chances for either side from open play were in short supply and it was from a free kick that chelsea went ahead just before the break . willian 's delivery from the right brushed danny rose 's head and fell invitingly to terry whose shot went into the net after taking a deflection off eric dier . tottenham might have felt hard done by and the sense of injustice would have deepened on 56 minutes as cesc fabregas found costa down the left and his firm strike took another wicked deflection , this time off walker , who was credited with the own goal , to leave goalkeeper hugo lloris with no chance . it seemed to take the sting out of the tottenham challenge and although kane had a late half chance , it was terry who typically snuffed out the threat with a timely tackle . it was the fifth time chelsea had lifted the english league cup and third under mourinho . the portuguese claimed it in his first season with the west london club in 2005 and after returning to the stamford bridge hot seat last season has broken his mini-trophy drought . mourinho , whose side is also well-placed to go through to the quarterfinals of the champions league , was clearly reveling in his latest success , his 21st career trophy as a manager . '' ` it is important to feel like a kid at 52 years old , '' he said . man of the match terry is hoping it will pave the way for further triumphs . `` it 's the first trophy this season and it 's massive . it meant an awful lot to us when we won it in jose 's first year in 2005 as well , '' he said . `` that could be the start of something very good . we have to kick on and we have got the league to focus on , but it 's a great day and a great win . '' man city blow . chelsea was also boosted by an earlier result in the epl as its nearest title rival manchester city was beaten 2-1 at liverpool . city had hoped to cut the gap at the top on chelsea to just two points with a win at anfield , but instead suffered a chastening reverse . jordan henderson put liverpool ahead with a thumping shot after just 11 minutes only for edin dzeko to draw city , defending the epl title , level midway through the first half . liverpool , looking to boost its own chances of champions league football next season , dominated after the break and deservedly took three points after philippe coutinho scored a superb late winner with a curling shot which flew past joe hart . arsenal stayed third by beating everton 2-0 with olivier giroud and tomas rosicky scoring late in each half to give the gunners a boost after a champions league defeat to monaco in midweek .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- victor arden barnard , an american pastor wanted for 59 counts of sexual assaults in minnesota , was arrested by brazilian authorities on friday , the office of the governor for the state of rio grande do norte said saturday . the 53-year-old suspect was wanted by the pine county , minnesota , sheriff 's office for allegedly sexually abusing two young girls who were members of his church , the u.s marshals service said . barnard -- who was featured on cnn 's `` the hunt with john walsh '' in 2014 and again earlier this week -- was last seen in the united states in raymond , washington , in 2014 . in april of that year , prosecutors in pine county , minnesota , issued a criminal complaint that accused him of 59 felony counts of criminal sexual conduct . the manhunt began after a two-year investigation into allegations from two women about barnard 's alleged conduct while he was preaching to a religious group in finlayson , minnesota . barnard was featured on the united states marshal 's 15 most wanted list along with a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest . he was also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution . a 33-year-old woman was also arrested , brazilian authorities said . as a pastor , victor barnard inspired his congregants with his charisma and apparent devotion to the teachings of jesus christ . `` i had never met anybody that i thought loved the word of god as much as victor barnard did , '' ruth johnson , a former member of barnard 's river road fellowship , told `` the hunt . '' david larsen , a former leader of the river road fellowship , said he helped barnard set up a so-called `` shepherd 's camp '' in the mid-1990s in pine county to help bring more people into the church . several of his congregants , including johnson , moved to the rural area about 100 miles north of minneapolis to be a part of the camp . in june of 2000 , the charismatic religious leader allegedly convinced some members of his congregation to hand over their firstborn daughters to live with him in the secluded campsite . lindsay tornambe 's name was called and her parents allowed their 13-year-old daughter to join the group of girls at the camp , called `` the maidens , '' under barnard 's supervision . she and other congregants said the girls got up early , sewed , cooked and cleaned for barnard . `` everything that a wife would do , they did for him , '' johnson said . barnard proclaimed he was christ on earth . `` he taught that in the bible , the church was the bride of christ and because he was christ in the flesh , the church was supposed to be married to him , '' tornambe said . `` at that time i did n't really understand the fullness of what it meant . '' the complaint filed in minnesota says tornambe alleges that she was sexually abused by barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of river road fellowship . tornambe told investigators the group of 10 young girls and women were known as alamoths , or maidens . her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp , the document says . tornambe told investigators that she estimated that barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents , who had moved to pennsylvania . in fall 2011 , she was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story : she said she was molested by barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20 , although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month . tornambe and the other woman went to the police in minnesota . barnard had moved to washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split , the complaint says . the ministry operated in a secluded area of pine county from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012 , chief deputy steven blackwell of the county sheriff 's office told cnn in 2014 . the fellowship vacated the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry , blackwell said . the salvation army now runs a family camp there , he said at the time . cnn 's florencia trucco and pierre meilhan contributed to this report .

'' dagan , who was the director of mossad from 2002 to 2010 , continued , `` i 've seen leaders who made decisions and then later admitted that they had erred . nobody is immune from mistakes . the difference between him and others is the willingness to take responsibility . he is strong on talk , not in action . '' recent polling by cnn affiliate channel 10 israel shows israelis split on the speech , with 38 % supporting it and the same percentage opposing it . the remaining 24 % are undecided . but another poll from panels politics , an israeli polling institute , indicates 53 % of israelis believe the speech will have no effect on the negotiations between six world powers and iran over tehran 's nuclear program . another 30 % believe the speech will affect the negotiations . reshef said this year 's elections , which will take place on march 17 , exactly two weeks after netanyahu 's speech , are crucial for the peace process . even after years of failed negotiations , israel has the opportunity now to restart negotiations with the help of moderate arab states , he said , while warning that going the wrong direction could push peace further out of reach . reshef would not specify which political leaders would be the best for negotiations , but he said he trusts israeli voters to decide for themselves in the upcoming elections . commanders for israel 's security is a nonpartisan group of nearly 200 veteran senior security members from the israel defense forces ; shin bet , israel 's internal security agency ; and the police . it is committed to a regional political-security initiative to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict . the group also seeks to normalize relations with moderate arab states such as egypt , saudi arabia , jordan and the united arab emirates . 6 questions about netanyahu 's visit .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- pleading innocence , immunity and ignorance , the city of cleveland responded to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by tamir rice 's family by saying the 12-year-old 's death was his own fault . in november , cleveland officer timothy loehmann fired the fatal shots at tamir within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the sixth-grader was playing with a pellet gun . in the 41-page response to the family 's lawsuit filed friday , the city says that tamir 's injuries `` were directly and proximately caused by the failure of plaintiffs ' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury . '' the response further says that `` plaintiffs ' decedent 's injuries , losses , and damages complained of , were directly and proximately caused by the acts of plaintiffs ' decedent , not this defendant . '' the city also claims it is entitled to all `` full and qualified '' immunities under state and federal law . as to the scores of other allegations in the lawsuit , the city responds by saying that they are untrue , that the independent investigation by cuyahoga county is still going on , or that the city `` is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth . '' cuyahoga county 's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy 's death constitute a crime . cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that loehmann mistook tamir 's fake gun for a real one . a witness called 911 on november 22 to say there was `` a guy with a pistol '' and that although the weapon was `` probably '' fake , tamir was scaring people . it does n't appear the dispatcher relayed the information to loehmann and officer frank garmback . video of the incident shows the two pull up on the snowy grass near a gazebo where tamir is standing . within two seconds of exiting the police car , loehmann shoots the 12-year-old . the boy died the next day of injuries to `` a major vessel , intestines and pelvis . '' in the video , neither loehmann nor garmback appears to provide medical assistance to the boy , and police chief calvin williams has said that tamir did not receive first aid until an fbi agent arrived on the scene four minutes later . an attorney for the rice family says the city 's response to the lawsuit is indicative of well-documented problems within the cleveland police department . `` the rice family maintains that tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by cleveland police officers , '' rice family co-counsel walter madison said in a statement . `` their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the cleveland police department . the rice family 's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community . '' rice family co-counsel benjamin crump said the family was `` just in disbelief '' after reading the response . crump went on to attack the police department 's assertion , put forth in december , that loehmann gave tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up . `` it is just incredible that the police officer , based on what we see on the video surveillance recording , gave tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up and drop the weapon , based on what we see in the video . it was less than 1.7 seconds . the car had n't even stopped . it 's unbelievable . '' cnn could not immediately reach the cuyahoga county sheriff 's department for comment . cleveland police department spokesperson ali pillow declined comment and referred questions to a city spokesman , who could n't be immediately reached . in december , the u.s. justice department released the results of a two-year investigation that found cleveland officers use guns , tasers , pepper spray and their fists excessively , unnecessarily or in retaliation . the police force has used unnecessary and unreasonable force at a `` significant rate , '' employing `` dangerous tactics '' that put the community at risk , the investigation stated . it was also reported in december that loehmann 's previous employer , the independence police department in a cleveland suburb , had numerous complaints about the officer , including that he was `` distracted and weepy '' and `` emotionally immature '' and had demonstrated `` a pattern of lack of maturity , indiscretion and not following instructions . '' he also showed `` dangerous loss of composure during live range training '' and an `` inability to manage personal stress , '' the department said . in december , crump called for loehmann and garmback to be charged and decried what he said was a police tendency to let grand juries determine whether to charge officers involved in shootings . in tamir 's case , he said , `` several things were done inappropriately , '' which is probable cause to charge the officers . `` there is nothing written anywhere in the law that says police officers are to be treated differently from any other citizen , '' crump said . `` we can not have children playing cops and robbers on a playground and police officers coming and claiming their lives . '' loehmann and garmback have been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation . cnn 's kristina sgueglia , catherine e. shoichet and vivian kuo contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- california 's silicon valley is one of the most prosperous places in the united states -- home to tech giants such as google , facebook and apple . yet even this region is n't immune from the scourge of child poverty . i visited silicon valley in november for cnn 's change the list series . readers of this website voted for me to do a story on child poverty . there , i found children living in tents , homeless shelters -- even a garage , which i found particularly ironic given that google and apple link their company origins to garages in this valley south of san francisco . instead of going on about all that 's wrong with silicon valley and this country as a whole , where one in five kids lives below the poverty line , i want to bring some good news : we can fix this . child poverty is n't inevitable . it 's a choice . and we can choose to end it . here are four ways we can start to do that . if you do n't like these , go to this google form -lrb- yeah , google -rrb- and suggest a solution of your own . your ideas may end up in a future column . -lrb- side note : google declined to comment on `` the poor kids of silicon valley . '' facebook and apple , meanwhile , did not respond to my repeated email requests for comment . -rrb- . the idea : housing is too expensive for poor families , especially in markets such as silicon valley . but making affordable housing more available can reduce this burden . evidence it works : increasing federal housing subsidies would reduce u.s. child poverty by 20.8 % , according to a 2015 children 's defense fund report . that would lift 2.3 million kids out of poverty . the annual cost would be $ 23.5 billion . for more info , read this report : `` ending child poverty now .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- in his first interview since islamic state militants burned alive a jordanian pilot , the king of jordan spoke to cnn 's fareed zakaria about why and how the country is going after the terror group . last december , isis captured royal jordanian air force pilot moath al-kasasbeh after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the united states-led coalition to defeat the group . for more than a month , al-kasasbeh 's family , hailing from a high-ranking tribe considered especially loyal to jordan 's royal family , implored isis to let him go . hope that he could be spared ended in early february when a video emerged showing the 29-year-old pilot in a cage , being burned alive . king abdullah ii , an instrumental supporter of the global coalition , then said jordan would be relentless in retaliating against isis . the country unleashed airstrikes . to zakaria , abdullah reiterated his commitment to stop isis . he called its fighters `` outlaws '' who twist islam and use `` intimidation '' as their biggest weapon . the king told zakaria that he did n't watch the video of the pilot 's slaying . `` i -- many of us refused to see what i think is propaganda , '' abdullah said . he felt `` disgust , sadness for the family '' and his `` heart went out to the father , the mother , the brothers , the sisters , '' the king continued . `` his wife , they 'd only been married for five months . -lrb- i felt -rrb- anger as the son of the arab army , jordanian armed forces . god bless his soul . he 's a brother in arms . `` all soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what moath was put through , '' abdullah said . during his interview with zakaria , the king repeatedly referred to isis , the islamic state of iraq and syria , as daesh . that 's an acronym for al-dawla al-islamiya al-iraq al-sham . many in the middle east prefer to use daesh because , to them , the acronym isis suggests the terror group is a legitimate state . they refuse to give the militants that much credit . `` i think if isis , or daesh as we call them , try to intimidate jordanians ... just -lrb- has -rrb- the reverse effect , '' abdullah said . `` if you look at our history , we 're a country that 's used to being outgunned and outnumbered . we 've always punched way above our weight . i think , if anything , daesh has us as a tiger by the tail . '' the pilot 's killing `` just motivated jordanians to rally around the flag , '' he said . `` the gloves have come off . '' isis is `` always trying to intimidate , scare , put fear in people 's hearts , '' the king told zakaria . `` they are trying to invent falsely a linkage to a caliphate , link to our history in islam that has no truth or bearing to our history . '' isis is recruiting `` deluded young men and women '' who `` think this is an islamic nation . '' u.s. president barack obama has caught flak for saying he did n't want to refer to isis members as islamic extremists because their actions are not islamic . `` i think he is right , '' abdullah said . `` this is something that has to be understood on a much larger platform . -lrb- isis -rrb- is looking for legitimacy -lrb- that -rrb- they have inside of islam . '' `` i 'm a muslim , '' the king said . `` these people -lrb- isis members -rrb- ... are on the fringe of islam . '' `` the barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero -lrb- the pilot -rrb- , i think , shocked the muslim world , especially jordanians and people from this region , '' abdullah said . in the wake of the pilot 's death , a jordanian government spokesman vowed an `` earthshaking retaliation . '' zakaria asked abdullah if jordan 's action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric . `` earth-shattering from all military capabilities is not something that happens overnight , '' he answered , saying that airstrikes have continued . `` there are continued operations going on in syria . we are coordinating with our friends in iraq . '' he said there is a `` long-term approach '' to fighting isis but did n't give any more details . the war against isis is as much jordan 's war as that of any other country in the coalition , he said . `` it is our war . it has been for a long time , '' he said . `` these are outlaws , in a way , of islam , the minute they set up this irresponsible caliphate to try to expand their dominion over muslims . '' isis can not argue that jordan and other muslim nations should not attack them because they 're fellow muslims , he said . the militants `` try to make themselves look as victims , '' he said . `` what about the hundreds if not thousands of muslims they have killed in syria and iraq over the past year and a half ? '' jordan has a `` responsibility to reach out to eastern syria '' and to western iraq where people have been `` executed in large numbers '' by isis , abdullah insisted . `` so this is our war , '' he said . `` we have a moral responsibility to reach out to those muslims to protect them and stop -lrb- isis -rrb- before they reach our border . '' zakaria asked abdullah what he thinks about the perception some have that syrian president bashar al-assad is interested in combating isis , meaning al-assad and abdullah have common enemies . isis has gained strength by exploiting the unrest in syria during its ongoing civil war . that war is the result of unrest in syria that originally started in 2011 within the context of the arab spring , protests for democracy or changes in government that raged in parts of the middle east and north africa in 2010 and 2011 . syrian protesters , in 2011 , wanted to bring change to the government which they said stifled expression in the harshest ways . the al-assad regime violently cracked down on the demonstrators , chaos erupted throughout syria , and eventually many on the international stage came to believe al-assad should go . the king told zakaria that the `` history of dealing with '' the al-assad regime and the `` history of dealing with '' isis are two separate things . `` what has taken prominence at the moment is isis , daesh , '' he said . abdullah rhetorically asked whether both issues can be dealt with at the same time . `` this has to be decided by the international community , '' he said . `` we believe there has to be a political solution '' in syria , and that has `` not been clarified at the moment . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a man suspected of killing two people during a `` street race '' has turned himself in to los angeles police . henry gevorgyan , 21 , surrendered to authorities saturday night in connection with the fatal hit-and-run that left two onlookers dead . he was charged sunday with murder , according to lapd spokesman officer jack richter , and held at the lapd jail in van nuys with bail set at $ 2 million . the crash happened thursday in the san fernando valley neighborhood of chatsworth . gevorgyan was driving a gray ford mustang and was allegedly racing another vehicle `` and struck several pedestrian spectators , '' police said . authorities said he fled the scene of the accident along with the driver of the other car . one man died at the scene , another died at a local hospital from his injuries . a third pedestrian is hospitalized in stable condition . `` many view this as an entertainment , glamorous activity . i think it 's important for the public to know that this is illegal , dangerous and an all too deadly activity , '' capt. john mcmahon told cnn affiliate kcal/kcbs . video from the scene showed the smashed mustang on a sidewalk . the car reportedly spun 180 degrees before landing between a fire hydrant and a utility pole . the driver of the other vehicle involved in the crash has not been found .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- after spending much of her 2008 campaign seemingly running away from the fact that she is a woman , hillary clinton is showing signs that 2016 is going to be a different story . it seems that hillary has found her outer woman , which is to say , she 's found the person that she wants to present on the campaign trail , and that person is resolutely female . this time she seems to have decided to fully embrace her womanhood as an asset in her quest for the white house and to trust that the voters will do the same . of course , hillary has n't officially announced that she will be running for president -- and universal studios has not officially announced that there will be a sequel to the blockbuster `` 50 shades of grey . '' but it 's hard to imagine 2016 happening without both of those things , seeing as how they both have such excellent prospects of success . hillary recently spoke at a silicon valley conference for women in the tech field with the theme of `` lead on . '' that lent itself nicely to the professional goals of the members of the audience as well as to hillary 's own leadership goals . she spoke of the dearth of women not only in the tech field , but in the ranks of fortune 500 ceo 's . in fact , one recent diversity study found that the major s&p 1500 company boards had more men with the name john , robert , william , or james on them than women of any name combined . left unsaid in her speech was any reference to the complete lack of a female occupant of the oval office thus far , but the thought could not have been far from anyone 's mind , let alone hillary 's . clinton was comfortable talking at length about her own experiences being pregnant and giving birth while working as a partner in a law firm , and using that as a launching pad to discuss the importance of women in the workforce both here and around the world . and from there she highlighted her own work on behalf of the women of the world as secretary of state . she segued into the discussion of the plight of working middle-class families that will be so central to the 2016 race , and the centrality of women 's economic issues to those struggles of the middle-class . from there it was a natural progression to talking about 21st century families and the importance of things such as paid leave . and all of that dovetailed perfectly into closing remarks about the future that revolved naturally around the birth in september of clinton 's first grandchild , charlotte clinton mezvinsky . that brought up hillary 's new role as a grandmother , and the perspective it has given her on the future and what needs to be done to guarantee that it 's the best possible future . the silicon valley address could serve as a template for how clinton intends to approach her career goals from the vantage point of being a woman seeking her own place in the workforce . in the coming weeks , which serendipitously happen to be part of women 's history month , hillary 's speaking schedule is heavy with events and gatherings that center around women . if she 's not running for president , then she could be gearing up to get a talk show on the lifetime network . all of which stands in stark contrast to hillary 's last presidential campaign . in 2008 , she seemed to think that she had to reassure voters that a woman could be president , primarily by not accentuating the fact that she was a woman . this time around , there seems to be a shared assumption that , of course , a woman would make an excellent president , in part simply by virtue of being a woman . in that previous campaign , hillary ran as the most experienced candidate , primarily to draw a distinction between herself and her relatively less experienced challenger , barack obama . but now , almost eight years later , clinton can let her experience speak for itself . she has more of it -- almost too much , from one perspective : she 'll be 69 by the time the 2016 election takes place . so this time instead of highlighting her experience , she 's highlighting the experiences she has in common with the women , mothers and grandmothers out there . of course , hillary 's message will have to resonate beyond female voters . fortunately , the dynamics of the 21st century economy and the place of the family within it lend themselves to a family-friendly feminism . we live in a society where women are necessary breadwinners whose income is counted upon for families to make it . gender pay equality and supportive work environments benefit spouses , children , extended families and entire communities . today , feminism , family and economic issues intertwine like never before . hillary 's stressing of the importance of women 's workplace issues both to the family and to the struggles of the middle-class puts the republicans on the defensive as they try to co-opt middle-class economic issues . potential gop presidential candidates are already trying to position themselves to steal the thunder of the democratic nominee when it comes to issues of wage inequality and middle-class stagnation . but how exactly do they propose to reinvigorate a middle-class that is overwhelmingly composed of families with two wage-earners if they do n't fight for women 's workplace issues ? for instance , child care may be thought of as a woman 's issue , but it 's really a family issue , virtually by definition , and an economic issue on top of that . among topics that are sometimes seen as more traditional women 's issues such as family planning , access to birth control and the right to choose , hillary has the advantage in that she can make her stance clear , based on her life experiences as a woman . it 's the republicans with extremist views on these issues who have to dance around their real beliefs and avoid making outrageous and absurd statements such as embarrassing pronouncements about rape and pregnancy . if hillary seems more comfortable running as a woman , it 's partly because society at large seems more comfortable with a populist-tinged feminism than it was in 2008 . patricia arquette 's oscar night speech in support of equal pay for women -- although predictably dismissed by right-wing media such as fox news -- was enthusiastically received by the public in general . in fact , far from being thought radical , arquette 's statements backstage were thoroughly deconstructed by the left for not being progressively correct enough . women have been steadily making strides in the years since hillary 's 2008 campaign , and as they did , they smoothed the way for one of their own to run for the highest office in the land without having to play down her gender . hillary is now wisely embracing her gender as a way of capturing the same `` hope and change '' historical quality of obama 's presidency . voters always want change , and hillary clinton has been a constant on the political stage for decades now . she 's certainly no stranger to washington , or to the west wing of the white house . but electing her president would still represent massive change on a fundamental level . hillary clinton wants 2016 to be the year of the woman . and she wants to be the woman .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a volcano in russia led to the cancellation of flights in alaska over the weekend . `` we canceled two roundtrip flights between anchorage and bethel , and anchorage and nome after an advisory of low visibility , '' alaska airlines spokeswoman halley knigge said . ash from russia 's shiveluch volcano was the culprit behind the flight disruptions saturday , said jeff freymueller , a scientist at the alaska volcano observatory . the volcano erupted friday , shooting ash into the atmosphere some 30,000 feet . winds blew the ash cloud across the bering sea and into western alaska , freymueller said . shiveluch , which has been erupting consistently , caused a similar incident in january , he said . the airline will only operate flights when it 's safe to do so and will not fly into areas of reported ash . alaska airlines was uncertain if additional flights would be canceled , but said it 's monitoring the situation . three volcanoes are erupting on russia 's kamchatka peninsula : shiveluch , klyuchevskoy and karymsky . volcano grows japanese island .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama 's effort to bridge the trust deficit between african-americans and law enforcement , the money wars heading into 2016 , a little cpac history and a `` do not reply '' mandate fill our sunday trip around the `` inside politics '' table : . 1 . winning cpac once meant little , but are rand paul 's multiple wins just the ticket ? rand paul won his third consecutive cpac presidential straw poll this weekend , and most political journalists yawned -- and understandably so . there have been 20 previous cpac straw polls , and only in four of those cases has the winner ended up as the republican presidential nominee . and in all four of those cases , it was in the actual election year . never has a winner in the year before the presidential vote -- like this year -- gone on to win the nomination . so sen. paul should n't rush to measure the white house drapes . but he is now in special company : he 's in a tie for cpac wins -lrb- three -rrb- with ronald reagan and jack kemp . mitt romney is the all-time leader with four cpac wins . ron paul has two . so winning once is more or less meaningless , but winning twice or more ? the pauls -- rand and ron -- are the only two men with at least two cpac wins who have not appeared on the gop ticket . -lrb- kemp was bob dole 's vp nominee . -rrb- . it 's one more way , we can assume , that rand paul hopes to get some separation from his dad heading into 2016 . 2 . potus hopes for action -- and legacy item -- in law enforcement arena . washington will be consumed this week with prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's speech to congress and the continuing fight over funding the department of homeland security . but nia-malika henderson of the washington post took us inside another big event : a report from the task force obama established post-ferguson to study the tensions between law enforcement and african-americans . `` the white house has said that they have been surprised by so many areas of commonality between these activists and law enforcement officials who were on this task force , '' said henderson . `` other people say the gulf is as wide as you might imagine . '' henderson adds that the president does n't want this report to gather dust on the shelf but casts doubts over whether this will be part of obama 's record . `` whether or not it will be a legacy item , we 'll have to see . that will probably depend on legislation , and that seems fairly unlikely . '' 3 . the super pac campaign : millions are ok , but billions rule . there is always a money race in presidential politics . but the times are changing . candidates need to raise cash for their actual campaign committees , but that effort is taking a back seat to the bigger money chase . jonathan martin of the new york times shared some reporting on the race to win over big -- as in billionaire -- support for the super pacs that now dominate the world of political finance . martin noted it 's march 1 , and `` not a single candidate has set up an actual campaign committee . '' `` they have , though , set up super pacs , and this has dramatically changed politics . the donors most coveted now are billionaires with a ` b , ' those -lsb- who -rsb- can stroke seven - , eight-figure checks and the year of the bundlers who can raise a few hundred thousand dollars is seemingly passe . '' 4 . go west : the states are blue , but the money chase is bipartisan . it 's not really a risk to say california , oregon and washington will go blue -- democratic -- in the 2016 presidential race . so why , then , are many republican hopefuls heading west , especially to silicon valley ? it 's all about the cash . obama dominated high-tech fundraising in 2008 and 2012 . bloomberg 's lisa lerer traveled west recently as hillary clinton made a pitch for help this time around . she reports that clinton has many friends , but that there is a fierce and bipartisan competition for money out west . `` this time she 'll ... have competition from an unlikely source , rand paul , who 's opened an office there . he 's hoping to tap into the libertarian vein of some of the silicon valley money . jeb bush has also been meeting with tech executives . '' `` it 's not clear who 's going capture this new and growing source of wealth for elections that are supposed to cost over $ 1 billion on each side , but one thing 's sure . we 'll see lots of candidates and staffers making many trips down the 101 . '' 5 . do not reply : your government 's guide to a partial shutdown . a temporary fix keeps the department of homeland security running at full steam this week , but congress will be trying to find a longer-term solution next . so department workers still have to prepare and sort out whether they would have to work -- or would be furloughed -- in the event funding expires . ed o'keefe of the washington post gave us a glimpse at the contingency planning , obtaining a memo sent to relevant workers as it appeared congress might not reach even a temporary deal before the friday night deadline . `` buried deep in there on page 23 -- a little note to the 15 % of dhs workers who might have been furloughed : you can check your email but you can not hit reply , '' said o'keefe . `` you were allowed to check for the status of the furlough but to hit reply or to engage anyone on email might result in severe penalties . '' `` so you would get paid after a shutdown , but you were n't allowed to check your email . perhaps a silver lining to the possibility of the shutdown . ''

-lrb- cnn -rrb- cleveland 's mayor apologized monday for the city 's `` poor use of words and our insensitivity '' in the tamir rice case . mayor frank jackson told reporters the city was apologizing to the rice family and the people of cleveland for the wording of a legal filing last week , which said the death of tamir , a 12-year-old who was shot by police in november , was the sixth-grader 's own fault . `` we did something that ... is hurtful to the family , that is disrespectful to them and the victim as well as the city of cleveland , '' he said . the wording in the legal filing , jackson said , was standard language used in legal defense , and the insensitivity `` was not intended . '' but now , he said , the city will be rewording its filing -- a decision he pushed for as soon as he found out about it . `` what i care about right now is that the family of tamir rice and the people of the city of cleveland understand and realize that we are sorry for what we have done and that we apologize to them , '' jackson said . benjamin crump , an attorney for the rice family , said the mayor 's apology did n't go far enough . `` i do n't want him just to apologize for the poor word use and the grammatical phrases , '' crump told cnn 's `` the lead with jake tapper '' on monday . `` i want him to apologize for the death of this 12-year-old child , one of his citizens , at the hands of what we believe were police officers who were improperly trained . '' cleveland police officer timothy loehmann fired the fatal shots at tamir in november within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the 12-year-old was playing with a pellet gun . `` they never even gave him a chance , '' tamir 's mother , samaria rice , told cnn 's `` erin burnett outfront . '' the whole world has seen the same video like i 've seen , and i 'm sure the whole world is saying , ` you guys never gave him a chance . ' with that being said , it can never be justified . '' cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that loehmann mistook tamir 's fake gun for a real one . cuyahoga county 's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy 's death constitute a crime . in its 41-page response to the family 's lawsuit filed friday , the city says that tamir 's injuries `` were directly and proximately caused by the failure of plaintiffs ' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury . '' the response further says that `` plaintiffs ' decedent 's injuries , losses , and damages complained of , were directly and proximately caused by the acts of plaintiffs ' decedent , not this defendant . '' another attorney for the rice family has said the city 's response to the lawsuit last week was indicative of well-documented problems within the cleveland police department . `` the rice family maintains that tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by cleveland police officers , '' rice family co-counsel walter madison said in a statement . `` their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the cleveland police department . the rice family 's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- for the second time , a georgia woman 's execution has been postponed -- this time because of concerns about the drugs to be used . kelly renee gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. et monday . `` prior to the execution , the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency . the drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits , '' the georgia department of corrections said in a statement . `` within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution , the execution team performed the necessary checks . at that time , the drugs appeared cloudy . the department of corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist , and in an abundance of caution , inmate gissendaner 's execution has been postponed . '' the 47-year-old was originally scheduled to die on wednesday , but that execution was called off because of winter weather . a petition saying the mother of three has turned her life around , even earning a theology degree while in prison , had garnered about 80,000 signatures as of tuesday morning . organizers plan to deliver it to gov. nathan deal , though in georgia , the governor has no authority to grant clemency . gissendaner has become a `` powerful voice for good , '' the petition says of the woman convicted of orchestrating her husband 's death in 1997 . `` while incarcerated , she has been a pastoral presence to many , teaching , preaching and living a life of purpose , '' the petition states . `` kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope . she is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce . '' on sunday night , about 200 people attended a vigil at emory university 's cannon chapel , where they sang her praises . `` killing her is not going to bring anything back . it 's not going to undo what 's been done , '' priest kelly zappa told cnn affiliate wsb . the pleas did not sway georgia 's high court or its board of pardons . in a 5-2 decision monday afternoon , the state supreme court denied her request for a stay , and it also dismissed a constitutional challenge claiming that her sentence was disproportionate . and the state board of pardons and paroles said monday evening that its decision last week to deny clemency in the case stands . not since lena baker , an african-american convicted of murder and pardoned decades later , has georgia executed a woman . the state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak last week before gissendaner 's execution was first postponed . just hours before she was scheduled to die by injection at the georgia diagnostic and classification state prison in jackson last wednesday , the georgia department of corrections announced it had postponed the execution until monday at 7 p.m. `` due to weather and associated scheduling issues , '' department spokeswoman gwendolyn hogan said . gissendaner was convicted in a february 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban atlanta . she was romantically involved with gregory owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband , douglas gissendaner , killed , according to court testimony . owen wanted kelly gissendaner to file for a divorce , but she was concerned that her husband would `` not leave her alone if she simply divorced him , '' court documents said . the gissendaners had already divorced once , in 1993 , and they remarried in 1995 . details of the crime , as laid out at trial and provided by georgia attorney general sam olens , are as follows : . kelly gissendaner and owen planned the murder for months . on february 7 , 1997 , she dropped owen off at her home , gave him a nightstick and hunting knife , and went out dancing with girlfriends . douglas gissendaner also spent the evening away from home , going to a church friend 's house to work on cars . owen lay in wait until he returned . when douglas gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m. , owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of gwinnett county . there , owen ordered his victim into the woods , took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery , hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed douglas gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times . kelly gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place , but she did not immediately get out of her car . she later checked to make sure her husband was dead , then owen followed her in douglas gissendaner 's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that kelly gissendaner had left for him . owen set her husband 's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with kelly gissendaner . police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder but did not find the body . authorities kicked off a search . kelly gissendaner , meanwhile , went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband 's whereabouts . her and owen 's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews . on february 20 , douglas gissendaner 's face-down body was found about a mile from his car . an autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck , but the medical examiner could n't tell which strike killed douglas gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck . on february 24 , owen confessed to the killing and implicated kelly gissendaner , who was arrested the next day and charged . while in jail awaiting trial , kelly gissendaner grew angry when she heard that owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder . -lrb- owen is serving life in prison at a facility in davisboro , according to georgia department of corrections records . -rrb- . she began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint . she asked her cellmate , laura mcduffie , to find someone willing to do the job for $ 10,000 , and mcduffie turned kelly gissendaner 's letters over to authorities via her attorney . kelly gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals , the attorney general said in a statement last week . in the clemency application , gissendaner 's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than owen , who actually did the killing . both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial : life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years . owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend . gissendaner was willing to plead guilty , her current lawyers said , but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole . according to her clemency appeal , her lead trial attorney , edwin wilson , said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death `` because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill doug . ... i should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because i thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted . '' her appeal lawyers also argued that gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions , become a model inmate and grown spiritually . they said her death would cause further hardship for her children . for her last meal , she requested an extravagant one : two burger king whoppers with cheese -lrb- with everything -rrb- , two large orders of fries , popcorn , cornbread , a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes , bell peppers , onions , carrots , cheese , boiled eggs and newman 's own buttermilk dressing , the corrections department said . she also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert . according to the death penalty information center : . • between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences were imposed upon female offenders . these sentences constitute about 2 % of all death sentences . • five states -- north carolina , florida , california , ohio and texas -- account for over half of all such sentences . • as of december 31 , 2012 , there were 61 women on death row . • women on death row range in age from 28 to 79 . they have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years . currently the only woman on georgia 's death row , gissendaner would be the second woman in the state 's history to be executed . the first was baker , an african-american maid who was sentenced to death by an all-white , all-male jury in 1944 . she claimed self-defense for killing a man who held her against her will , threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired a fatal shot . sixty years after her execution , georgia 's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that `` it was a grievous error to deny -lrb- her -rrb- clemency . '' such pardons are rare , but so are executions of women . according to the death penalty information center , only 15 women have been executed in the united states since 1977 . cnn 's holly yan , tina burnside , greg botelho , tristan smith and john murgatroyd contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- rafael nadal lifted his first trophy since last year 's french open and closed in on a long-standing atp tour record sunday by claiming the argentina open crown . argentina legend guillermo vilas leads the way with 49 wins in clay-court tournaments , but today 's `` king of clay '' drew nearer to the leading mark by winning his 46th title in buenos aires . he also claimed his 65th title from 93 tour-level finals , breaking out of a tie with legends pete sampras and bjorn borg for fifth place in the all-time list . nadal has been hampered by injury and illness since his roland garros triumph last june and lost out to fabio fognini in the semifinals of the rio open last week . it was a dispiriting defeat -- his first in a clay-court semifinal for 12 years -- but , moving from brazil to argentina , the spaniard was largely untroubled in reaching the final and duly swept aside home player juan monaco 6-4 6-1 in the estadio billoch caride . nadal was playing in the first event for the first time in 10 years and his victory is a morale-booster after going out early in qatar and exiting the australian open ahead of his clay-court swing in south america . the 28-year-old from mallorca took his career record against monaco , who was playing his 20th career final , to 6-1 and was never seriously troubled in the title match . the only thing to delay him was multiple rain delays which had the players scurrying on and off the court . a single break of service gave him the opener but he pulled clear immediately in the second and three further breaks saw him wrap up victory in just short of an hour and a half of action . nadal is the seventh successive spanish winner of the atp 250 event , and it is a boost for his preparations for his challenge for a remarkable 10th french open title in may .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i think back to 56 years ago : what if ? if my father had not been brave and hungry for a better future in america , there would be one fewer public administrator , one fewer third grade teacher and one fewer student in medical school in my family . had so many young people not given their youth , their energy , their strength and their love for this country , the america we know would not exist . i owe the america i know to my father and the many men that toiled long ago in the fields of our past . i owe my success to my father herminio , mother juanita and countless others that dreamed of a better tomorrow . they dreamed of a better tomorrow never knowing if they would reap the slightest of benefits from their hard work . today i stand as a testimony to that dream . as a teenager , my father left his life of poverty in mexico for the promise of a new life in the united states in 1959 . the hard , physical work of picking crops in the fields of california , arizona and texas , earned him less than a dollar a day , once room and board was subtracted . the braceros program granted him a work visa and when he finished the program , he began his path to citizenship . my father did not complete any formal education past fourth grade . in that era in mexico , you had to pay for school past a certain grade and my father 's family could n't afford it . he was limited to menial work and low wages . unlike my father , i was n't born into a life destined for backbreaking labor . my dad brought us into a world with endless possibilities . the sky was truly the limit and for the first time in his life , my father had hope -- for us . our upbringing was humble , but my parents provided for all 12 of us children . they taught each and every one of us the importance of education . our childhood was filled with the joys of love , laughter and belief in god . my father created paradise in a modest , two-bedroom home in the inner city of san antonio , texas . our eggs came fresh every morning from the miniature chickens we raised . we were raised to live off the land , just like our father did as a younger man . we had a goat , a turkey , a potbelly pig , ducks , geese and chickens . many of my fondest memories were of feeding and tending to our animals . one would assume that we lived on a farm . but balancing a life of dual identities was not an easy feat for either my siblings or me . i recall having to wake up early on sunday mornings to feed the chickens and collect the eggs , while my friends were going to the zoo , water park or the mall . when mondays came around , i dreaded talking about what i did that weekend . i did n't want to be judged , so i always made something up . the frustration of not being able to fit in gave way when i started getting positive feedback at school . i was outperforming my peers in english and writing , and i was finally getting recognition by my teachers and classmates . i felt that i finally was doing something like everyone else . i excelled at school . i decided to take a chance and apply for college . i started at the university of texas at san antonio in fall 2002 and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in english and a master 's in public administration . i was the first in my family to get a college degree -- i 'm the seventh out of 12 children . all of my siblings after me went to college and today we have a public administrator , a teacher and a medical school student in the family . now , i work in an urban school district as a site coordinator for the federal initiative gaining early awareness and readiness for undergraduate programs . the program sets out to make a college education a reality for underrepresented students and communities experiencing high poverty . i work to remove those barriers so that every one of my students has a chance at a life like the one that was given to me by my parents . i have given myself to a life of service . i am now responsible for helping many young children reach their potential and live a life our ancestors could only dream of . i am the dream . i am an american . and i am the proud son of an immigrant . are you a first-generation american ? share your story with cnn ireport .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- waiting for benjamin netanyahu to arrive at ben gurion airport , there was a whole winston churchill aspect to it all . many israeli analysts believe netanyahu sees his speech to congress warning of the dangers of a nuclear iran akin to that of the late british prime minister 's famous address to parliament in 1939 warning of the pending danger of nazi germany . indeed on the tarmac , netanyahu , with his wife , sara , at his side , somberly declared his visit to washington a `` crucial '' and `` historic '' trip and himself the `` messenger '' of all the israeli people , even those who do n't agree with him . `` i fear for the fate of the state of israel and therefore i will do everything i can to ensure the security of our future , '' he told reporters before boarding . 6 questions about netanyahu 's trip . in the days leading up to the trip , netanyahu laid the symbolism for embarking on what aides believe he views as his date with destiny , starting with a visit to the grave of his father , who he often says warned him about the dangers of missing threats to the jewish people before it is too late . on the eve of his trip , he vistied the western wall , the holiest site of judaism . there netanyahu declared his solemn obligation to protect israel , saying `` we must unite '' against the nuclear deal shaping up with iran `` that could endanger our very existence . '' on board the el-al 767 to washington , netanayhu holed himself up with aides working on his speech . a pilot told us he heard the prime minister several times yelling from the cabin , `` no , no -- stronger , stronger . '' i sat in the back cabin with about 50 journalists -- print reporters , tv correspondents and crews and photographers . i 'm told that 's about double the number of press who normally travel with him . obama and netanyahu : a clash of world views . with 12 hours to kill , the journalists chatted about bibi , the visit and how his planned address to congress has morphed into an international showdown of mythic proportions . we even found the movies on the plane steeped in symbolism : `` the imitation game '' -- an academy award-winning story about how a lone genius mathematician defeated all odds to crack nazi codes and help save europe from hitler 's grasp . then there was `` the hunger games : mockingjay , part 1 '' a tale of a group of oppressed people led by a brave revolutionary who hopes good will triumph over evil . okay , maybe that `` s a stretch . i did say it was a very long flight . bibi , as he is called , never came back . officials traveling with him said it was because he was busy with the speech . i never thought i would come to appreciate the access the american diplomatic press corps gets aboard the secretary of state 's plane . a senior official did come back to brief the reporters just before landing , telling us the prime minister would be laying out the details he understands to be part of the nuclear deal shaping up with iran and urge congress to press the obama administration to push back the march 24 deadline for a political framework . netanyahu , the official said , saw the speech as a `` last chance '' to avert a bad deal with iran , which could threaten israel 's future . we arrived at andrews air force base to a snowy evening and took the motorcade to washington . time will tell if this was indeed a historic flight or a flight of fancy .

'' the wisdom and wit of 13-year-old jewish schoolgirl anne frank , written while hiding in amsterdam during the second world war , is one of the most widely-read books in the world with over 30 million copies sold . her story of life under german occupation is a powerful record that has been translated into 67 languages and adapted for both film and theater , with her home itself turned into a museum . frank died in the bergen-belsen concentration camp in 1945 , just weeks before it was liberated . french existentialist philosopher simone de beauvoir 's 1949 book `` the second sex '' became a landmark feminist work . it analyzed the treatment and perception of women throughout history , and was deemed so controversial that the vatican put in on the index of prohibited books . `` all oppression creates a state of war ; this is no exception , '' said de beauvoir , who along with partner jean paul sartre was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century . british chemist and x-ray crystallographer rosalind franklin 's research was key in revealing the structure of dna . her x-ray photographs of the double helix were used by scientists francis crick , james watson , and maurice wilkins , who in 1962 were jointly awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on the dna model . however franklin missed out on a nobel prize herself , dying from ovarian cancer in 1958 at 37 . american billie jean king was one of the greatest competitors wimbledon had ever seen , taking home a whopping 20 titles . but she is perhaps best known for a one-off match dubbed `` the battle of sexes '' against bobby riggs in 1973 . the bespectacled 29-year-old king beat 55-year-old riggs in front of a worldwide television audience of 50 million . she later went on to form the women 's tennis association and has campaigned for equal prize money for female players . `` when we plant trees , we plant the seeds of peace and hope , '' said 2004 nobel peace prize winning environmentalist wangari maathai . the kenyan political activist founded the green belt movement in 1977 in an effort to empower rural women who had started reporting their streams were drying up , their food supply was less secure , and they had to walk further than ever before for firewood . the movement has since spread across the world , campaigning on climate change and teaming up with the united nations environment programme . this is by no means the definitive list of women who changed the world , and narrowing it down to just seven was a tough call . who would you include ? leave your suggestions in the comments box below .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- riding the crisp green waves that break into a whirl of foam on costa rica 's pacific shore , rupert hill looks like he could surf before he could walk . however , for the 37-year-old owner of surf simply , a surfing resort in nosara , the sport was an early love that blossomed later in life . he first paddled out to the big blue when he was a teenager , but his professional life took a different turn when he embarked on a fine art degree in london . in the end , the pull of the waves was too strong and hill decamped to costa rica with a goal to create a surfing school with a difference . `` i wanted to create a really intimate space that was a long way away from the putting the lots of people in the water kind of business model that surf schools often are . i wanted to just have a few people , 12 people each week , and then this area is somewhere where they can completely decompress and just focus on being coached how to surf better , '' he says . a large chunk of the school 's training is devoted to theory classes , and hill also films his students while they 're surfing so that he can show them what aspects of their technique they need to improve : `` the first time you see yourself surfing , it 's kind of mortifying . it 's a little bit like hearing yourself sing for the first time . but , like most sports , it 's the best coaching tool we have , '' he says . hill 's fine art credentials have not gone to waste though , as his creative training helped him design the website as well as the resort logo . while following his passion for surfing was important , hill stresses that figuring out how to make money out of it was equally significant . `` the business side of it has to work , the numbers have to make sense . otherwise , what you 've got is a brilliant hobby that 's not a business , '' he says . hill says that , while he feels fortunate that his work fulfills him , it still involves ordinary tasks that can sometimes be mundane . `` i do n't think anyone is going to find a job that they love all the time , but if you can find something that you love most of the time , you 're luckier than most people in the world .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- in 1796 , in his final annual address to congress , president george washington called for the creation of : . '' ... a national university ; and also a military academy . the desirableness of both these institutions , has so constantly increased with every new view i have taken of the subject , that i can not omit the opportunity of once for all , recalling your attention to them . '' the military academy was soon built at west point . but despite leaving $ 22,222 for its establishment -lrb- a lot of money back then -rrb- in his last will and testament , washington 's national university never came to pass . instead , lawmakers chose to rely on state governments and religious denominations to build and finance new colleges and universities . today , the american higher education system is in crisis . the price of college has grown astronomically , forcing students and parents to take out loans that now exceed $ 1.2 trillion in outstanding debt . many of those loans are falling into default as graduates struggle to find work . the latest research suggests that our vaunted universities are producing graduates who have n't learned very much . the time has come to revive george washington 's great idea , in 21st century form . advances in information technology that would have seemed like pure magic in colonial times mean we can now create a 21st century national university that will help millions of students get a high-quality , low-cost college education -- without hiring any professors , building any buildings or costing the taxpayers a dime . to see how , it helps to understand the three ways the federal government currently supports higher education . two of them are well known . first , the defense department , national institutes of health , and other federal agencies spend hundreds of billions of dollars financing university-based research , contributing to countless scientific breakthroughs and commercial innovations . second , the u.s. department of education provides $ 150 billion annually in grants and loans to help students pay for college . as tuitions rise and states continue to slash funding for public universities -lrb- wisconsin gov. scott walker recently proposed $ 300 million in new cuts -rrb- , the federal government has become the college financier of last resort . but there is a third essential federal role in higher education that is far less well known . in many ways , it 's the most important of them all , and the key to creating a 21st century national university . in addition to funding colleges , the federal government approves colleges . it does this through a little-understood process called accreditation . to be eligible for those billions of research and financial aid dollars , colleges must be accredited . technically , accreditors are nonprofit organizations run by consortia of existing colleges . but in order to make a college eligible for federal money , accreditors must first be approved by the federal government . without that approval and the money that goes along with it , both colleges and accreditors would immediately close up shop . in other words , uncle sam ultimately decides who gets to be an american college and grant college degrees . so , here 's the big idea : in order to build a 21st century national university , all the federal government has to do is something very simple : approve itself . in george washington 's days , this would have been only the first step of a process subsequently involving the construction of an actual university . doing this today would accomplish little in solving the higher education crisis , because physical universities cost billions of dollars to construct from scratch and can still only enroll a handful of the many students who ca n't afford a good education . fortunately , there 's no need for new buildings -- or , for that matter , administrators , libraries , faculty , and all the rest . existing colleges and universities , flush with federal dollars , have already created all the essential building blocks for national u. anyone with an internet connection can log on to coursera , edx , saylor.org , and many other websites offering high-quality online courses , created by many of the world 's greatest universities and taught by tenured professors , for free . tens of millions of students have already signed up for these courses over the last four years . yet enrollment in traditional colleges has n't flagged , and prices have continued to rise . the reason is clear . the free college providers ca n't -lrb- or wo n't -rrb- give online students the one thing they need more than anything else : a college degree . elite universities like harvard and stanford do n't want to dilute their exclusive brands . nonelite universities do n't want to give away something they 're currently selling for a lot of money . that 's where the federal government comes in . with some authorizing language from congress and a small , one-time start-up budget , the u.s. department of education could create a nonprofit , bipartisan organization with only two missions : approving courses and granting degrees . do n't worry , federal bureaucrats wo n't be in charge of academic matters . instead , national u. would hire teams of leading scholars to evaluate and approve courses . some of the decisions should n't be difficult . for example , this week , edx is launching a free , nine-week-long online course called `` introduction to computational thinking and data science . '' it will be taught by dr. eric grimson , who is the chancellor of the renowned massachusetts institute of technology , and dr. john guttag , who leads the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory 's data driven medical research group . the course materials mirror those taught to some of the smartest students in the world on mit 's campus in cambridge , massachusetts . it seems likely that this is a good course . national u. , moreover , would n't be limited to courses from existing colleges . any higher education provider , public or private sector , could submit a course for approval . those that are n't already accredited would pay a fee to cover the cost of evaluation . national u. would also map out which courses students need to take to earn an associate or bachelor 's degree . this wo n't be difficult , since existing colleges have already established a standard set of requirements : a certain number of approved lower - and upper-division courses , plus an approved sequence in an academic major , adding up to 60 or 120 credits . once students complete the credits , national u. will grant them a degree . while many of the courses will be free , students will bear small costs for taking exams through secure online channels or in-person testing facilities . -lrb- textbooks will be free and open-source -rrb- . students will also pay a modest fee of a few hundred dollars for the degree itself , enough to defray the operating costs of national u. lower-income students will be able to pay for those expenses using the same federal grant and loan programs they currently use to pay tuition at accredited colleges . since national u. will likely be much cheaper , this will actually save the taxpayers money in the long run . if it all sounds too good to be true , keep in mind that free online courses from the likes of mit are a very recent phenomenon . higher education policies just have n't adapted to them -- yet . the federal government 's higher education approval powers are long-established . now it just needs to use them on behalf of students , instead of traditional colleges and universities that are charging far too much . george washington was right all along .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in washington 's polarized political environment , support for israel has been a rare area of bipartisan cooperation -- at least until now . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's speech to congress on tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67-year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since president harry truman became the first head of state to recognize israel . netanyahu is driven not only by his concerns about iran 's nuclear threat -- the topic of his address -- but also by domestic political considerations . israel will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to washington . netanyahu is fighting for his political life as he faces a tougher than expected re-election campaign . he has been widely blamed at home for having failed to lower the high cost of living , an issue that his rivals have eagerly exploited . netanyahu has tried to offset some of this criticism by focusing on his perennial issue : iran . a major televised address in washington concerning iran 's threat , interrupted only by standing ovations from american lawmakers , has the potential to be far more effective than any campaign ad in projecting gravitas , reinforcing his security credentials and reminding voters of his vast experience -- in contrast to his rivals ' inexperience -- in foreign affairs . yet netanyahu 's speech , while possibly giving him a short-term boost at home , will harm jerusalem 's relations with washington , not iran 's nuclear program . speaker john boehner 's late-january invitation to netanyahu to address a joint session of congress was coordinated with neither the white house nor the state department . it was , in essence , a political ploy aimed at undermining president obama as he strives to reach a historic deal over iran 's nuclear program . in defiance of the obama administration , and rejecting advice from leading figures in israel and key supporters of israel in the united states , netanyahu accepted the invitation . by antagonizing the white house , boehner and netanyahu have put democratic members of congress in a bind , forcing them to choose between two unenviable options : either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally , but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to obama by snubbing the leader of a major u.s. ally . two senior senate democrats with sterling pro-israel credentials , richard durbin and dianne feinstein , tried to diffuse this latest crisis between washington and jerusalem by offering to meet with the israeli premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by netanyahu . feinstein had previously noted that an invitation to address congress during the israeli election period was `` highly inappropriate . '' in politicizing his visit to washington , netanyahu has allowed his bad blood with obama to spill over into his government 's increasingly complicated relationship with the democratic party . netanyahu no doubt believes that obama is misguided about the pending deal with iran . indeed , there are good reasons to be skeptical of any agreement with a regime that has long engaged in deception and concealment with respect to its nuclear program . less than two weeks ago , the international atomic energy agency reported that iran was continuing to evade questions about evidence of past work on designing nuclear weapons . yet netanyahu 's move is counterproductive . democrats on capitol hill who were inclined to support additional sanctions on iran now feel compelled to back the president . in a rare move , five former israeli ambassadors have publicly called on netanyahu to cancel his speech . former mossad chief meir dagan has accused netanyahu of having caused israel `` heavy strategic damage on the iranian issue '' by antagonizing the administration . netanyahu 's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon . he has never hid his preference for the republican party . during his first term in office , netanyahu irked president bill clinton by meeting with the rev. jerry falwell , then-house speaker newt gingrich and other detractors of the president a day before coming to the white house . a key netanyahu supporter is u.s. casino magnate sheldon adelson , a major republican donor who also owns the pro-netanyahu newspaper israel hayom . during the 2012 presidential campaign , adelson poured millions into republican challenger mitt romney 's coffers , saying he was willing to spend $ 100 million to defeat obama . that july , netanyahu 's senior adviser , ron dermer , helped orchestrate romney 's visit to israel in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of obama 's rival . dermer , a former u.s. citizen who once worked for republican pollster and political consultant frank luntz , is israel 's current ambassador to the united states . it is dermer who coordinated the invitation to netanyahu with boehner but never mentioned the invitation to secretary of state john kerry when they met a day before boehner 's announcement . this time , netanyahu may have gone too far . national security adviser susan rice did not mince words when she called netanyahu 's latest move `` destructive to the fabric of the relationship '' between the united states and israel . although the u.s.-israel relationship is strong and resilient , rooted in common values and shared interests , netanyahu is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- its famous yellow wall -- the largest free-standing grandstand in europe , with a capacity of 25,000 -- has helped enable german football club borussia dortmund achieve the rare feat of transcending the relationship between a club and its fans . so special is this club that 3,000 of its own supporters dipped into their pockets as part of a crowdfunding exercise , started in 2013 , to help finance a new documentary based on one of dortmund 's founding fathers . these dortmund fans , along with sponsors , raised $ 250,000 -lrb- $ 265,000 -rrb- in the process -- the biggest sum at the time ever raised for a film through crowdfunding in germany . `` this fan-club relationship is a legacy from our fathers , who made it clear that we have to engage and we have to fight for our club . it 's part of our story , '' marc mauricius quambusch , one of the film 's three creators , told cnn . one of those fathers , and seen as the most important , was franz jacobi , who in 1909 along with 17 others helped found the club -- and it is `` am borsigplatz geboren : franz jacobi und die wiege des bvb '' -lrb- `` born at the borsigsquare : franz jacobi and the cradle of bvb '' -rrb- that tells his story . founding fathers . mention dortmund and images are conjured up of back-to-back german bundesliga title wins in 2011 and 2012 , the champions league triumph of 1997 or how it became the first german side to win a european competition with the cup winners ' cup in 1966 . without 21-year-old jacobi and his disciples , however , none of that success may have ever materialized . for it was those brave 18 that gathered inside a pub called wildschutz just off dortmund 's borsigplatz , with the aim of establishing their own football club in response to the catholic holy trinity chaplain hubert dewald 's refusal to allow his youth group members the chance to kick a ball around . jacobi and co. managed to resist dewald 's overtures and so `` ball spiel verein borussia '' -lrb- `` ball games club borussia '' -rrb- was born . `` when we started making the film i was aware of our story but not so deeply , '' dortmund fan quambusch says of a film inspired by a similar crowdfunding project dreamed up by fortuna dusseldorf supporters in 2012 . `` it 's so interesting -- one so deep and with so much drama . '' `` it 's also a love story , it has everything you need , '' quambusch adds , referring to jacobi having originally dragged his friends to the city as he was in love with the pub owner 's daughter , who he would later go on to marry . `` if you were to try to write something , it would be exactly the same story as this . '' a legacy . jacobi 's dna today still runs through the club that he helped to establish . dortmund president from 1910 to 1923 , jacobi laid the foundations of a club which prides itself on harboring a real sense of involvement and belonging for its supporters . permitted to stay at home in germany during world war i as he was the oldest son of the family and his father had died , jacobi wrote postcards to those club members who were away fighting , while also helping to take care of their wives and children . heinrich unger , dortmund 's maiden president and jacobi 's best friend , was one of those fighting , and he would go on to write what turned out to be the club 's first ever song during his time in the trenches -- part of that song is still included in one of dortmund 's official anthems , `` wir halten fest und treu zusammen '' -lrb- `` we are standing together '' -rrb- . `` this was the beginning of the so-called ` borussia family , ' where it was more than a club , '' quambusch says , recalling a term used by jacobi . `` we have always been democratic and i think he always wanted the club members to have rights and votes , and to engage . i think jacobi would be proud of the club today . '' the borussia family . jacobi 's `` borussia family '' is not a term used officially by the club and its supporters now , but its meaning continues to resonate . with dortmund dangerously close to bankruptcy just a decade ago , fans came together to do all they could for their club , while as well as donating to fund the new film , supporters also contributed old photographs to help shed light on jacobi 's story . `` i thought it was a great idea to make the film by our own people so i donated , '' dortmund fan jorn pansch , who also donated for his mother and brother , tells cnn . `` we 've had so many more new members in recent years and it 's great to bring them our history because what is the future without the past ? `` the film remembers many , many people , where we came from , which way we 've grown up -- it made me proud to be a part of it and it shows fans and supporters stand behind the club . '' this relationship is no one-way street , though , with dortmund in response offering up $ 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- towards the project , while providing it with valuable exposure via its social-network sites . all the money raised from the film will go into social projects in dortmund -- historically an industrial and working-class area -- where the club was founded . `` today 's fan engagement has partly come about from all those years ago with jacobi , but also because borussia is located in a city that is very emotional when it comes to football , '' quambusch says . `` borussia has always had fans that have traveled for the club and tried to struggle with the club officials and are engaged . it 's a typical dortmund thing . '' espn fc german correspondent and dortmund fan stephan uersfeld adds : `` the core of the fans are very close still and the club as well is close to the fans . `` everyone still has the feeling they can do stuff and actually change things at the club . '' ` struggle to survive ' boasting the highest average attendance in the world , as well as the yellow wall , there are not many more awe-inspiring sights in football than the westfalenstadion when dortmund fans are in full voice . in an age when one bad performance from the likes of barcelona or real madrid can bring with it a chorus of boos from its supporters , dortmund fans have stood by their team for the most part this season , despite relegation from the bundesliga having threatened a club that was german champion in 2012 . `` we always need to struggle to survive in different periods , and i think maybe that 's a legacy from jacobi 's time , '' quambusch says of a club that was relegated in 1972 and narrowly escaped the same fate in 1986 . `` the ups and downs make the club more exciting , and there have been so many extreme emotions in every direction . `` i think it makes the good things much more enjoyable and wonderful because if you always win and are always top of the table it becomes boring . `` when you are a dortmund supporter you never know what you are going to get . '' pride . that sentiment most likely applied to jacobi himself , whose body today lies buried in dortmund following the club 's decision to move it into the area after originally being located 300 kilometers away in salzgitter . fifty-seven years after helping to form `` ball spiel verein borussia , '' jacobi found himself in glasgow , having put aside his fear of flying aged 78 to watch his team beat liverpool in the 1966 european cup winners ' cup final . `` that was a very special moment for him -- he said it was a big moment for him and he was really proud , '' quambusch says of jacobi , who died 13 years later at the age of 90 . `` if you 're planning a club 57 years ago , and 57 years later you are top of europe and you are the first european cup winner in germany , that must be a fantastic moment . '' born at the borsigsquare : franz jacobi and the cradle of bvb is released in german cinemas and on dvd on march 15 .
dhaka , bangladesh -lrb- cnn -rrb- bangladesh authorities say they have arrested the prime suspect in the murder of american blogger avijit roy who was hacked to death on a dhaka street last week . the person , farabi shafiur rahman , had called for avijit roy 's death in numerous facebook posts , according to roy 's parents . and within minutes after the thursday attack , rahman posted photos of the crime scene , said col. ziaul ahsan of bangladesh 's elite anti-crime unit , the rapid action battalion . in a facebook comment last year , rahman allegedly wrote , `` avijit roy lives in america . so it 's not possible to kill him now . but when he returns home , he will be killed then . '' in an earlier post , the same person wrote , `` it 's a bengali muslims holy duty to kill avijit . '' extremists resented roy for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog . they threatened to kill him if he came home from the united states to visit . as usual , roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban atlanta for dhaka , where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled `` the virus of faith . '' he has written seven books in all . roy was killed thursday as he walked back from a book fair with his wife . assailants plunged machetes and knives into roy and his wife , killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger . witnesses said no one came to the couple 's aid as they were hacked down . rahman , the man in custody , also allegedly posted threats against the owner of the online bookstore , rokomari.com , forcing it to stop selling roy 's books . and last year , he was detained -- then released -- for comments he allegedly made in support of the death of another blogger , ahmed rajib haider . like roy , haider too was hacked to death . he too had written critically about religion on his blog . cnn 's ray sanchez , lonzo cook , greg botelho , farid ahmed and john couwels contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- texas is nearly out of its lethal injection drug . if scheduled executions this wednesday and the next go forward , the state will have completely exhausted its supply of pentobarbital . `` we 're exploring all options , '' said jason clark , spokesman for the texas department of criminal justice , '' including the continued use of pentobarbital or an alternate drug -lrb- s -rrb- in the lethal injection process . '' in recent years , states across the country have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions . the european manufacturers of pentobarbital , an anesthetic , explicitly banned u.s. prisons from using its drug in executions . tennessee has said it will electrocute inmates if it ca n't get the drugs it needs . other states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail . in april , oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry . clayton lockett , a convicted rapist and murderer , writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered . it took 43 minutes for him to die . texas gets its pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies , which are not subject to food and drug administration oversight , something opponents of the death penalty have decried . the state leads the nation in the numbers of executions . last year , it put to death 10 people . this year , it has executed three so far .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's outrage time again . this time it 's over a `` saturday night live '' commercial parody that aired over the weekend . the subject -lrb- take a deep breath and prepare to be shocked -rrb- : isis . yes , that barbaric terrorist group was ridiculed in a parody of a toyota camry commercial . the original toyota ad depicted a father driving his daughter to the airport . he then tearfully says goodbye as his daughter heads off to join the u.s. army . in the `` snl '' parody , the daughter is played by dakota johnson , star of the hugely successful s&m film `` 50 shades of grey . '' -lrb- good to see america has gotten over being offended by the mainstreaming of s&m . -rrb- as the parody commercial ends , however , it 's revealed that the daughter is not joining the army , but isis . we then see a pickup filled with isis fighters drive up as a worried dad comments to his daughter : `` you be careful , ok ? '' johnson replies reassuringly : `` dad ! it 's just isis . '' the father then turns to an isis fighter and says , with emotion , `` take care of her . '' in reply , the militant whispers : `` death to america . '' and ... cue the outrage !! twitter lit up instantly . twitter user @ematrudo called nbc and `` snl '' `` tasteless scum ! '' and steve bucci of conservative think tank the heritage foundation even went as far as to tweet : `` snl isis skit also draws a moral equivalence between isis murderers and the u.s. military -lrb- based on the spoofed commercial -rrb- , that is wrong . '' some , apparently in the minority if the media coverage is any indication , also praised `` snl '' : . but my favorite tweet was this one : . @kmorrison is 100 % correct . the sketch mocked isis and on some level those who would fall for its sales pitch , like , perhaps , the three young british girls who reportedly headed to join them . comically skewering isis is exactly the right thing to do -- it should be done even more . in fact , in lebanon , the united arab emirates and even in iraq , where isis is slaughtering people , brave muslim comedians are ridiculing isis on tv , in youtube videos and in cartoons . and i can assure you that if isis were to catch these comedians , it would n't just tweet about its outrage , it would kill them . so why do these comedians take the chance ? because , they say , it undermines isis , and also , for many , it is cathartic to laugh at the terrorists , as opposed to shivering in fear about them . this is the same reason mel brooks featured `` springtime for hitler '' in his hit musical comedy , `` the producers '' : it was a way of using comedy as revenge . brooks saw it as a way to rob hitler of his power -lrb- even if posthumously -rrb- by causing audiences to laugh at him . what 's more , the `` snl '' parody makes an important but subtle point . on the side of the isis pickup , the arabic writing does not state a religious expression . rather it says , `` i love cats . '' as someone who worked at `` snl '' for eight years , i can assure you this was not happenstance , but rather was by design . to me , the `` i love cats '' line shows that `` snl '' grasps what many on the right refuse to . as i heard firsthand when i attended the white house summit on countering violent extremism two weeks ago , isis will despicably use any means to recruit people . consequently , as ludicrous as it may seem , saying `` we love cats '' to young girls is not beyond isis . when i look at the outrage over this `` snl '' political parody , i have to wonder : were n't we all `` je suis charlie hebdo '' just a few weeks ago ? remember when we stood firmly with political satirists . well , apparently that sentiment ended for some as soon as they saw political satire they did n't like . i understand that some will be offended by political comedy with which they do n't agree . but in a time when freedom of expression is under attack , if you are offended by political satire on tv , then change the channel .
havana , cuba -lrb- cnn -rrb- photos published in cuba 's state-run press on monday show fidel castro meeting with five cuban intelligence agents who served lengthy prison sentences in the united states . castro reportedly met the agents saturday at his home in havana , ending speculation over why the former cuban president had not yet seen the men , who are referred to as `` the five heroes '' by cuba 's government . the last of the agents returned to cuba in december following a prisoner swap that also freed u.s. state department contractor alan gross , who was jailed in cuba . the swap coincided with an announcement of a change in u.s. policy toward cuba . castro 's wife , dalia soto del valle , is also shown , as is his nephew alejandro castro espín , the son of cuban president raul castro and a colonel in cuba 's interior ministry . these `` anti-terrorist heroes never did any harm to the united states , '' fidel castro wrote in an article published in the daily communist party newspaper granma on monday , which said he met with them for five hours . `` they tried to prevent and impede terrorist acts against our people . '' u.s. officials have said the men were part of a spy ring that monitored the anti-castro cuban exile community and military installations in florida . castro on monday though said the men were not spying on u.s. military capabilities , stating that a now-shuttered russian spy station allowed the cubans to be aware of any impending u.s. attack on the island . `` that center allowed us to be aware of any object that moved thousands of miles from our country , '' castro wrote , referring the lourdes spy base in cuba , which russia closed in 2001 . the men were arrested in 1998 and charged with carrying out a slew of intelligence gathering activities . seven other agents agreed to cooperate with u.s. prosecutors , but five of the agents refused to switch sides . the men were lauded as heroes by the cuban government , which held large demonstrations demanding their release in front of the u.s. interests section in havana . agents rene gonzalez , 58 , and fernandez gonzalez , 51 , returned to cuba in 2014 after serving their prison sentences . the remaining three agents -- gerardo hernandez , 49 ; antonio guerrero , 56 ; and ramon labañino , 51 -- were transferred to cuba a part of a prisoner swap after serving 16 years in u.s. prisons . last month , all five were presented with the hero of the republic award , the highest honor presented by the cuban government . many cubans though wondered why the men had not yet met with fidel castro , who had championed their cause during his final years as president . in the article published on monday , castro said he had not seen the men previously to allow them time with their families and to undergo extensive medical checkups .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for the uninitiated , skydiving can be scary enough : leaping out of a plane , free-falling at 120 miles per hour , keeping your presence of mind as you pull the cord on your parachute . now imagine having a seizure and losing consciousness more than 9,000 feet above the earth . that 's what happened to christopher jones , 22 , of perth , australia . his experience was captured on a video that has more than 4.4 million views on youtube . `` halfway through the skydive , he had a seizure and rolled onto his back , '' wa skydiving academy business manager and chief instructor robin o'neill told the australian broadcasting corporation . instructor sheldon mcfarlane , who was wearing a helmet camera , struggled to catch up with jones . mcfarlane finally managed to grab jones at about 4,000 feet and pull the rip cord . jones regained consciousness and landed uneventfully , o'neill said . mcfarlane told the abc he was n't concerned . thanks to two `` aads '' -- automatic activation devices -- jones ' parachute was going to automatically deploy , he said . nevertheless , the instructor wanted to make sure the situation was completely under control . `` at no time was i worried he was going to hit the ground without a parachute , but given the circumstances and where we were i thought it would be better to get him under parachute earlier than later , '' mcfarlane said . `` i managed to catch him on my second attempt and deploy his parachute . '' jones , who described the incident on youtube as `` possibly the scariest moment of my life , '' told the abc that skydiving was a substitute for his dream of becoming a pilot . he had been cleared by his doctor to jump . `` i 've always wanted to have the feeling of flight , so i just thought , considering i ca n't fly a plane due to my condition , i thought i 'd give it a go , '' he said . jones told the abc that he 'd been seizure-free for four years but was not intending to pursue a skydiving career .
kabul , afghanistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- for almost a week , avalanches caused by heavy snowstorms have killed 196 people in the mountainous province of panjshir , afghanistan , officials said on monday . ten new avalanches were reported early monday morning , without any casualties . over the weekend , a total of 40 avalanches hit the area , said bab jan hakimi , head of disaster response at the afghan red crescent society . rescue operations and emergency assistance by air and ground are still ongoing , hakimi said . however , authorities fear the toll will grow much higher since rescue personnel have yet to reach the worst affected areas . president ashraf ghani , who visited the area on saturday , declared three days of mourning in afghanistan for the victims . panjshir is a small , mountainous province north of the capital , kabul . its residents are generally poor , earning their living as farmers , shepherds or operators of small businesses such as groceries . cnn 's masoud popalzai reported from kabul , afghanistan and journalist naomi ng wrote from hong kong .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- adi shankar had the idea for `` power/rangers '' when he was 7 years old . `` this was before the internet , and my access to tv and video games was pretty limited , '' the producer recalled thursday , in the midst of the `` power/rangers '' frenzy . `` so all you really had was -lrb- to -rrb- tell people stories . so i 'd tell people ` captain planet ' stories , and then i started telling them these dark ` power ranger ' stories . `` and i got into trouble , '' he added . `` because the parents were like , ` this guy , he 's ruining our children ! ' '' that was more than 20 years ago for shankar . but the producer , now 30 , got his wish when his dark version of the `` mighty morphin power rangers , '' directed by friend joseph kahn , made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on youtube in less than two days . fans buzzing over bloody ` power/rangers ' ` bootleg ' in some ways , shankar is still getting into trouble . not only did the video explode the power rangers mythology , showing the impact of serving as `` child soldiers , '' in shankar 's phrase , but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise , saban entertainment , claimed infringement . first it was taken down from vimeo and then youtube . however , it was reposted in both places late friday after lawyers reached agreement , deadline reported . among the additions : a disclaimer from shankar that his `` bootleg '' is `` my take on the fan film . not a pilot , not a series , not for profit , strictly for exhibition . this is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by saban entertainment or lionsgate nor is it selling any product . i claim no rights to any of the characters -lrb- do n't send me any money , not kickstarted , this film is free -rrb- . '' saban entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular '90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016 . ` an interesting experiment ' so who are these guys , anyway ? kahn is a famed music video director , probably best known for britney spears ' `` toxic , '' eminem 's `` without me '' -lrb- for which he won a grammy -rrb- and taylor swift 's `` blank space . '' he 's also handled a number of commercials and the films `` detention '' and `` torque . '' shankar is a producer of such films as `` the grey , '' `` killing them softly '' and `` dredd . '' this is n't the first time he 's made a `` bootleg '' short . previous videos have included one featuring marvel 's punisher character and one drawing from marvel 's venom character . in a reddit ama , kahn said that `` power/rangers '' was `` self-funded . '' a special effects house , ingenuity engine , `` worked six months on this and took a bath financially , '' he added . shankar declined to give a budget for `` power/rangers , '' which was shot over a few days last year , but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals ' money . `` it was all favors , '' he says , noting that star james van der beek `` is one of my best friends . '' the film also starred `` battlestar galactica 's '' katee sackhoff . both shankar and kahn like to subvert concepts and cliches . kahn said he was drawn to `` power/rangers '' because `` it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control . ... i did n't come into it to please a fan base , per se , but to experiment with pop culture . '' and shankar ? even his look tries to upset stereotypes . in the video he made to explain `` power/rangers , '' he 's wearing eye makeup like the 1970s alice cooper , a look he adopted `` because i do n't want to be -lrb- an indian -rrb- stereotype , '' he told cnn . ` kind of a war brewing ' shankar comes by his outlook honestly . the indian-born producer had an itinerant childhood thanks to his father 's job , traveling frequently -- various indian cities , china , singapore -- before moving on to the next place . he came to the united states at 16 . he says he thinks of his childhood as `` jarring , '' with the only constants comic books , movies and television . `` just moving around so much , literally every two years , '' he said . `` i did n't feel like i had a friend until i was 18 . if you 're moving to a different school , let alone a different country every couple years , it 's kind of jarring as a kid . there was no consistency for me in a cultural context '' except for american movies and pop culture . he attended school at northwestern university in chicago , where he founded a successful ad agency , and then moved to hollywood , which he describes as `` a dream of mine . '' though both men were successful before , `` power/rangers '' has given them new visibility -- partly thanks to the bottom-up enthusiasm for the project . both filmmakers wax philosophical about the impact . `` internet changes things , '' kahn tweeted after congratulating supporters . `` new world , new rules . '' shankar observes that `` power/rangers '' is just another marker in a continuing debate between creativity , intellectual property and fan-driven culture . `` there 's kind of a war brewing between the old world and the new world , '' he said . `` the internet has kind of been a nuclear warhead on a lot of businesses and a lot of industries . ... it 's kind of bizarre to be thrown in the middle of it . i 'm literally just a fan making a fan video . '' it 's not about dollars and cents , he added : `` is that what we 're about ? we 're one massive consumerist mosh pit ? '' in the meantime , he 's got plenty of other projects cooking , including a crime thriller set in a world of both puppets and humans that 's like `` a really dark , violent ` muppet movie . ' '' it all comes down to the same impulse that drove him to tell stories when he was 7 , he says . `` i 'm just a creative dude , '' he said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the chinese government has declared the internet to be the new battlefield in its fight against `` pornography and unlawful information . '' the chilling reality is that the main casualty of this cyberwar is freedom of expression . china 's internet model is one of extreme control . the authorities use an army of censors to stifle dissent . in january , the orwellian `` state internet information office '' announced it had shut down scores of websites and more than 100 social media accounts for `` distorting history of the communist party and the nation . '' under the guise of a campaign to ensure social stability , the chinese authorities suppress online debate on a range of legitimate issues . dozens of phrases are censored on social media including any mention of the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown or the recent hong kong pro-democracy protests . thousands of websites , including wikipedia , facebook , instagram and twitter remain blocked . while the new battlefield is virtual , the impact on people 's lives is real and devastating . since president xi jinping came to power , hundreds of people have been detained solely for expressing their peaceful views online . it is women 's rights activists , anti-corruption and environmental campaigners , and those urging debate on political and legal reforms who fall foul of online censors . su changlan was detained by police in october 2014 . her apparent `` crime '' was to have posted comments online in support of hong kong 's pro-democracy protests . she faces charges of `` inciting subversion of state power , '' and a potential sentence of life imprisonment . liu ping , a 45-year-old mother and grassroots activist , languishes in jail right now . last june , she was sentenced to six years in prison on the charge of `` picking quarrels and provoking troubles '' for publicly calling on the chinese government to step up the fight against corruption . liu ping 's online posts of photos of her holding banners calling for transparency , and transcripts of skype chats with foreign media , were used to condemn her at her trial . the paradox is that president xi has made great mileage out of his own anti-corruption drive . the persecution of liu ping , and many others that raise these issues only underlines the hypocrisy of the current leadership . this online attack is part of the worst crackdown against freedom of expression in china in more than a decade . under president xi , it is an assault on all fronts : in academia , in the media , civil society and online . ilham tohti , an economics professor at central university for nationalities in beijing and the founder of the `` uyghur online '' website was sentenced to life imprisonment in september 2014 on charges of `` separatism . '' the charge was based on his online articles , university lectures and interviews with foreign media . he worked to peacefully build bridges between ethnic communities and often criticized government policies that promoted discrimination . i have not seen evidence that his words did otherwise . the chinese authorities abuse the law to suppress online freedom and target critical voices , yet have the guile to portray such persecution as evidence of the rule of law in action . far from relenting , the government is introducing a swath of regressive legislation and regulations in a further assault against online privacy and freedom of expression . a new , vaguely worded draft anti-terror law lacks sufficient safeguards and gives the authorities virtually a free rein to collect information on individuals ' online activities . all internet and telecommunication service providers operating in china would be required to give the government backdoor access to their systems and details about the encryption used . yes , the government has a responsibility to ensure national security and to combat serious crime , but such measures must be targeted and proportionate to the threat . internet companies doing business in china must also take all possible efforts to avoid contributing to human rights abuses . at the international level the chinese government looks to legitimize its actions . china 's charismatic `` internet czar , '' lu wei , extolls the concept of `` internet sovereignty '' and promotes it as an acceptable global model . this initiative must not go unchallenged . internet sovereignty in china equals censorship and persecution ; a web to trap thousands of individuals peacefully expressing different views online . while the immediate outlook is bleak , there is hope . the internet has proved invaluable to the development of human rights -- revolutionizing access to information and improving transparency and accountability . for every online critic the chinese authorities imprison , there are scores more prepared to speak out despite the risks . it is with these courageous individuals that those of us who value online freedom must stand united . the battle to promote internet sovereignty and silence all critical voices is one the chinese authorities must not be allowed to win . the opinions expressed here are solely those of the author .
beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- if you live in china and have n't watched -- or at least heard about -- `` under the dome , '' you must have been living under a rock . the almost two-hour documentary on air pollution in china produced by a famous tv journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release saturday , clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across chinese cyberspace . the air pollution that 's choking asia . here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context : . the slickly produced video shows journalist chai jing presenting a comprehensive slide show , intercutting with fast-paced footage of her travels across china and the rest of world , to find answers to three questions : what is smog , where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it ? as shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of china regularly , the video has struck such a chord with the audience that , in two short days , it 's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world 's most populous nation . many internet users have compared it to `` an inconvenient truth , '' the oscar-winning documentary on former u.s. vice president al gore 's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming . chai , 39 , was already a household name before last weekend thanks to her career at china central television , the state-run national broadcaster . as a long-time cctv anchor and investigative reporter , chai stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines . her choice of stories and style of reporting -- calm but tenacious -- have earned her legions of fans nationwide -- with some nicknaming her `` the goddess '' for her elegance and intelligence on air . plenty of detractors , however , consider her a leading elitist voice for the country 's liberal intellectuals . after writing a best-selling autobiography chronicling her time at cctv , chai quit her job last year to take care of her daughter , who had been born with a tumor . declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother , chai tries to dig deep in her self-funded documentary . with her former cctv connections opening doors , she followed and interviewed top environmental and energy officials and experts in china -- and received surprisingly candid responses . while there is no obvious hero in the video , the villain seems to be clear . a former chief engineer of the state-owned oil conglomerate sinopec brushes off chai 's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible . tracing the main source of tiny and dangerous pollutants in china to extremely inefficient energy exploration and use , chai sees the solution in dismantling entrenched interests of the state energy sector -- and also appeals to the public for less reliance on cars and more proactive reporting of polluters . admiration from celebrity and ordinary viewers -- many said to be moved to tears -- poured in almost immediately . in countless reposts of the video links , people praise chai for her courage to address the sensitive topic head on and spread the knowledge to the masses . one text message of gratitude to chai from the new minister of environmental protection -- who had been appointed only a day earlier -- has fueled suspicion among her critics that the video was nothing more than a government pr move . they point to the positive coverage of the video 's massive online launch across state media , including an in-depth interview with chai on the website of people 's daily , the ruling communist party 's official newspaper . also , the timing : the video was released just days ahead of china 's annual parliament session , during which legislators are expected to rubber-stamp the communist leadership 's policy agenda . president xi jinping had declared keeping the sky blue in the country as a top priority . some argue that the energy industry makes a convenient political target , as xi 's ongoing anti-corruption campaign had netted a former senior leader whose power bases included the state oil sector . others even see the video as propaganda to prepare people for mass layoffs in overbuilt and inefficient state industries as the government restructures the economy . questions have also arisen on the science in the video -- including chai 's apparent linking smog to her baby daughter 's tumor . and the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even china 's seasoned censors off guard . heated arguments have raged online , including blaming pollution on china 's political system due to its lack of accountability . by late sunday night , although the video remained online , all mention of it had been scrubbed from homepages of web portals and news sites . with discussions on the video shifting to social media , a common consensus seems to have emerged : love it or hate it , chai 's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the u.s. embassy as recently as november . some internet users have compared `` under the dome '' phenomena to the discussion over `` the dress '' -- you can fight over the color but what 's important is that it 's being talked about .
charleston , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- thirty years or so ago , the synagogue in washington dc where i was attending yom kippur services received a bomb threat . as we evacuated the building , i was concerned that people did n't seem to be taking it seriously . i was visiting from europe , where terrorism was a fact of life , and i was scared . throughout the 1970s and 1980s in europe , and even beyond , far-left and far-right extremists , the ira , radical palestinians , and a variety of other groups carried out thousands of terror attacks , big and small , that left thousands dead or injured . jewish , israeli -- and american -- sites were targets of some of the most notorious attacks : from the massacre of israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics , to plane and cruise ship hijackings , to attacks on airports , synagogues , and simply places where jews congregated , such as the jo goldenberg kosher deli in paris , where six died and 22 were wounded in a bloody attack in august 1982 . in rome , where i lived for parts of the 1970s and '80s , we tended to avoid certain streets where el al and u.s. airlines had their offices . the first big story i helped cover as a young reporter was a bloody attack at the city 's fiumicino airport in december 1973 . a dozen years later , the daughter of friends was killed in another palestinian attack there . the main synagogue in rome has been under tight guard since palestinian attackers threw hand grenades and sprayed machinegun fire at worshippers after services in october 1982 , killing a toddler and wounding dozens . i do n't want to discount the gravity and horror of recent terror attacks against jewish targets in europe , such as in copenhagen and paris . i just want to add some perspective . many things have changed over the decades . post-cold war power vacuums and middle east upheavals have given rise to radical islamism and globalized jihadist terror networks whose message , fanned out via the internet and social media , strikes a chord in disaffected youth . to be sure , jews are being targeted . but it is important to recognize that jews are being targeted as part of a violent campaign against western democracies and western values in general . today 's victims of islamist terror include christians and muslims as well as jews . in the middle east and africa , women , children , students , and cultural heritage -- history -- are also directly targeted . in some ways , today 's jihadist terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades : the anti-jewish/anti-israel terrorism of radical palestinian groups and the anti-establishment , even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system . anti-semitism takes many forms . criticism of israel is legitimate -lrb- and sometimes necessary -rrb- , but it can , and sometimes does , cross the line . this is n't new either , however . jews in europe have been regarded -- and scapegoated -- as surrogates for israel for decades . in 1967-68 , after israel defeated arab states in the six-day war , poland 's communist regime staged an `` anti-zionist '' campaign that forced most of the remaining jews out of the country . at least 13,000 jews emigrated , according to dariusz stola , who is now the director of the museum of the history of polish jews . other experts put the figure as high as 20,000 . this was -- and remains -- by far the most widespread episode of anti-semitism in post-holocaust europe . twenty years later , in 1988 , a report by the anti-defamation league warned that a significant number of anti-semitic incidents in the united states now reflected `` a politically-related anti-israel component . '' a jta news report at the time quoted adl national director abraham foxman as noting that the phenomenon was new in the united states , but `` it 's been a common occurrence in european countries . '' particularly worrisome , the report said , were israel-related anti-semitic incidents on college campuses . sound familiar ? after the holocaust , it was common to view jews in europe as sitting with their suitcases packed , just in case . but -- unlike poland 's `` anti-zionist '' campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to jews and did not prompt a mass exodus . nor should -- or will -- it now . the nazis , followed by communist rule in half of the continent , almost succeeded in making europe judenrein . following the most recent terror attacks , jewish and european national leaders have made clear that this is not an option . moreover , despite the terrorist threat , european governments have refused to budge in their defense of democratic values . it is wise to be on guard , of course , and there is indeed ample cause for alarm -- even fear . but we should also be on guard against something else -- against a facile temptation to cry wolf that can all too easily distort alarm into alarmism -- and fear into fear-mongering .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- real madrid 's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire , but barcelona coach luis enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front . sunday 's 6-1 demolition of rayo vallecano put the catalan side one point above real at the top of spain 's la liga , with lionel messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward luis suarez also scored twice . even without suspended brazil star neymar -- the third prong of barca 's striking line -- enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in madrid wounds following saturday 's 1-0 defeat at athletic bilbao . `` we 're elated , but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season . i already said that everybody could lose a game , so we have to keep playing well and win every match , '' he said . `` it 's heavy having to win every single match . each game is more important than the last . '' by contrast , real coach carlo ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against villarreal . `` there is no link-up play , our play is too based around individual play , we need another way of attacking , with faster play and fewer touches , '' said the italian , who must rouse his troops for tuesday 's european champions league last-16 , second-leg tie at home to schalke . `` it is quite confusing to see what we 're doing at the moment in attack . the ball does n't move around quickly . '' while real 's front trio of top scorer cristiano ronaldo , karim benzema and gareth bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season , barca 's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams ' `` el clasico '' clash at the nou camp in a fortnight . messi 's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a spanish club player , and took him past ronaldo as the la liga leader on 24 trebles . the argentina star also drew level with the portugal captain as the spanish league 's top scorer this season on 30 goals . it 's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals , with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign . suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games , and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from english club liverpool after a world cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on italy 's giorgio chiellini . `` suarez and messi are having more and more chemistry , and today we all saw what they bring to the team , '' enrique said . `` i like -lrb- ivan -rrb- rakitic wherever he plays on the field . he always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we 've ever had . '' '' -lrb- gerard -rrb- piqué has always known how to score , above all on set plays . it 's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively . '' both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000 , barca 's best this season : rayo defender tito for a foul on suarez in the 55th minute that allowed messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty ; and dani alves for tripping alberto bueno , who also netted the resulting spot-kick . barca 's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed atletico madrid after the defending champion 's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed valencia later sunday . koke put atletico ahead in the first half but shkodran mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left , while valencia teammate javi fuego received two late yellow cards . sixth-placed villarreal beat celta vigo 4-0 , while real sociedad beat espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash . in italy , second-placed roma missed a chance to put pressure on leader juventus after being held 0-0 at struggling chievo verona on sunday . it left rudi garcia 's team eight points adrift of juve , which hosts sassuolo on monday . third-placed napoli also drew , blowing a two-goal lead against inter milan as rodrigo palacio and mauro icardi , with an 87th-minute penalty , canceled out second-half goals by marek hamsik and gonzalo higuain . in germany , bayer leverkusen moved up to fourth with a 3-0 win at paderborn as south korea striker heung-min son scored two late goals after a 73rd-minute opener from greece defender kyriakos papadopoulos . in france , lyon restored a one-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win at montpellier , as young midfielder nabil fekir scored twice . in england , premier league side liverpool faces an fa cup replay after being held 0-0 by second-tier blackburn .
seoul , south korea -lrb- cnn -rrb- north korea has fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea of japan , a south korean defense ministry official said . the missiles were fired from north korea 's west coast into the sea , which is also known as the east sea , around 6:30 a.m. and 6:40 a.m. monday -lrb- 4:30 p.m. and 4:40 p.m. et sunday -rrb- , the official said . they were fired from an area near nampo city , located about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- southwest of pyongyang . the two projectiles were estimated to have flown about 490 kilometers -lrb- 304 miles -rrb- before falling into the sea east of the peninsula , according to the south korean official , who asked to remain anonymous citing government policy . considering the speed , altitude and distance the missiles traveled , they are assumed to be scud-cs , according to the south korean defense ministry . the missiles were fired as the united states and south korea began annual military drills , which united states forces korea describes as `` nonprovocative training '' that are `` an important component of readiness '' for defending south korea . the annual joint military exercises , called foal eagle and key reserve , have long sparked tension between north korea , south korea and the united states . north korea 's state-run kcna slammed the joint military exercises monday , saying that the drills are `` nothing but a smokescreen '' by the united states and south korea `` to cover up their surprise invasion of the north . '' `` the situation on the korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war , '' kcna said , noting that north korea 's military `` will never remain a passive onlooker in this grave situation .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- slain russian opposition figure boris nemtsov knew criticizing the kremlin was dangerous , but thought his fame would protect him . the 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with his girlfriend anna duritskaya when he was gunned down in moscow on friday . nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government . the most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against putin . in an interview with cnn 's anthony bourdain last year , nemtsov spoke of the deaths of other kremlin critics , but said his fame offered some protection . `` i 'm a well-known guy , and this is a safety because if something happens with me , it will be scandal not only in moscow city but throughout the world , '' he said then . after nemtsov was shot , putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said in a statement . but critics of putin have in the past suffered miserable fates . last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russian journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya . business magnate mikhail khodorkovsky accused putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps . russian spy alexander litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put putin in power . he was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in london in 2006 . no killer has been caught . in their 2014 interview , nemtsov told bourdain he believed russia 's existing power structure was like 19th century russia , with one person in control and no real freedom of press , real competition or elections or an independent judiciary or rule of law . `` you are in the typical country of crony capitalism , '' he said . `` if you have a good relationship with putin and his people around , you will have a good relationship with governor or mayor -- it does n't matter . if you are in the city you have a chance to raise money , to be successful ... you know , to buy real estate in the south of france or switzerland , to open accounts in swiss banks . `` but , if something happened between you and putin and you are governor , you will be in jail . '' nemstov said in most places around the world , wealth provided opportunity and independence , but said that it was different in russia . `` to be wealthy , you must be loyal . if you want to be independent , forget about business , forget about raising money , '' he said . `` if you are rich , you are a slave . if you are rich , you are very much dependent . '' many people preferred to be able make money and not speak out , he said . `` this is a country of corruption , '' nemtsov said . `` for putin 's russia , this is a system . this is not a problem . '' `` if you are corrupted , but you are loyal , and you serve the kremlin , you are first of all rich and secondly you are in a very safe position . ''
irbil , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- iraqi forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of tikrit from isis , even uniting sunni and shiite fighters in the mission . the iraqi army , along with sunni and shiite militiamen , attacked isis strongholds in the area monday , the state-run iraqiya tv reported . iraqi warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around tikrit . it 's part of a wide-scale offensive ordered by iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi on sunday . tikrit fell to isis in june of 2014 , after the group 's capture of iraq 's second-largest city , mosul . tikrit is best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . isis , the radical sunni militant group , has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of iraq and syria . iraqi forces approached tikrit from several fronts , iraqiya tv reported , engaging with isis north of the city at al-alam and south of the city at al-dour . the element of surprise probably was not a factor , as reports of iraqi troops amassing near tikrit were widely shared . what awaits the iraqi army is most likely a long , hard slog and not a quick rout . tikrit is a big city , and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from isis . there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014 . while iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area , it has generally been under isis control for the last eight months or so . the joint iraqi forces fighting to retake tikrit include iraqi troops , members of the shia al-hashed al-shaabi militia , members of the sunni sons of salahuddin brigades , and other sunni tribal fighters . the offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all . al-abadi , who is also commander in chief of the armed forces , said on twitter that he will `` oversee the operation to liberate tikrit '' from isis . in short , this is the biggest test for an army trying to claw back territory that fell to isis last summer after a string of dramatic defeats . last june , tikrit was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by isis militants . they captured more than a thousand iraqi soldiers , who laid down their arms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to flee a base once used by u.s. forces . isis subsequently executed as many as 1,700 soldiers , and posted the video of the killing online . there is concern that iraqi forces , eager for revenge , may kill combatants and civilians alike . the u.n. 's envoy to iraq , nickolay mladenov , urged all armed forces in tikrit to do their utmost to spare civilians . u.s. and other coalition troops have been conducting a crash course to retrain and upgrade the iraqi army , and several thousand iraqi troops have passed through the course . this offensive will tell whether that training has made a difference . the offensive also highlights the role played by neighboring iran in the fight against isis . the semiofficial iranian fars news agency reports that qassim sulaimani , the commander of the elite iranian al-quds brigade , is helping oversee the operation to retake tikrit . iran has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraqi government . if the offensive succeeds , it means that retaking mosul , a city 10 times bigger , is possible . but tikrit is almost 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- south of mosul , and much of the territory in between is under isis control . al-abadi has said the immediate goal is to liberate salah ad-din province , of which tikrit is the capital , and then focus on adjacent al-anbar province , a similarly sunni-dominated province . after that , retaking mosul is an option . if , however , the tikrit offensive fails , it could spell disaster for baghdad . there will be political recriminations , the already fragile morale of the iraqi army could collapse , the kurdish autonomous region could decide to break from iraq , and it would provide isis with a victory it has n't seen since last summer . ben wedeman reported from irbil , and mariano castillo reported from atlanta . cnn 's yousuf basil , holly yan , kareem khadder , hamdi alkhshali and mohammed tawfeeq contributed to this report .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- britain 's royal mint has unveiled a new portrait of queen elizabeth ii , which will gradually appear on coins in the united kingdom . it is the fifth portrait of the british monarch to be used on coins during her 63-year reign . production of the new coins began monday , and they will appear in circulation later this year , the royal mint said . the new design depicts the queen wearing the royal diamond diadem crown from her coronation . artist jody clark said he researched images online when deciding which crown to use . `` i think it 's the most familiar and i wanted to make some clear distinctions between the -lrb- most recent -rrb- portrait by ian rank-broadley frbs , as her majesty really has n't aged too much in the years since . '' `` frbs '' refers to rank-broadley 's fellowship in the royal british society of sculptors , a professional organization that advances the art of sculpture . a panel selected clark 's design from a number by specialist designers across britain invited to submit anonymous work . the design was then submitted to the british chancellor and the queen for final approval . clark is a member of the royal mint 's team of designers and engravers . he is the first mint engraver to produce a definitive royal coinage portrait in more than a century , the organization said . `` jody 's achievement is something that we can celebrate as a proud moment for the royal mint . capturing a portrait on the surface of a coin demands the utmost skill , and is one of the most challenging disciplines of the coin designer 's art , '' chief executive adam lawrence said . `` this change of royal portrait will make 2015 a vintage year for uk coins , and it will be hugely exciting for us all to see the new design appear on the coins we use every day . '' royal coinage portraits are usually updated every 15 to 20 years , the royal mint said . the last portrait was created by sculptor rank-broadley in 1998 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the center of china 's eastern zhejiang province lies commodity city , which photographer richard john seymour says is the largest small-commodity wholesale market in the world . the shopper 's paradise , in the city of yiwu , covers 46 million square feet and has about 62,000 booths , with 100,000 suppliers exhibiting 400,000 kinds of products . the sheer enormity of the place posed challenges for london-based seymour , who visited commodity city twice last year . `` i tried to see as much as i could in the days that i was there , and became very quickly exhausted by the constant sensory overload , '' he said via email . `` i spent a total of four days constantly walking around yiwu and would n't say i got near to seeing all of the stalls . '' seymour 's `` yiwu commodity city '' photo project began in january 2014 , when he established both the style and content of his photos : the sellers in their environments in addition to the monotony of the market itself . when seymour returned to yiwu in august , he felt well-prepared to begin shooting . during this visit , he also came to better understand the atmosphere and dynamics of the market . `` the atmosphere of the market was quite unusual in that one gets the sense that it really is home to a community , '' he said . `` the second trip i made to the market was during school summer vacation , and because of this there were children in a huge number of the stores who obviously -lrb- spent -rrb- the day in the market with their parents . there were also children running and playing throughout the market , riding scooters along its vast corridors , chasing each other around , etc. . it gave the impression that this was more than just a place of business , but a place of life , something that took me by surprise . '' the photos are like an endless delivery of presents , as each and every shot unwraps an assortment of contents within the identically square-shaped booths of the sellers . `` shooting yiwu in a repetitive way , for me , becomes a very interesting way of describing the place , as each store becomes describable only by the items for sale within it , '' seymour said . an estimated 40,000 visitors make their way into commodity city every day . many of them are retail buyers . because of the large number of visitors and their diverse backgrounds , buyers and sellers typically communicate utilizing translators that work in the market permanently . `` there is a broad mix of people in yiwu , buyers and sellers come from all over the world . however just from my own experiences and those of others i spoke to , the fastest growing markets are of middle eastern and african buyers , '' seymour said . there are thousands of orders placed at commodity city that are later sold to consumers in many different countries . `` i learned a great deal during this project , '' seymour said . `` if there was one thing that particularly stands out , it was the scale of production in china . ... everything in yiwu is a one-of-a-kind sample . orders are made in yiwu , but the factories nearby manufacture the items , so what you 're seeing in the market is actually not for sale . this is why the stores are so visually rich , because there is no need for multiple samples , every item is different . '' what makes seymour 's photos so striking is how they encompass a mixture of familiar sights with unknown wonder . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` possibly the most interesting aspect of this project was when i occasionally encountered an item that was very familiar to me in such a strange place , '' he said . `` we tend to adopt quite personal emotions to our belongings , and if we see something in our own home every day then it naturally fosters quite an intimate relationship . what was interesting was then seeing one of these items halfway across the globe , a constant reminder that we have a connection with places around the world -lrb- that -rrb- we know next to nothing about . '' many of the items shown in the photographs are very ordinary . there are woolen hats , artificial flowers , mannequins and even cooking utensils . but there are also mysterious sellers barely visible in their booths . just as the city of yiwu is surrounded by mountains , the sellers at commodity city are boxed-in by their very own mountains of commodities . `` for me there -lrb- is -rrb- quite a beautiful metaphor in yiwu , there is a kind of beauty in the numbness of the expressions in contrast with their colorful surroundings , perhaps highlighting the perils of untapped consumption , '' seymour said . `` the inhabitants of these spaces become almost swallowed by the objects that make them their living . they are , quite literally , consumed . '' the `` yiwu commodity city '' photos are part of a larger series by seymour titled `` consumed , '' and it was completed in collaboration with the unknown fields division , a nomadic design studio that works to show how distant landscapes connect to the rest of the world . seymour 's photos ultimately leave viewers to reflect upon the possibility that commodity city may in fact be the origin of many of the products they currently own . `` i definitely view the items i see in many shops differently now that i have seen -lrb- yiwu -rrb- . i 'll often see a particular item whilst walking around london and think to myself , ` i 'm sure that came from yiwu , ' '' seymour said . according to china 's state-run news agency xinhua , more than 60 % of the world 's christmas decorations are made in yiwu and wholesaled at commodity city . the likelihood is relevant well beyond christmastime , however . whether enjoying the beach , purchasing clothing or even playing games at the local fairground , consider if the `` made in china '' label imprinted on those inflatable beach balls , shirt buttons , and cuddly teddy bears perhaps connects all the way to one of the commodity city booths . `` i believe that more and more , we are defining our environments not as the spaces themselves , in terms of the buildings or architecture , but rather by the objects and devices that we buy and surround ourselves with . ... i would like that message to carry through universally , '' seymour said . richard john seymour is a photographer based in london . you can follow him on instagram and twitter .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the estimated number of people killed in eastern ukraine since april 2014 now exceeds 6,000 `` in spite of successive ceasefires , '' the un human rights office announced in a statement on monday . the escalation in fighting in recent weeks , particularly near donetsk airport and in the debaltseve area , resulted in hundreds of deaths , both civilian and military , according to a new report . the report paints a picture of `` merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure , '' said un high commissioner for human rights zeid ra'ad al hussein . he called for all sides to adhere to the minsk agreement , which calls for a ceasefire in many of the conflict 's hotspots . the fighting has inflicted extreme humanitarian hardship on civilians . `` many have been trapped in conflict zones , forced to shelter in basements , with hardly any drinking water , food , heating , electricity or basic medical supplies , '' zeid said in a statement . the notion that civilians remained in the conflict zone of their own will is `` misguided , '' he said . `` many people stay because they fear for their lives if they try to move . many others stay to protect children , other family members , or their property . and some are forced to stay against their will , or are simply physically unable to leave , '' zeid said . a series of terror attacks in mariupol , as well as in kharkiv and odesa , which are outside of the conflict zone , have set a bad precedent , he said . `` should this trend continue , this would represent a new and very deadly chapter in this conflict , expanding the areas where the rule of law and the protection of human rights are effectively absent , '' zeid said . the un arrived at the new estimated death toll of over 6,000 by tallying 5,809 documented deaths and assessing that many more must have been killed in recent fighting in other areas , particularly donetsk airport and around debaltseve .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- she grew up in kenya under colonial rule , when women did n't get an education . now in her 90s , priscilla sitienei is changing that , attending elementary school -- and inspiring a generation . she started five years ago as a kindergartner at a boarding school near eldoret . she 's in fourth grade today . `` i had grandchildren and great-grandchildren who shunned school , '' she says by phone from ndalat . `` that made me mad . i decided i have to show them that education is important . '' during colonial times , some kenyan hospitals did not keep birth records . sitienei 's exact age is unclear , but she says she was born around 1923 , when a famine plagued her hometown . growing up , relatives told her she barely survived that famine as a toddler , which gave her a rough estimate of her birth year . if confirmed by the guinness world records , she would be the oldest pupil in elementary school . the last such honor by the guinness world records went to another kenyan , kimani maruge , who in 2004 was named the oldest person to begin primary school . five years later , he died at age 90 . though sitienei worked as a traditional midwife for decades , she says there 's still a lot to learn . `` my favorite subject is math , '' the nonagenarian says . `` now that i 'm in school , i know the right dosage to give the women who i help deliver their babies . '' sitienei got married at a young age and focused on raising her 10 children . `` i could not go to school even if i wanted , '' she says . `` in my time , educating a woman was considered a waste of time and money .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- around 2002 , i was browsing in a used book store in pittsburgh , and there it was : `` the ethics of star trek '' by judith barad and ed robertson . coincidentally , i was working at that time on integrating ethics into engineering education at penn state university . i immediately bought the book , and after reading it through , realized that it could be the basis for an engaging course for our first-year engineering students . i first offered the course , the ethics of star trek , in the fall of 2003 -- and i 've been teaching it ever since . my children grew up watching the shows that followed the original series , which continued the tradition established by `` star trek '' creator gene roddenberry of tackling current events like war , genocide and pollution . it was good family entertainment that also prompted reflection on issues of the day . and it was this exploration of both space and the issues of the day that inspired me to try to apply these moral lessons to students . first there was the friendship between captain kirk , mr. spock , and dr. mccoy , aka bones . plato described the human soul as composed of three aspects : spirit , reason and emotion . internally , we each strive to balance these three forces . if we manage to do this well , we become a more virtuous person and attain a fourth virtue : justice . by placing kirk -lrb- spirit -rrb- , spock -lrb- reason -rrb- and bones -lrb- emotion -rrb- into challenging situations , we get to observe this interplay of these forces , and we get to hear them say what would otherwise be an internal dialogue . why is spock so critical here ? because vulcans worship logic and rationality . even though he 's half human , he suppresses his emotions . it 's no surprise that he is the science officer , since science is founded on rationality . mr. spock , then , can be trusted to give reasoned scientific analysis in any situation , uninfluenced by emotion or spirit . and since they would n't even be in space without science , spock may be the most important character for the success of the adventure . so , how was all this applied in a classroom ? the `` star trek class '' is a one-credit seminar for first-year students that meets once a week , one of about 60 different seminars offered by the college of engineering . students read relevant chapters in the book , and then every other week we watch a related `` star trek '' episode . in the other weeks , we sit in a large circle and have an open and often lively discussion about the ethical ideas and their application to the students ' lives . one of the recurring plot elements in `` star trek '' is the discovery of new creatures . this often raises the question of the proper relationship and attitude toward these entities . are they intelligent ? is their intent malicious ? in one episode , `` arena , '' the enterprise engages in battle with an alien vessel , flown by the gorn , that has attacked an earth colony . in the heat of the battle , another unknown species , the metrons , transports kirk and the gorn captain to a barren planet . they are told that because of their violent tendencies , they must battle to the death , with the ship and crew of the loser to be destroyed . as the two captains battle , the metrons project the scenes onto the enterprise 's main view screen on the bridge . as the crew observes the battle , and thinks more about it , spock realizes that the earth colony may have been the invader , and the gorn vessel may have been justified in its attack on the colony . kirk also begins to see this as a possibility . when he finally subdues the gorn captain , kirk decides to show him mercy and spare his life , even though it may result in the destruction of the enterprise and her crew . surprised by this action , the metrons decide that there may be hope for humans after all , and that we are not primarily savages . this episode has been used in the following week 's discussion in various ways , depending on the current events that form the backdrop to the semester . one of my favorite approaches is to have the students consider the ethics of eating meat . i supplement the `` star trek '' background with arguments by other philosophers and commentators . it always makes for great discussion because the question hits home , literally , in the gut . at the heart of this question is : what is it about another creature that qualifies it for ethical consideration ? is it rationality ? is it power ? is it utility to humans ? many of the students ' arguments are essentially biological -- we are omnivores . they argue further that we are at the top of the food chain and can therefore do whatever we want . for these students , i often start by asking them if they have a pet . if they do , i ask them if i can eat their pet . or better yet , under what circumstances might it be ok to eat their pet ? a key issue that arises from this is that we humans see ourselves as more than just animals ; we have reason and a sense of right and wrong , a sense of justice . as the discussion evolves , various indicators of other species ' moral standing are investigated , including rationality , ability to experience pain and suffering , utility to humans , and perhaps that these other creatures have intrinsic value regardless of their use to people . often , students come away with a commitment to reduce animal suffering , and to reduce their consumption of meat overall . my favorite spock-centered episode is a two-parter , `` the menagerie , '' which uses scenes from the original pilot , `` the cage . '' here we see spock 's human side at its best . captain pike , whom spock used to serve with , has been injured to the point where he can live only as part of a machine , and he can only make a device beep once for yes , and twice for no . -lrb- ok , admittedly it 's a flaw in the technological imagination . -rrb- spock kidnaps pike and commandeers the enterprise , all for as yet unclear reasons . what we find out is that pike and spock had visited a planet -lrb- in the pilot -rrb- where aliens could make you experience any reality they dreamed up for you . they narrowly escaped , and the planet was placed off limits by the federation . spock intends to deliver pike to this planet so that he can live out his life in a reality unconfined by his physical impairment . along the way , spock faces a court-martial where a guilty verdict would result in death . yet his loyalty and love of pike override his awareness of the irrationality of his actions . -lrb- in the end , the court-martial is dropped , and pike lives long and prospers . -rrb- . nearly every episode had a moral lesson or dilemma like this , meaning that not only was `` star trek '' great entertainment , but a show that could really make you think . that 's why i was saddened to learn of leonard nimoy 's passing friday . but it is also something that allows me to take some comfort , because i know that his legacy as mr. spock , science officer of the starship enterprise , will live on .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- boris nemtsov , the russian opposition leader slain friday night a stone 's throw from the kremlin , was a true original , one of the towering figures of his country 's post-communist political odyssey . we do not know yet who it was who shot him four times in the back . various theories have been floated . but by far the most plausible is that his killers wanted to silence one of the most determined and courageous russian campaigners for personal and political freedoms . whether nemtsov offended by attacking the authoritarianism of vladimir putin 's regime , the jingoistic imperialism of his ukrainian campaign or even the massacre of journalists at charlie hebdo , it comes to the same thing in the end : he stood up consistently for the values of the western enlightenment against its motley army of enemies . born in the black sea resort of sochi , nemtsov began as an atomic physicist but rose to prominence in the early 1990s as the reformist governor of nizhny novgorod province . president boris yeltsin took a liking to him and brought him to moscow . `` what a stubborn nature , '' he wrote of nemtsov . `` reminds me of myself . '' nemtsov was the first person yeltsin anointed as his political successor . -lrb- unfortunately , he was not the last . -rrb- . after putin 's election in 2000 , nemtsov hoped at first that the new president would keep his promise to restore order while preserving democracy . soon disillusioned , nemtsov became one of putin 's most biting critics . he was a natural politician -- emotional , gregarious , articulate . like yeltsin -- but unlike putin -- he enjoyed meeting ordinary people and was energized by electoral campaigns . some snickered at nemtsov 's extravagant personality , his hints of bravado and weakness for the fairer sex . but his determination and talent commanded respect . yet it is also true that , by the mid-2000s , nemtsov was widely viewed as a spent force . and when the levada center polled russians in 2013 , 6 % approved of his actions , while 48 % disapproved and 46 % claimed to know nothing about him . along with all other russian liberals of the 1990s , he failed to forge a connection to the discontented groups outside moscow . he titled his first book of memoirs , `` the provincial , '' but to true provincials he looked like the elite . as one analyst told me , when nemtsov turned up at far-flung rallies in a sparkling , immaculately ironed , white shirt , it symbolized the class divide between him and his audience . by the wave of protests in 2011-12 , his generation 's day had passed . the new activists in their 30s and 40s had a different sensibility , a new cadence of speech to fit the internet age . on the stage before the anti-putin demonstrators , nemtsov often bombed . he understood this . `` khvatit ! '' he said , in his last interview , when the host tried to tease out of him a confession of presidential ambitions . `` enough already ! '' but the dwindling appeal of western-style liberalism did not stop him . nemtsov 's doggedness during the last decade -- plugging away despite public indifference or scorn -- makes it the most impressive chapter of his career . having been chauffeured to his government office in the 1990s , nemtsov marched in the rain among bedraggled crowds in the 2000s as police wheeled out noise-making machinery to drown out the sound of his bullhorn . he endured the eggs and ammonia hurled at him by pro-kremlin hooligans . not shrinking from arrest , he spent more than a few nights in holding cells . even as the boyish charmer turned into a graying baby boomer with reading glasses that slipped down his nose , nemtsov refused to slacken . shut out of national politics , he ran for mayor of sochi -- and got 13.6 % of the vote . -lrb- even had the election been fair , he would probably have lost . -rrb- undeterred , he won a seat as deputy in the yaroslavl regional council . swallowing his pride , he battled on because he cared about russia and because , well ... politics was what he did . the killing comes at a time when the kremlin is clearly nervous . with the ruble and growth rate both plunging , glimmers of opposition have already appeared in unexpected corners . five deputies in the usually subservient duma have tabled a bill to repeal the sanctions putin slapped on european food imports , calling them unconstitutional . if the economic slide continues , putin 's high ratings are likely to fall . in undemocratic states , the killing of a major opposition figure is sometimes the spark that lights the fuse . in the philippines , after ferdinand marcos ' military thugs shot benigno aquino on the tarmac at the manila airport , this set off the `` people 's power '' movement that eventually swept the dictator from office . the murder of orlando letelier by augusto pinochet 's agents helped to discredit the chilean leader . and yet russia is in a poisonous state of division . the country 's westernized fringe may be galvanized into opposition . but as war fever bleeds into economic anxiety , a pervasive resentment and directionless aggression seem more likely in the short run than a united uprising for civil and political rights . meanwhile , the wait for answers continues . the attack took place in an area saturated with video cameras . within hours , one television station was showing footage of the killing -- albeit from a considerable distance . nemtsov was almost certainly under surveillance at the time . if the kremlin did not know before , it very likely knows by now who the killer was . its next decision will be how to use the information for its own purposes . whether or not the actual perpetrators are caught and punished , all know who created the climate of hatred in which liberal politicians are likened to `` jackals who hang around foreign embassies '' and a `` fifth column '' of traitors . nemtsov in his later years was never a threat to putin 's regime . hardly a radical revolutionary , he cooperated with the authorities to avoid violence by moving the site of the first major moscow demonstration in december 2011 , and he participated in discussions with then-president dmitry medvedev about reforms of the political system . having come to symbolize for most russians the disorder of the 1990s , he had little chance of rising to the top again . indeed , he was the kind of liberal -- unbowed , unabashedly pro-western , unpopular -- whom the kremlin loved to hate . now it will have to find somebody else .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- we ca n't settle iphone vs. android or `` star wars '' vs. `` star trek '' for you . but we can settle another long-running geek debate : . those short , animated loops that have captivated the web for decades ? they 're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter . steve wilhite created the graphics interchange format , or gif , while working for compuserve in 1987 . when he received a webby award in 2013 for it , and delivered his five-word acceptance speech -lrb- that 's all the webbys allow -rrb- , he flashed a gif on the big screens at the cipriani wall street in new york . and , in a flash , it all became clear : . `` it 's pronounced jif , not gif . '' of course , in the grand tradition of heated debate , a flat statement of fact by the creator was n't enough to sway some partisans . on twitter , `` gif '' became a trending topic as some folks pushed back . `` graphics interchange format . graphics . not jraphics . #gif #hardg , '' wrote web designer dan cederholm . `` so instead of gif , we 've got to say jif ? yeah right , '' chimed in october jones , creator of the `` texts from dog '' tumblr and book . `` and i suppose those animals with long necks are called ` jiraffes .

hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- australia 's transport safety chief has always described himself as a pessimist . but martin dolan , chief commissioner of the australian transport safety bureau , says that as search teams scour the depths of the indian ocean for any sign of malaysia airlines flight mh370 , he is confident they will find the plane , if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking . `` if anything , i 'm slightly more optimistic than six months ago , because we have more confidence in the data , and we have proven the search equipment and techniques work to the necessary standards , '' dolan said . but as the first anniversary of mh370 's disappearance approaches , with no trace of the missing plane found , not everyone shares his outlook . that includes many of the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board , who say not a single day goes by without wondering what happened to their loved ones . and for many , the decision in late january by malaysia to officially declare mh370 an accident , enabling the insurance payout process to begin in accordance with international protocol , was painfully premature . `` how can they say that , when there is no proof that the plane has crashed ? '' asked wen wang cheng , whose son wen yung sheng was one of 153 chinese nationals on board . `` we have to get the facts , '' wen said . what families have been told , they say , simply is n't good enough . anger , frustration , and distrust pushed some relatives , including wen , to fly from china to kuala lumpur last month , to demand more . but when families submitted a letter to malaysia airlines asking for authorities to explain the declaration and status of the investigation , a written response from the company 's ceo revealed little that had n't already been said . at 12:41 a.m. local time on march 8 , 2014 , malaysia airlines mh370 took off from kuala lumpur international airport , en route to beijing . less than an hour later , the boeing 777-200er was flying over the south china sea . air traffic controllers in malaysia radioed the crew to contact controllers in ho chi minh city for its onward journey through vietnamese airspace . the crew acknowledged the request , thanking kuala lumpur controllers with a routine reply : `` good night , malaysian three-seven-zero . '' minutes later , the plane disappeared from radar . malaysian authorities revealed days later that military radar had tracked the plane as it turned back to the west , flew across the malay peninsula , and up the strait of malacca , before flying out of radar range and vanishing once again . the search area widened , then shifted off the coast of western australia , when it was determined through careful analysis of a series of messages or `` handshakes '' between the plane and an inmarsat telecommunications satellite , that mh370 eventually turned south , and flew for hours into the indian ocean . roughly a week 's sail from the coast of western australia , ships with specialists and equipment capable of searching depths that regularly exceed 4,000 meters -lrb- 13,123 feet -rrb- , work around the clock , methodically ticking off sections of sea floor . in early february a new ship , the fugro supporter , joined the search carrying the hugin 4500 , a programmable unmanned submarine , now scanning areas that other equipment could n't safely cover , including steep mountain slopes . the ship joins the discovery and fugro equator , both operated by a dutch survey firm , along with the malaysian-contracted go phoenix . `` i asked specifically to come on this job , because it 's a very exciting opportunity to do something that will potentially help a lot of people , '' james hancock , a surveyor who usually works in the oil industry in the north sea , told cnn 's anna coren , as he prepared to embark on a trip on the fugro discovery that could last up to six weeks . since october , more than 24,000 square kilometers -- roughly 40 % of what the atsb calls the `` priority search area '' -- has been scanned , with the remainder of the work scheduled to be finished by may before weather conditions worsen as the southern winter approaches . for now , teams are searching mostly using devices called towfish , which are dragged close to the ocean floor on cables up to 10 kilometers long . it 's tough work , even when conditions are perfect . a number of cyclones , producing waves of up to 16 meters , put the brakes on the search in early february . dolan is careful to point out search efforts are meeting or exceeding expectations , dismissing concerns over stormy weather or delays in installing equipment as `` part of the deal . '' the current search area is the result of months of analysis and reexamination of satellite data by an international team of experts , combined with aircraft performance factors such as fuel range , speed , and altitude . search ships are focused along the so-called 7th arc , or `` partial handshake , '' where international investigators believe the plane ran out of fuel . `` the thing that really impresses me most about this investigation was how much information we were able to gain through mathematics and science , '' said cnn safety analyst david soucie . but soucie , a former faa accident investigator , is not optimistic that the deep-sea search teams will find what they 're looking for . `` i know that they 've searched in the most probable areas where it would have been , and it 's not there , '' he said . jeff wise , a science journalist and author of `` the plane that was n't there , '' took that skepticism a step further , saying it 's time to reexamine all the clues . his latest theory contends that investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the inmarsat satellite data , and that mh370 may have instead flown north toward kazakhstan . `` this is not a normal investigation . they need to throw out the book , '' said wise . `` this is unlike anything that 's happened in aviation . '' but michael exner , an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry , says the data `` accurately and unambiguously '' shows mh370 went down near the 7th arc . `` the current atsb search strategy remains the best search strategy , '' exner said . `` they are looking exactly where i expect the plane to be found . '' the atsb 's dolan cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone . `` we have n't given up . quite the opposite , '' he said . if search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of mh370 , australia , which has been leading the search at malaysia 's request , will also lead salvage and recovery efforts , according to the atsb chief commissioner . but malaysia , australia , and china , which had the majority of the passengers on board the flight , have not yet made a decision on whether a recovery will occur , dolan said . it is unclear what will happen if search teams complete their current mission without finding any sign of the plane . australia has allocated roughly $ 48 million to the current phase of the search , with malaysia promising to contribute equally to the cost . in january , the malaysian government said it is committed `` to continue all reasonable efforts to bring closure to this unfortunate tragedy . '' one possibility is that the deep-sea search could be extended outside the boundaries of the current priority area , north or south along the 7th arc . the atsb would not comment on the likelihood of expanding the search , saying that it was a `` decision for governments . '' malaysia also plans to release an interim statement detailing the progress of the investigation into mh370 around march 8 -- though some experts believe it will not contain any information investigators do not already have . aviation experts say there is a key reason the search should continue until mh370 is found . `` without knowing what caused it , you ca n't fix it , you ca n't make sure it does n't happen again , '' said soucie . `` and i think that 's really the biggest tragedy of this , if they do n't find the airplane . '' for the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board , who have had nothing but hope and prayers to carry them through the past year , it 's about finding answers . `` it 's very difficult to hear the world closure , when there is no closure , '' jacquita gonzales , the wife of lead steward patrick gomes , told cnn 's andrew stevens . and while gonzales says she holds out hope her husband could return home alive , she is prepared for a difficult discovery . `` if it 's there and there 's debris , we can have closure and we can lay him at peace . because i do n't think he 's at peace right now . '' the search for mh370 continues . cnn 's andrew stevens , anna coren , tim schwarz , felicia wong , chieu luu , and judy kwon contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- she was the first person to contract ebola in the united states , and now she 's suing the hospital where she got infected . nina pham , a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital dallas , filed a lawsuit monday against the hospital 's parent company , texas health resources . she claims the company made her `` a symbol of corporate neglect -- a casualty of a hospital system 's failure to prepare for a known and impending medical crisis . '' thr ignored ebola warnings , its chief medical officer `` made numerous patently false statements to congress , '' and the company `` wholly failed to ensure that appropriate polices , procedures , and equipment were in place , '' leaving health care providers untrained , unprotected and at risk for exposure , the lawsuit says . `` i was hoping that thr would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital , and the things they did n't do that led to me getting infected with ebola , '' pham said in a statement . `` but that did n't happen and i felt i was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help . '' the company 's ceo , barclay berdan , sent a letter to employees monday night after news of the lawsuit broke . `` nina and so many others of you served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of ebola to arrive in a u.s. hospital 's emergency room , '' the statement read . `` texas health resources values our strong culture of caring and compassion , and we view all employees as part of our family . that 's why we have continued to support nina both during and after her illness , and it 's why she is still a member of our team . '' according to the suit , the hospital chain failed to provide proper training to handle ebola . pham contracted the disease last fall while treating thomas eric duncan , who started showing symptoms after arriving in dallas from liberia . `` in a cruel twist , after watching mr. duncan go through the horrific and painful course of the disease as she desperately tried to save his life , nina herself was diagnosed with ebola just two days after mr. duncan 's life was taken by it , '' the lawsuit states . because the hospital initially discharged duncan when he arrived seeking treatment , it hurt his chances of beating the virus , the lawsuit says . `` had thr heeded the cdc and other warnings and ensured its hospitals were ready for ebola , mr. duncan would have had the best opportunity to possibly survive , '' it says . pham also claims that the hospital failed to provide her with the necessary protective equipment , despite cdc warnings . `` based on what she could learn from the internet , on the first day she cared for mr. duncan , nina put on a regular isolation gown covering her front and back , double gloves , a surgical mask with plastic shield and double booties . importantly , nina 's neck and hair remained exposed . nina was not even -lrb- provided -rrb- disposable scrubs or a change of clothes . she had to wear the scrubs she wore that first day home , taking out of the hospital clothing that was potentially carrying the virus , '' the lawsuit says . when her mother learned she was treating duncan , she tried to persuade her to call in sick or even quit , but pham replied , `` mom , i ca n't abandon him . he is my patient . it 's my job . i 'm going back , '' according to the lawsuit . texas health resources spokesman wendell watson issued a statement in response to the lawsuit : . `` nina pham served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of ebola to arrive in a u.s. hospital 's emergency room . texas health resources has a strong culture of caring and compassion , and we view all our employees as part of our family . that 's why we have continued to support nina both during and after her illness , and it 's why she is still a member of our team . as distressing as the lawsuit is to us , we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with nina . '' comparing the conditions facing nurses to what one would expect in a poorly developed country , the suit further states that after duncan died , pham was told she was at `` no risk '' for ebola `` and that she could freely see her friends and family . '' two days later , she found out she had ebola . `` thr quickly learned that nina and her dog bentley had enormous public support and sympathy . so thr began trying to use nina as a pr tool to save its plummeting image . while nina laid in isolation , heavily medicated and facing a potentially gruesome death , thr had its pr department calling nina . the pr department was trying to release information and use nina as part of its thr-corporate-driven #presbyproud campaign , '' the lawsuit says . pham 's lawsuit also says texas health resources violated her privacy by sharing her medical records . in his letter to employees , berdan said the company had pham 's permission to release information . `` thr was sensitive to nina 's privacy , and we adhered to hipaa -lrb- health insurance portability and accountability act -rrb- rules in determining what information to share publicly , '' the ceo said . `` we had nina 's consent to share the information about her that was released . '' another nurse treating duncan , amber vinson , also contracted ebola . both nurses recovered after being sent to hospitals specially equipped and staffed to handle ebola -- pham at the national institutes of health in maryland , and vinson at emory university hospital in atlanta . pham is still employed and is getting a paycheck from texas health resources , but has not returned to work , cnn affiliate ktvt said . she is still suffering fatigue and body aches , but her lawyer told the affiliate it 's not clear whether the ailments are from ebola or from the experimental drugs pham received . she also experiences anxiety and frequent nightmares and suffers from the stigma of being the ebola nurse and she may not nurse again , the lawsuit says . `` professionally , she doubts whether she can ever be a critical care nurse again -- in part because of the emotional stress and anxiety over the trauma she experienced and in part because of the fear and stigma that follows her . so despite only just beginning to pursue her dream of a career in critical care nursing , nina is now faced with the possibility of never returning to her passion , '' the lawsuit says . the lawsuit seeks damages for past and future physical pain , mental anguish , physical impairment , loss of enjoyment of life , medical expenses , loss of earning capacity and loss of reputation the lawsuit says . it does not set an amount for damages sought . `` the fact is , i 'm facing a number of issues with regard to my health and my career and the lawsuit provides a way to address them , '' pham said in her statement . `` but more importantly , it will help uncover the truth of what happened , and educate all health care providers and administrators about ways to be better prepared for the next public health emergency . `` i particularly want to express my continued sympathy to the family of mr. duncan , as it was my privilege to care for him . i also want to acknowledge my fellow nurses , and the many friends , family and strangers for their ongoing concern and support .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- when jeb bush spoke last week at the conservative political action conference in national harbor , maryland , the likely gop presidential hopeful did better than expected . of course , that could have been because expectations were so low . you remember `` bush derangement syndrome . '' when george w. bush was president , it afflicted liberals who thought the chief executive could n't do anything right . now that jeb might run for president in 2016 , the condition vexes conservatives who believe that when it comes to choosing the gop nominee , the former florida governor is all wrong . during bush 's speech , a few dozen supporters of sen. rand paul of kentucky -- wearing red t-shirts with the words `` stand with rand '' -- walked out and later blasted bush as insufficiently conservative . but what should really count for a lot is that bush is sufficiently competent . he 's the grownup in a roomful of extremists who -- as they compare union members to isis -lrb- scott walker -rrb- or vow to abolish the irs -lrb- ted cruz -rrb- or bash the media -lrb- chris christie -rrb- -- seem most interested in applause lines . bush is a serious person with a serious shot at the presidency , something that you just ca n't say about all republicans who appear to be running . as someone who is bilingual and whose wife hails from mexico , bush can hit hillary clinton , the likely democratic nominee , where it hurts by carving into her latino support . in his 1998 gubernatorial election , and 2002 re-election , bush received over 60 percent of the latino vote . and it 's no secret that , for many latinos who might vote for bush , the make-or-break issue is immigration . that 's because many latinos see immigration as a way of determining a candidate 's character . latinos will be watching to see if bush stands up to the pressure from extremists to join the gop 's closed border chorus . they 're used to being thrown under the bus by politicians who sacrifice latinos to gin up support from non-latinos . and they wo n't put up with it . so which way is bush going to go on immigration ? for many years , he extolled the contributions of immigrants and expressed dismay that elements of his party are closed-minded and mean-spirited on the issue . he even acknowledged that , to many , the party is seen as `` anti-immigrant . '' lately , though , bush has injected more nuance into his views -- and turned them mushy in the process . on the question of whether undocumented youth should have a path to citizenship , for example , bush at first supported the idea , then he opposed it . and most recently , he has said that he could support such a path if congress mandates it . on the arizona immigration law , bush apparently likes the concept of enlisting local police to be `` the eyes and ears '' of the border patrol . but he has also been sympathetic to critics who worry that this will lead to ethnic profiling of latinos . too often , bush leaves the impression that he 'll say whatever he needs to say to avoid conflict . so it was actually refreshing to see bush use his appearance at cpac -- which took the form of an onstage interview by conservative talk show host sean hannity -- to once again speak plainly . in response to questions , bush emphasized the need to secure the u.s. border , insisted that immigration policy should be driven by economic concerns and the need for high-skilled immigrants , and reaffirmed support for giving undocumented immigrants driver 's licenses and in-state tuition at public colleges and universities . the crowd booed that last one . bush criticized president obama 's executive actions to prioritize deportations , but also bashed republicans in congress for protesting that policy by holding up funds for the department of homeland security . finally , in response to what is often the most contentious aspect of this debate , bush also stressed the need to create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants who are currently in the united states . `` i know there 's disagreement here , '' he said . `` the simple fact is that there is no plan to deport 11 million people . we should give them a path to legal status where they work ... and contribute to our society . '' more boos . the way bush sees it , the gop is good at being against things but `` we have to start being for things again . '' in response to a heckler , bush stared out into the crowd to address his critic . `` i 'm marking you down as neutral , '' he told the heckler . `` i 'll look forward to being your second choice . '' not even close . in the washington times/cpac presidential preference straw poll of 3,007 participants , bush came in fifth out of 17 candidates with just 8 percent of the vote . first place went to rand paul , who earned 25.7 percent . clearly , bush has a long way to go in convincing conservatives that he 's their best choice . but his appearance at cpac set exactly the right tone . voters in both parties have plenty of candidates telling them what they want to hear just to get their support . what they need are more candidates who tell them what they need to hear : the truth . that wo n't make the candidates popular . but it does make them credible . score 1 for bush .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's time for leaders in israel and the united states to call off their war of insults before they cause serious , lasting damage . heading into prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's address on tuesday to a joint session of congress , both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire . the speech itself is a terrible mistake . arranging it without prior consultation with the white house was not only an affront to barack obama but to the presidency itself . one would have thought that after all the uproar , netanyahu would have caught a `` cold '' and postponed , but now that he plans to go ahead , he should at least give a measured , thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known . but let 's be clear : he also deserves a respectful hearing in congress from both sides of the aisle . blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in america as well as in israel . this conflict began on a personal level . those close to obama and netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another . obama , they say , regards netanyahu as headstrong , bombastic and reckless . netanyahu sees obama as weak , unreliable and priggish . the obama team also accuses netanyahu of timing his congressional speech to rally israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- bibi as churchill standing up to the nazis -- while netanyahu 's team is convinced obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the nobel laureate who brought peace . each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press . but in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off iran 's aggressive push to become a nuclear power . the iranian threat has long been vexing ; former defense secretary bob gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security . there are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties . the obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart , risking an armed showdown . the netanyahu government believes the agreement which obama appears ready to accept will let iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb . in truth , there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement . as obama believes , a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear iran . but what is alarming not only to israel but to other american friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the u.s. and its partners in the negotiation with iran -lrb- russia , china , the uk , france , germany -rrb- have made repeated concessions to get an iranian signature without getting major concessions in return . consider : the u.s. and israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against teheran . leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal , the u.s. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in iran -- 6,500 by latest count . washington and tel aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years . according to the latest leaks , the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the iranians a chance to bust loose . this is only the beginning of a long litany of differences . in defense of u.s. compromises , secretary of state john kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore , those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt . but administration critics are also right in arguing that the obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace , an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the middle east will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace . in times past , american and israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress . president jimmy carter could barely stand israeli leader menachem begin but they and egyptian president anwar sadat shaped the camp david accords in 1978 . despite sometimes bitter words during israel 's recent dust-up with hamas -- especially directed by israel against secretary kerry -- obama ensured that israel was well supplied militarily , particularly with the iron dome missile defense system that saved countless israeli lives . but today 's rift seems far more perilous . it is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the middle east . israel should remember that america is its best friend in a world where anti-semitism is once again raising its hideous head . the united states should appreciate that for israel , a nuclear iran could pose instant annihilation . america also has arab friends in the middle east who have vital interests here -- friends like saudi arabia who , if an agreement is weak , will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb , unleashing a lethal arms race . this is a moment that demands that leaders in both israel and the united states lower their voices , take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust . in private talks , they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them , starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran u.s. diplomats . dennis ross , for example , argues that if the u.s. could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere , any time in iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that iranian violations will bring military action , that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears . martin indyk proposes that , drawing upon ideas embraced by president clinton in middle east negotiations 15 years ago , the u.s. could enter a formal treaty with israel , voted upon by congress , that would provide a u.s. `` nuclear guarantee '' to israel in event of an iranian breakout . in short , the moment is dire but not hopeless . what is clearly needed is a cease fire . secretary kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction sunday when he said netanyahu is welcome to speak in the u.s. on tuesday . others should now take up the cause , recognizing that our real adversaries are not in tel aviv or washington but among those in teheran who support terror and mayhem across the middle east .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it looks like the republicans in congress have failed again . house republicans defeated a plan pushed by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to fund the department of homeland security , money that congressional republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn president obama 's executive order on immigration . mcconnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue . when speaker john boehner proposed an even narrower compromise , funding the department for only three more weeks , his caucus said no . the final bill provides funding for one more week , at which point congress needs to take up the issue again . yet from a different perspective , congressional republicans are achieving their goal . once again they are using up a valuable chunk of president obama 's political time . congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions , such as economic inequality or climate change , which the white house hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the republicans refused to do anything about these problems . while the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim , president obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues , like tax reform , where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough . using up the legislative clock has been central to the republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections , a tactic that the democrats have found difficult to fight back against . the strategy has been pretty straightforward . each time that president obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation , whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality , republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy . this is what republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if democrats did not accede to their budget demands . congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default . this was all that anyone in washington was talking about . the gop did the same with the threat of a government shutdown . even though the possibility of repealing the affordable care act is remote , republicans keep bringing it up for a debate , forcing democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing . the `` tea party '' faction of the house republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week . since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles , and that they wo n't allow boehner to rein them in for `` practical '' political considerations , democrats ca n't afford to take the threats lightly . republican leaders can and have said to the white house they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems , but with a nod to the republican caucus , remind obama that they do n't have full control . while it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the gop and place republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016 , many congressional republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar . aside from vetoing bills , president obama does n't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away . now the gop has done it again . even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the department of homeland security , months have been consumed on capitol hill . when the year began president obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year . he wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor , as well as the struggles facing middle class americans . but he has only had limited success . instead , he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill . when house republicans pushed their `` stop-gap '' measure to fund homeland security for just another week , they were following the standard game plan . by avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems , and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time , the gop continues to eat away at the president 's political clock . usually political extremism does not have the virtues that sen. barry goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the republican convention , but it sure can have short-term political benefits in congress . just ask mitch mcconnell , who can barely contain his grin .
jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- at times , he got raucous applause during his speech in washington on tuesday . but the reactions to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's message that may matter most came in israel and iran -- where emotions ran high , both in support and in opposition . in an address before the u.s. congress punctuated by one-liners , netanyahu claimed that ongoing talks about iran 's nuclear program `` would all but guarantee that iran gets nuclear weapons , lots of them . '' he portrayed iran 's leaders as untrustworthy and bloodthirsty , intent on annihilating israel and threatening its allies . that viewpoint , not surprisingly , did n't play well in tehran . while the speech was n't carried live , iranians quickly pounced with heated condemnations of netanyahu and characterized him as a liar . tv banners labeled the speech an example of `` iranaphobia , '' with commentators saying that it humiliated u.s. president barack obama and deepened the wedge between israel and its longtime allies . `` this speech was a sign of the weakness and extreme isolation of radical groups , '' iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman marzieh afkham said of what she called `` a deceitful theater play . '' '' ... the continued lies of netanyahu regarding the aims and intentions of the peaceful nuclear program of iran are repetitive and sickening , '' she said . the reaction in israel was more diverse , albeit predictable , reflecting the divisions there ahead of its march 17 election . isaac herzog -- the labor party chairman hoping to become israel 's next prime minister -- said that netanyahu 's speech , `` as impressive as it may be , did not prevent the iranians ' nuclear program '' nor did it impact talks now underway in montreux , switzerland , to address it . what the speech did accomplish , according to herzog , is `` greatly undermine ... the relationship between israel and the united states , '' with obama opposing netanyahu 's speech as a political move that threatened to thwart the nuclear talks . `` it will not change the position of -lrb- obama 's -rrb- administration and will only broaden the crisis of our great friend and our strategic ally , '' herzog said of the speech . `` that price , we will have to pay . '' on the other side of the debate are people such as danny danon , a former israel deputy defense minister . `` prime minister netanyahu sounded the alarm for the survival of our country , '' danon said from jerusalem . `` we are worried . and i am very proud of our prime minister , ... who said exactly what we feel : it is a bad deal . '' the speech and the reactions to it came ahead of a march 24 deadline in which negotiators from six world powers , plus iran , are trying to reach a long-term deal about iran 's nuclear program . that looming date is why netanyahu said he was compelled to address congress at the invitation of house speaker john boehner -lrb- and without the advance knowledge of obama -rrb- . prior to boarding a plane sunday in tel aviv , the prime minister called his foray to washington `` a crucial trip , even a historical one . '' the iranian nuclear deadline is n't the only one looming for netanyahu , or even the most immediate one . because of israeli elections in two weeks , the man who has called himself the `` messenger of all the people of israel '' might not be that for much longer . while it happened some 6,000 miles away , his speech in washington on tuesday could sway hearts and minds back home -- some admiring his strong leadership in protecting israel and others , like herzog , upset over how he has roiled relations with obama and undermined peace efforts . given israeli election guidelines , tv networks pulled herzog 's speech from air for fear it could be construed as campaigning . netanyahu 's remarks were on a 5-minute delay for the same reason . nachshon carmi said he is `` totally '' convinced netanyahu primarily aimed to speak to voters at home as much as to affect the american government 's decisions on iran . `` i think this is a classic move of distracting the voters from domestic issues to foreign policy , '' carmi said in jerusalem . a fellow israeli citizen , malynnda littky , disagrees . she thinks that netanyahu had every right to make his case in washington if he believes an iranian deal could affect israel 's future . `` he 's giving a speech on a topic he knows a lot about and is important to us , '' littky said . `` but it 's still just a speech . '' given longstanding issues with the palestinian territories and the fact that israel is surrounded by nations with predominantly muslim populations , israeli leaders have ample experience with being isolated and on the defensive . they 've also proven a willingness time and again to act out , if they feel doing so will safeguard their national security . iran has been a case in point . netanyahu has been the loudest voice in speaking about international efforts aimed at preventing iran from developing a nuclear weapon . if the rest of the world ca n't act to stop this from happening , he 's suggested , then israel will . there 's precedent about how that might be done : israel bombed iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 . at the time , then-prime minister menachem begin drew a line in the sand , essentially vowing that no israeli enemy could develop weapons of mass destruction and that israel would defend itself `` with all the means at our disposal . '' that mentality is what appears to be driving netanyahu , who has been adamant and consistent in expressing his distrust of iran -lrb- whose supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , tweeted last year that israel should be `` annihilated . '' -rrb- the prime minister has been just as forthright in challenging international efforts to strike a deal with tehran , an effort that 's been accelerated since a more conciliatory hassan rouhani became iran 's president in 2013 . several interim agreements have been made in recent months , though a long-term pact so far has been elusive . the switzerland talks aim to bridge `` gaps '' between the various parties , with iranian foreign minister javad zarif telling cnn on tuesday that `` we 're starting to move forward , but it 's a lot of work . '' so is netanyahu having a disruptive effect on these negotiations ? `` he 's trying to , '' zarif said . `` but i do n't think trying to create tension and conflict helps anybody . '' one thing that netanyahu has certainly done is get the attention of iranians . news about what happened in washington was the biggest item in iranian media and high on the minds of people on the streets of tehran . in addition to citizens and tv commentators , iranian officials took notice as well . but that does n't mean they are taking much stock in what netanyahu said . massoumeh ebtekar , iran 's vice president for environmental affairs , told afp from paris that she did n't think netanyahu 's opinion `` carries much weight . '' `` they are making their efforts to derail the deal , '' ebtekar said of israeli officials . `` but i think the more logical lobbies on both sides are looking forward to a solution . '' there is a widespread opinion in iran that netanyahu has long been singularly intent on going after iran , even before he started his second stint as prime minister in 2009 . his position is often conflated with that of the united states , a view that could be exacerbated by the loud reception netanyahu got as he entered the chamber of the u.s. house of representatives on tuesday and all the times cheers and applause interrupted his speech . of course , just because iranians are mindful of what netanyahu said does n't mean they will change their minds . changing minds in israel , ahead of the coming election , is another matter . whether tuesday 's speech will do that ca n't be ascertained until there 's credible polling after his remarks , or arguably once citizens go to the polls in two weeks . until then , polls from various israeli news outlets suggest a tight race . some project netanyahu 's likud party winning fewer seats than the so-called zionist alliance opposing him , though exactly who will end up as prime minister depends on which parties join forces after the votes are cast . most israelis do n't think that netanyahu has any hope of impacting opinions and policies out of iran with his speech , bar-ilan university professor eytan gilboa said . but many are worried about what gilboa calls the worst crisis in the decades-long relationship between israel and the united states , with tuesday 's speech doing little to help change the perception `` there is very little trust between '' obama and netanyahu . speaking from jerusalem , carmi said he understands the depth of this division but does n't think the damage is irreparable . `` the connection between israel and the united states goes so deep and is on so many levels , '' he said . `` yes , we 're going through a bad time . but we 'll get over it .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the case of a georgia woman , whose execution was postponed for a second time monday , is once again shining the national spotlight on one of the most fundamental questions we as a nation face : when do we put our own citizens to death ? but it 's an issue on which this country is all over the place . `` as it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken . '' that was justice anthony kennedy , writing for the majority in kennedy v. louisiana -lrb- 2008 -rrb- . you might think at first the department of justice is n't listening . after all , the u.s. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death , and not all of them involve a victim 's life being taken . they fall into three main categories : 1 -rrb- homicide offenses ; 2 -rrb- espionage and treason ; and 3 -rrb- nonhomicidal narcotics offenses . while most of them involve the death of a victim , not all of them do . but what happened to all that `` should n't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim 's life was not taken '' language from the supreme court ? does n't the department of justice have to listen to the supreme court ? they do , and they have . the department of justice has read the high court 's fine print in kennedy v. louisiana : `` our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons . we do not address , for example , crimes defining and punishing treason , espionage , terrorism , and drug kingpin activity , which are offenses against the state . as it relates to crimes against individuals , though , the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken . '' ah . as with most things , there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions . apparently , when we are talking about crimes against people , the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide-type crimes . if it 's a crime against the state , well , it 's game on . after all , treason is one of three crimes mentioned in the u.s. constitution , so there 's a good argument that the federal statute authorizing death for treason is `` constitutional '' -- because it 's actually in the constitution . -lrb- yet another reason why federal court is not a place where defendants want to be -- it 's no secret defense attorneys would rather be in state court , where the penalties are less severe and where everything is n't illegal -rrb- . while it varies from state to state , as a very general proposition , the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder . murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide , and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder . as another very general proposition in the states , murder -- plus something on top that makes it more egregious -- is what will qualify as a capital crime . it would be nice to say that capital murder in the states is always defined as an intentional killing , but even that has exceptions . in fact , in some states , you can be executed for a victim 's death even if you did n't actually pull the trigger and even if you never intended a death to result . if you commit an inherently dangerous felony , and a death results , you can be charged with `` felony murder , '' which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty . according to the supreme court , this is constitutional , as long as the defendant significantly participated in the felony and was recklessly indifferent to human life . ultimately , it 's nearly impossible to articulate a simple rule for determining which crimes our society deems worthy of the death penalty . society 's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving , and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes . as a general rule , horrific murders qualify , but sometimes a nonhomicide crime such as espionage qualifies . if you are in the armed forces , even more crimes can get you executed , such as desertion . that 's particularly paradoxical that we might order our military personnel to intentionally kill in times of war and then execute them -- as was the case of pvt. eddie slovik -- for refusing to intentionally participate in the killing . of course , we have long recognized that military justice requires a degree of martial discipline that the civilian world simply does n't . while the husband-wife execution of convicted spies -lrb- and nonkillers -rrb- julius and ethel rosenberg were certainly high profile at the time , the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died . so what exactly will earn you the death penalty ? the message is anything but clear . for crimes against the person , it has to be pretty awful : a killing plus something that makes it even worse than your garden variety homicide . if your crime is against the state , however , the supreme court will give the state some leeway in killing citizens .
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- four days after he was gunned down by an unknown assailant in the heart of moscow , former russian deputy prime minister and outspoken kremlin critic boris nemtsov was laid to rest tuesday in a ceremony attended by hundreds of mourners . his coffin was lowered into the ground at the troyekurovskoe cemetery before family , friends and dignitaries , after being carried in procession through moscow . mourners laid wreaths , some with ribbons in the colors of the russian flag , reflecting tributes to a man whom supporters called a true russian patriot . earlier , a stream of people took part in a somber memorial service at the sakharov center in moscow . some held flowers as they filed past the open casket of the prominent kremlin critic and paid respects to his mother , dina eydman , and his children anton and zhanna . hundreds more lined up in the cold outside . mikhail kasyanov , a former prime minister under president vladimir putin who is now a leading opposition figure and worked closely with nemtsov , was among the mourners to speak at the service . he said he believed nemtsov , known for his outspoken views , was killed out of revenge for his politics . he also said he thought the killers would be brought to justice , under the next government of russia if not the current one . the assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories . though politically marginalized in recent years , nemtsov was one of putin 's most vocal critics , and many suspect the kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement . putin has vowed to bring those responsible to justice . no one has yet been arrested and authorities have put forward a number of theories , including that the murder was an act of `` provocation '' intended to destabilize russia , that it was connected to the conflict in ukraine , that islamist extremists were involved or that it was linked to nemtsov 's international business affairs . the moscow investigative committee said in a statement on its website tuesday that `` all scenarios '' are being considered and that it is taking all necessary steps . `` eyewitness are being questioned , cctv footage is already being analyzed . evidence has been collected . a number of tests were carried out -- among them are ballistic , medical examination and trace evidence , '' it said . the memorial service was hosted by pavel sheremet , a russian journalist known for leaving a russian state tv channel in protest at the kremlin 's current policies on ukraine . other prominent russian figures at the service included deputy prime minister arkady dvorkovich , prime minister dmitry medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova , and former finance minister alexey kudrin . russian economist yevgeny yasin , who served as economy minister between 1994 and 1997 and is now an academic , said : `` nemtsov always said everything that others were afraid to say . '' evgeniya albats , editor-in-chief of the new times magazine , described nemtsov in a speech as an amazing friend and a fearless politician . she added , `` this murder is impossible to forgive . it 's on putin 's conscience . '' foreign dignitaries included u.s. ambassador to russia john tefft , who said nemtsov would be remembered as a russian patriot , and former uk prime minister john major . major told cnn : `` it 's clearly a very sad day for russians , it 's a very sad day for boris ' family , and i 'm personally extremely saddened by what has happened . `` i knew him in the 1990s , i admired him , i admired what he stood for , and i hope now a thorough investigation will determine who is responsible for this outrage . '' the opposition politician was shot friday night as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters -lrb- 330 feet -rrb- from the kremlin with his girlfriend , ukrainian model anna duritskaya , 23 . duritskaya -- the only known witness to the shooting -- left moscow for kiev late on monday . she had been staying at the apartment of an aide to nemtsov under constant police guard . her mother , inna duritskaya , told cnn on monday that her daughter faces constant psychological pressure from moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death . the moscow investigative committee said duritskaya was not detained while in moscow and that she was offered witness protection , which she turned down . duritskaya was free to leave at any point but wanted to give her testimony and contribute to the investigation process , `` understanding the important of it for the investigation , '' the statement said . `` it is needless to state how important her testimony is . '' edward lucas , a senior editor for the economist and a senior vice president at the center for european policy analysis , told cnn that the manner of nemtsov 's death was highly suspicious . `` the circumstances of his shooting point very much to official involvement , '' he said . `` if it was some random , ragtag extremist militia from eastern ukraine killing him , i doubt they would 've been able to do it with such precision in the heart of moscow . '' lucas also said that the recent history of politically motivated killings in russia suggested that the investigation would come to little . `` one of the signal things that they all have in common is that they are not cleared up . we have a lot of bluster at the time of the death , promises of investigation , but either the culprits are never found or the culprits who are found are very unconvincing ones and the people who gave the orders are never identified . '' meanwhile , he said , the kremlin continues to pump out propaganda which suggests opposition activists or those critical of russia 's involvement in ukraine are traitors to their country . some of nemtsov 's supporters accuse the kremlin , if not of direct involvement , of creating an atmosphere of hatred which fostered the killing . not everyone who hoped to attend nemtsov 's funeral has been able to do so . latvia 's former foreign minister and european parliament member sandra kalniete said she was denied entry to russia on monday night on spurious grounds . speaking to cnn by phone from moscow 's sheremetyevo international airport , kalniete said she was finally told she was refused entry `` according to russia 's code of law regarding the defense and security of the russian state and the general health of the public . '' she had intended to represent latvia and the european people 's party -- the biggest parliamentary group in the european parliament -- at the funeral , she said . `` like many i admired him , i admired his joyfulness and eloquence , '' kalniete said . `` my wish was not to cause any danger to russia . i just wanted to go to pay tribute to a political personality , boris nemtsov . '' the european people 's party said it was the third time a member of the european parliament had been stopped at the russian border . thousands of nemtsov supporters gathered sunday in moscow to mourn the death of the 55-year-old , who was deputy prime minister during president boris yeltsin 's administration in the 1990s . the event took place the same day nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in moscow decrying russia 's policies on ukraine . ukrainian president petro poroshenko said last weekend that nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to russian interests , ukraine 's state-run ukrinform news agency reported . putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said . the president also wrote to nemtsov 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the kremlin said . police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches , russia 's official sputnik news agency reported . the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater . russia 's investigative committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles -lrb- $ 49,000 -rrb- for information leading to the arrest of the killer . it said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity . cnn 's matthew chance and alla eshchenko reported from moscow and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's ivan watson , emma burrows and lucy pawle contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- nasa 's tractor-trailer sized dawn spacecraft will snuggle up to ceres on friday , getting close enough to be pulled into orbit and to complete the first mission to a dwarf planet . `` i 'm just delighted that dawn is now on the doorstep of ceres , '' jim green , director of nasa 's planetary science division said in a news conference on monday . dawn is expected to begin orbiting ceres around 7:20 a.m. et , but nasa says it may take an hour or two to confirm it . ceres was discovered in 1801 -lrb- pluto was n't found until 1930 -rrb- and was the first object found in our solar system 's main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter . it 's about 310 million miles from earth and was initially classified as planet , then later demoted to an asteroid , only to be reclassified again as a dwarf planet . the early images from dawn already have mission scientists excited . `` ceres has really surprised us , '' said carol raymond , dawn 's deputy principal investigator . `` the first images have produced some really puzzling features . '' one of the puzzles -- two bright white spots that showed up in photographs taken by dawn in february . `` these spots were extremely surprising to the team , and they have been puzzling to the team and to everybody who 's seen them . '' the spots are in a 57-mile wide -lrb- 92 kilometer -rrb- crater . the spot in the center of the crater is about twice as bright as the spot on the side of the crater . `` this extreme brightness was really unexpected , '' raymond said . the dawn team is `` really , really excited about this feature because it is unique in the solar system . '' raymond says the brightness is consistent with highly reflective materials such as ice or salts . this might help add more credence to a discovery made in 2014 by esa 's herschel infrared space observatory . the telescope detected water vapor around ceres coming from the same area where the spots are located . `` it might be related to that water vapor emission , '' raymond said . herschel 's scientists also said their research showed ceres has an atmosphere . raymond said her team is keen to confirm that . scientists expect to learn more as dawn is gradually lowered to about 235 miles above the surface of ceres in december . `` the mystery will be solved , '' she said . but ceres seems to have lots of oddities . `` we see many strange features , '' raymond said . `` we see smooth areas , some areas that are chaotically fractured and we see craters of all sizes . '' one of the other things scientists noticed is how round ceres is . being round is very important because it is the main characteristic of a planet -- a title that ceres had -- then lost . ceres was demoted to an asteroid because 19th century astronomers could n't be sure it was round . but it was bumped up to a dwarf planet when that category was created in 2006 . according to the international astronomical union -- the group that came up with the definition -- a dwarf planet is similar to the eight main planets -lrb- mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune -rrb- except it has a lot of other stuff orbiting with it around the sun . the iau recognizes five dwarf planets : eris , pluto , ceres , makemake and haumea . scientists say there could be many more of these small worlds that have n't been discovered . dawn was launched on september 27 , 2007 , from cape canaveral , florida . its journey has taken it past mars and on a short layover at the asteroid vesta . on friday , dawn will make its closest approach yet to ceres , flying about 25,000 miles from it , according to robert mase , project manager for the dawn mission at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california . `` that 's about 10 times closer than the moon is to the earth , '' he said . but the beautiful images coming in from dawn will stop for awhile . `` we 're now on the dark side , so we 're going to have a blackout for about the next month until we get back over toward the lit side of the body , '' he said . but he says the `` floodgates will open '' when its main science mission starts in april . dawn will stay in orbit around ceres for years , even after its primary mission ends in june 2016 . but at some point , it will run out of hydrazine , the fuel used to guide the spacecraft . between now and then -- mission managers hope dawn will help solve the mysteries of ceres and add to our knowledge of how our solar system formed .
kano , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- boko haram , the islamist extremist group already blamed for numerous horrific attacks in west africa , posted a graphic video online monday showing the apparent beheadings of two men who the group said were suspected spies . the six-minute video shows two men with their arms tied to their backs . they are made to face the camera on their knees , with another man towering over one of them brandishing a knife . the knife-wielding man reaches toward the throat of one of the kneeling men , then the video switches scenes to show what appear to be the bloody severed heads of the two men placed on their headless bodies . the site intelligence group , which monitors extremist activities , released a translated transcript from the video , including what site called an `` interrogation '' of one of the two men . the man identifies himself as a farmer from the nigerian town of baga . he says he was told by a policeman that if he provided information about `` the residents who live in here ... i will become rich and never go back to be a farmer again . '' the apparent beheadings then follow on the video . site said the video , which included arabic , english and french subtitles , was posted online via twitter and `` borrows certain elements from productions '' of beheadings by isis . the video was posted by the media division of boko haram , site said . although this is the first purported beheading video boko haram posted online . the group has previously issued more detailed and extremely violent beheading videos directly to journalists through intermediaries . unlike the video posted monday , previous ones have shown the actual decapitations . in october 2014 , boko haram handed out a 10-minute video showing the decapitation of a nigerian military pilot the group said it had seized a month earlier after shooting down his fighter jet during a mission against boko haram in northeast nigeria . in april 2014 , the islamist group released 16-minute video showing what it said was the beheading of a soldier its fighters captured in a battle in sambisa forest , the group 's main enclave . in february 2014 , another video showing the beheading of an alleged informant who led the military to a boko haram camp in sambisa forest during an offensive was issued by the group . and in february 2010 , boko haram released a 12-minute video in which two policemen were beheaded in an undisclosed location . those videos all ended with a speech from an `` executioner '' warning that the group would carry out similar punishment for anyone it captures supporting the nigerian government against it . observers of boko haram , which has inflicted years of terror on northern nigeria , note that its actions in the past six months have frequently mimicked those of isis -- from punishments such as stoning and beheading of its victims to taking territory and an increasingly sophisticated use of social media that 's very much in the isis `` style . '' jacob zenn , who follows boko haram 's operations and propaganda closely , recently told cnn , `` it 's clear boko haram is leaning toward isis in terms of doctrine , ideology and an emphasis on holding territory after operations . '' in terms of ideology , boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , has said that kidnappings and hostage-taking are approved in the quran , a claim isis also makes . `` our hostages are christians or corrupted muslims who follow the christian way , '' he said last year , referring to schoolgirls kidnapped in chibok , nigeria , most of whom remain missing . isis later referred to the chibok abductions in its kidnapping of hundreds of yazidi women and girls . zenn and other analysts point out that recent boko haram videos have resembled the polished media productions of isis . zenn notes they `` have the same choreography and lens angles as isis . '' boko haram has begun using isis symbolism in its media productions and operations . the nigerian press noted with alarm last july that boko haram militants had been seen raising isis ' rayat al-uqab flag along the nigerian-cameroon border . recent videos have featured the same flag . cnn 's tim lister contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- my name is mark goodacre , and i am a professor of new testament and christian origins in the department of religious studies at duke university . i was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on cnn 's `` finding jesus , '' which premiered sunday evening . i also appear in each episode of the program . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions to facebook during the show . below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them . vance lipsey : is there a better way to check the shroud than carbon dating ? i 've been told carbon dating is very inaccurate . goodacre : actually , carbon dating is an excellent way to ascertain the date of an artifact . many are disappointed , not surprisingly , that the shroud dated to between ad 1260 and 1390 . i recall my own disappointment -lrb- but not surprise -rrb- on hearing the results back in 1988 . but the scientists doing the carbon dating were not amateurs , and the samples were tested in three separate labs . moreover , the carbon date cohered with other evidence that the shroud was a medieval forgery , like the fact that there is no evidence of its existence until the 14th century . cynthia restivo : so i know the carbon dating was off , but was n't it later shown that the piece of cloth used for the testing was a section that had been repaired after some fire damage or something ? which would explain why it dated different ? goodacre : no , that 's not been established . those who defend the authenticity of the shroud often say the sample might have been taken from a part of the shroud that was repaired after it was damaged by fire in the 16th century . but this is special pleading . the scientists who took the sample knew what they were doing . professor christopher ramsey noted that the unusual weave on the sample matched the weave on the rest of the shroud perfectly . beth a hafele : so were jesus ' wrists nailed or his hands ? all shows and movies have his hands nailed . goodacre : one of the curiosities about the turin shroud is that the figure appears to be nailed through the wrists . this has long intrigued those who have studied crucifixion because there is some anatomical plausibility here -- nails through the wrists would support the body better than nails through the palms of the hands . it is just possible that the bones of the only crucified victim we have , jehohanan , show a nail mark above the wrist , but this is disputed . there are two further factors here . one is that victims of crucifixion may often have been tied instead of -lrb- or as well as -rrb- being nailed . also , some dispute whether the shroud figure is nailed through the wrists . -lrb- see antonio lombatti 's graphic . -rrb- . virginia mccoy : once again , mary magdalene is totally ignored . they used the gospel that described peter as having discovered the empty tomb . when other gospels describe magdalene as the one that discovered it and then she called out to others . goodacre : well , you will be pleased to hear that there is an entire episode devoted to mary magdalene in this series , and her identity and role are fully explored , including her presence at the empty tomb . i think you 'll enjoy it . jacques lemire : about the @cnn program on jesus . good stuff , but i am not sure about jesus crying out in pain . a psalm : the lamb is silent . goodacre : i found adam bond 's portrayal of jesus ' death in the drama really compelling , and his cry is quite arresting . it 's true that isaiah 53:7 says `` he was led like a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before its shearers is silent , so he did not open his mouth . '' many early christians saw this as a prophecy of the way that jesus , their messiah , died . it is apparently fulfilled in jesus ' silence during his trial -lrb- e.g. john 19:9 -10 -rrb- , but in all four gospels , jesus is vocal on the cross , and in the end he cries out with a loud voice -lrb- e.g. mark 15:34 and 37 -rrb- , so the drama makes good sense there . thanks again for watching and for all your great questions , and apologies that we could not answer all of them . i was really thrilled to be involved , and i loved working with the production team behind `` finding jesus . '' i think they have put together a superb series , which blends visually compelling drama and intelligent commentary from a wide range of experts . i look forward to hearing everyone 's reactions to the remaining five episodes !
-lrb- cnn -rrb- venezuela has given the u.s. embassy in caracas 15 days to downsize its staff from 100 personnel to 17 . `` with respect to bringing the number of staff at the u.s. embassy in venezuela to 17 , a period of 15 days will be given to decide which staff will stay in our country , '' said venezuela 's foreign minister delcy rodriguez on monday . venezuela 's official news agency avn -lrb- agencia venezolana de noticias -rrb- said the u.s. embassy has been asked to reduce its personnel to a staff of 17 to match the number of venezuelan personnel working in their embassy in the united states . last month , the u.s. government approved a law under which venezuelan officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their u.s. assets frozen . following that decision , venezuelan president nicolas maduro announced that that americans will need visas to visit venezuela . moreover , a group of prominent u.s. officials , current and retired , will be banned from entering venezuela because of what maduro said was their involvement in `` bombing iraq , syria and vietnam '' and other `` terrorist '' actions . the officials include george w. bush , former u.s. vice president dick cheney , former cia director george tenet and several current members of congress , including ileana ros-lehtinen , bob menendez and mario diaz-balart . on saturday , maduro also said an unspecified number of americans were arrested `` a few days ago '' for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities . the president said they included an american pilot of latin american origin , arrested in the southwest border state of táchira . he said the pilot was found in possession of `` all kinds of documents '' and was being interrogated by the authorities , though he did not identify him . the venezuelan government has made many similar claims in recent years , without ever substantiating them . `` there have been a lot of anti-american rhetoric again coming out of the venezuelan government with a lot of baseless allegations , '' said u.s. state department spokeswoman marie harf on monday .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- slain russian opposition leader boris nemtsov is n't the first critic of president vladimir putin to turn up dead . some putin opponents claim it is n't a coincidence that critics of the powerful leader and his government have been killed or landed behind bars . but the kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it 's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths . here 's a look at some cases of outspoken critics of putin 's government who 've ended up in exile , under house arrest , behind bars or dead . the business magnate backed an opposition party and accused putin of corruption . he spent more than 10 years behind bars on charges of tax evasion and fraud . in statements to cnn , khodorkovsky said his prosecution was part of a kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of yukos , the oil company he built from privatization deals in the 1990s . the kremlin denied the accusation . at the time of khodorkovsky 's sentencing , the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that `` allegations about some kind of selective prosecution in russia are groundless . russian courts deal with thousands of cases where entrepreneurs are prosecuted . '' due for release in august 2014 , he was released nearly a year earlier , in december 2013 , after putin signed an amnesty decree pardoning him . his release , along with the pardoning of dissident russian punk band pussy riot and a group of greenpeace protesters , was widely seen as an attempt to improve the country 's image before the winter olympics in sochi last february . khodorkovsky is now living in switzerland . he told cnn 's christiane amanpour last month that he wants to see regime change in his country . `` i think that my country does n't deserve a new era of authoritarianism , '' he said . `` but at the same time , i do n't want a revolution . '' she was a vocal critic of russia 's war in chechnya . her home was a safe place , until it became the scene of her murder . she was shot four times at the entrance of her moscow apartment in october 2006 . last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the killing . authorities alleged that an unidentified man asked lom-ali gaitukayev , whom the jury found was a mastermind of the slaying , to kill politkovskaya in exchange for $ 150,000 because of her reports of human rights violations and other issues , the moscow city court said . the new york-based committee to protect journalists said her work chronicling human rights abuses in chechnya led to threats against her and angered russian authorities . shortly after her death , putin denied any kremlin involvement in her killing , saying that politkovskaya 's `` death in itself is more damaging to the current authorities both in russia and the chechen republic ... than her activities . '' the former russian agent was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium , his tea spiked in a london hotel during a meeting with two former russian security servicemen . after leaving the russian federal security service , he blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to russia 's invasion of chechnya later that year . in a statement from his deathbed in london in november 2006 , he said he had no doubt about who was to blame for his imminent death . `` you may succeed in silencing me , but that silence comes at a price , '' litvinenko said at the time . `` you may succeed in silencing one man , but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate , mr. putin , in your ears for the rest of your life . '' officials have always dismissed the accusation as `` nonsense , '' but suspicions linger . a russian federal intelligence service spokesman went as far as to say that moscow had not carried out any `` physical liquidation of unwelcome personalities '' since the soviet era . the two prime suspects in the poisoning , andrei lugavoi and dmitry kovtun , are russian nationals . both are former agents of the russian security services . but both deny involvement , and the russian government refuses to extradite either to britain to face trial . in january 2009 , a masked man shot and killed markelov , a russian human rights lawyer known for his work on abuses by the russian military in chechnya . the gunman also shot baburova , a journalist from russia 's novaya gazeta newspaper , when she tried to intervene . markelov was known for his work on high-profile cases . he represented the family of a chechen woman killed by a former russian colonel in march 2000 . he held a news conference hours before his death opposing the early release of col. yury budanov , who had been convicted of strangling a chechen teenage girl and was freed after serving eight years of a 10-year sentence . at the time , novaya gazeta editor-in-chief dmitry muratov suggested that baburova was killed when she tried to stop the lawyer 's killer , but he said he could n't dismiss the possibility that she was also a target . russian authorities said members of a neo-nazi group were behind the killings , and two neo-nazis were convicted for the deaths . the chechnya-based human rights activist was kidnapped outside her home there in july 2009 and found dead in the neighboring russian republic of ingushetia later the same day . her body was riddled with bullets , russian prosecutors said -- several shots to the abdomen , and one to the head . estemirova had spent years investigating human rights abuses in chechnya . she told cnn in 2007 that she was investigating dozens of abductions and murders that had become the norm in chechnya , where security forces were fighting a dirty war against separatist rebels . the head of the group estemirova worked for , memorial , accuses the kremlin-backed chechen leadership of ordering her killing . her death drew the ire of european leaders . `` how many more natalya estemirovas and anna politkovskayas must be killed before the russian authorities protect people who stand up for the human rights of russian citizens ? '' terry davis , then the council of europe secretary general , said at the time . the guardian reported shortly after estemirova 's death that chechen president ramzan kadyrov and his aides had threatened her . kadyrov denied involvement in her killing , calling it a `` monstrous crime '' that was carried out to discredit his government . the powerful russian businessman 's falling-out with his government left him self-exiled in england . berezovsky accused the kremlin of killing litvinenko . and for years , he bankrolled the effort of litvinenko 's widow to push for an inquest into her husband 's death . in 2013 , he was found dead inside his house with a noose around his neck . was it a suicide ? the coroner 's office said it could not say . in 2013 , during a phone call to a television show , putin said he could not rule out that foreign secret services had a role in berezovsky 's death . however , he added that there is no evidence of this . a corruption-fighting lawyer , navalny famously branded putin 's united russia party `` the party of crooks and thieves . '' he has been a prominent organizer of mass street protests and has attacked corruption in russian government , using his blog and social media . the kremlin critic was arrested in december just after hours after he was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial . navalny was detained after he broke house arrest and went to join a protest against the court 's verdict . in court , he got a three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for the fraud conviction , while his brother , oleg , also convicted of fraud , was given a prison term of the same length . the brothers denied charges of embezzling 30 million rubles -lrb- $ 540,000 -rrb- from a russian subsidiary of french cosmetics company yves rocher between 2008 and 2012 . before the december ruling , he was under house arrest after he was convicted in 2013 of misappropriating $ 500,000 worth of state-owned timber , in what he told cnn was a fabricated case . the telegraph reported that the kremlin denies fabricating the case . a spokesman for putin said the president only learned of the sentence from the media . nemtsov , 55 , was a top official with the republican party of russia/party of people 's freedom , a liberal opposition group . he had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government . the most recent arrests were in 2011 , when he protested the results of parliamentary elections , and in 2012 , when tens of thousands protested against putin . most recently , he had been critical of the kremlin 's handling of the ukraine crisis . after his death friday night , opposition leader ilya yashin said his friend had been working on a report about russian troops and their involvement in ukraine . in an interview with newsweek magazine just hours before his death , nemtsov said russia was `` drowning '' under putin 's leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state . `` due to the policy of vladimir putin , a country with unparalleled potential is sinking , an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing , '' he said . the former deputy prime minister accused putin of using `` goebbels-style propaganda '' -- a reference to joseph goebbels , nazi germany 's propaganda minister -- to brainwash his countrymen . nemtsov was scheduled to lead an opposition rally in moscow last sunday . but two days before the event , he was shot dead as he walked home from dinner with his ukrainian model girlfriend . the killing took place just meters away from the kremlin . the kremlin suggested nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of russia intent on creating political discord . but many nemtsov supporters suspect putin 's administration of involvement . cnn 's matthew chance , ivan watson , alla eshchenko , laura smith-spark , holly yan and richard allen greene contributed to this report .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a new york man says his smartphone blew up in his pocket and that he wound up in a hospital . erik johnson of lindenhurst says his iphone 5c spontaneously erupted in extreme heat while it was in his pants pocket , giving him second - and third-degree burnson his leg the size of a football . he was headed to a wake for his cousin in new jersey on february 14 , johnson said , and he dropped his car keys . `` when i went to bend over , i heard a pop , '' he told cnn . `` i heard a sizzling , and i ended up ripping my pants off to stop it from burning me . '' johnson said he did n't know what was causing the pain at first and there was no warning -- just an extreme burn and a lot of pain . in a panic , he quickly started ripping at his pants as the phone began to melt the edges of his pocket shut , he said . `` i was trying to get it out of my pocket , '' he said . `` it started burning right through my pants . it was burning my leg , and i had to get my pants off somehow . '' johnson 's brother , who was with him at the time , decided driving him to the hospital would be faster than dialing 911 , johnson said . they drove to the bayonne medical center in new jersey . after being evaluated in the emergency room , johnson was taken by ambulance to the burn center at staten island university hospital . the burn center confirmed to cnn that he spent 10 days there receiving treatment . `` i still ca n't believe it , '' johnson said . `` i 've never dealt with anything like this before . '' he works as an operating engineer in new york city , maintaining escalators , cranes and forklifts . he said now he is at home with family in lindenhurst , and a nurse comes in every day to change his bandage . in the meantime , he said , he has n't even thought about buying a new phone . mike della , a personal injury lawyer on long island who is representing johnson , says despite two phone calls and a letter , apple had not yet responded to his queries about why his client 's phone suddenly exploded in heat . cnn reached out to apple , and the company stated that it is looking into the incident . johnson purchased the phone last year and had not been using a battery case or third-party charger , della said . `` first and foremost , we have to find out how this happened and prevent it from happening ever again , '' della told cnn . `` that 's the whole goal here . is the product safe ? '' della said because of this case , he now is quick to take extra precautions with his phone . `` now , every single time i have my iphone , instead of putting it in my pocket , i put it in the seat next to me because of this case , '' he said . `` my wife does the same thing , and so does everyone else at the -lrb- law -rrb- firm . it 's a little scary .

dili , east timor -lrb- cnn -rrb- stacey addison , who says she was detained for months in east timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine , is headed home . addison boarded a plane tuesday on the first leg of her journey back to oregon . `` i am thrilled to report that dr. stacey addison has gotten her passport back , and is now on a plane returning home here to oregon , '' sen. jeff merkley -lrb- d-oregon -rrb- said . `` this is terrific news for stacey , for her family , and for all the oregonians who have followed stacey 's story and helped support her from afar , '' merkley said in a statement . addison , 41 , was detained in september in the small southeast asian nation in a drug case in which she says she 's innocent . she was released in december but she still could n't leave because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned . former east timorese president and nobel peace prize laureate jose ramos-horta , hosted her temporarily at his home . addison 's arrest in september was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world . she said she had been traveling solo since january 2013 , having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe . on september 5 , she was sharing a cab from near the indonesian border to the east timor capital of dili . on the way , a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a dhl office , her mother , bernadette kero of oregon , has told cnn . after the man picked up the package , police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants , according to kero . the package was found to contain methamphetamine , addison has said . she initially was held for four nights , and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he did n't know her , kero said . in late october , during a court appearance where she thought she 'd retrieve her passport , a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to gleno prison outside dili . paul remedios , a lawyer representing addison , said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest , and that the reason for the warrant was unclear . kero told cnn in november that the case was a `` nightmare .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the basketball court , karl turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane . he 'll get so caught up in the moment that he 'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying . he 's in the zone . now , the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs . turk is the head basketball coach at west oso high school in corpus christi , texas . his team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the texas state basketball playoffs . it 's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players . `` coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams , '' says 14-year-old starter creighton avery , who has known turk since he was 9 . turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in indiana . when he was 5 years old , he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather . by the time he was 13 , he was dreaming of playing for the indiana pacers . all that changed on january 21 , 1994 . that night , the 14-year-old watched the chicago bulls beat his pacers in an intense game . he walked to bed . he woke up paralyzed . he was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital . for two weeks , he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight . after numerous tests , turk was diagnosed with transverse myelitis , a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord . turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like . he had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again . `` most patients do not recover well , '' said turk . he spent the next 66 days in the hospital . a turning point came when reggie miller , the indiana pacers ' all-star player and turk 's favorite basketballer , heard about what turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital . miller and turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories . the basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces , similar to the ones turk was wearing at the time . he talked about what it took to be in the nba : that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at , and personality and character weeded many good players out . `` reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who i was , '' turk said . `` for that moment , i felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness . '' it 's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams . there was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance . turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane , which he continues to walk with today . `` i keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where i have come from , '' said turk . turk attended indiana state university , where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach . in 2004 , he met coach ronnie arrow , the head basketball coach at texas a&m university-corpus christi , at a summer basketball camp and later worked for arrow as the school 's director of basketball operations . `` when you first see him , you may think he ca n't do what others can , '' arrow , now retired , told cnn . `` but he gets the job done no matter what . '' all turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team . but it was n't so easy . from 2009 to 2010 , he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions . he only received one interview . the forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching . `` i knew my resume was competitive , '' he said . `` i knew my passion for the game was n't exceeded by anyone . '' he began to wonder if `` having a cane and an unusual gait '' would prevent him from ever coaching . in the two years when he did n't have a team to coach , he studied other coaches ' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve . in 2010 , he was hired as assistant coach at west oso . and in 2014 , almost 10 years after moving to corpus christi , he became the head coach . he has strived to embody the ideals that reggie miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital . `` i want my students to know that i care about them , that i work for and belong to them , '' said turk . `` so often , it 's the messenger more than the message , i want to be the messenger that my students embrace . '' in his dreams , he can still play basketball . in reality , he has fallen down in practice , and during games . there is n't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down , and he often trips over his athletes ' feet . `` it hurts me that there are things that i can not physically demonstrate -- a lot of the footwork stuff with stops , turns and jumps . '' but his players do n't seem to mind . `` we do n't notice his disability , we see him as a great coach , '' said starter creighton avery . `` he is always positive and inspires us . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as the world digests the shock of russian opposition leader boris nemtsov 's brutal murder in front of the kremlin on friday , everybody is trying to determine who was behind it . the russian authorities were quick to throw out a number of theories , which ranged from the cia to ukraine , and even to nemtsov 's relationship troubles . while most people have discounted these out of hand , there are a surprising number of people who have bought into the statement , released by vladimir putin 's spokesman , that `` boris nemtsov was only slightly more than an average statistical citizen '' -- implying that the russian president would have no reason to want him dead . first of all , that is not true . nemtsov may not have been a significant threat two years ago when oil prices were high and russians were feeling politically apathetic -- but with oil prices down 50 % , the ruble down 50 % , the economy shrinking and companies firing people , a charismatic opposition politician like nemtsov is a real and direct threat to putin , who is terrified of experiencing a ukraine-style revolution in russia , especially when there is an unpredictable economic crisis brewing . nemtsov 's corruption exposés laid out , in damning detail , the truth behind the personal wealth of putin and his cronies ; one does n't need to be an expert to see the similarities with former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych , who fled kiev following popular uprisings in february of last year . nemtsov was also preparing a paper documenting the experiences of russian soldiers in ukraine -- one that could have dealt a catastrophic blow to the russian propaganda machine about the ukrainian conflict . and he was instrumental in organizing the march 1 anti-war rally in moscow -- a protest march he would have led , had he not been gunned down just hours before . the benefit of this murder to putin was n't just that it eliminated one opponent of the president , but that it will terrorize an entire class of dissidents . read more : other critics of putin who ended up dead . putin has a history of viciously attacking the most important person in any given group of enemies , in order to send a message to the rest of them . in 2003 , he did this by arresting and imprisoning the richest oligarch in the country , mikhail khodorkovsky . when khodorkovsky was put on trial in 2004 , putin allowed the television cameras film the wealthiest man in the country sitting in a cage . imagine that you were the 17th richest man in russia , and you saw a man more successful and influential than you sitting in a courtroom cage . what would you do ? anything you could to avoid meeting the same fate ; in the case of russia 's oligarchs , they all fell into line and were never a problem for the president again . the same thing happened with the murder of investigative journalist and vocal putin critic anna politkovskaya in 2006 . although kremlin involvement in her killing was never proved , the number of brave , outspoken investigative journalists in russia dropped to only a handful after her death . now , in 2015 , one of the most vocal opposition leaders has been gunned down directly in front of the kremlin . in addition to the political benefits of nemtsov 's demise , his killing also sends a clear and chilling message to anyone else who is similarly outspoken against putin : it does n't matter how well known you are , how many heads of state in the west know you , or how many people would be outraged by your death . if you cause problems , you can and will be killed . not only does this have a powerful effect on other opposition leaders , but it puts a primordial fear into the minds of average russian citizens , who may now think twice before taking to the streets to protest corruption , the war in ukraine , or the poor standards of living . no matter your agenda , is it worth your life ? the west needs to act urgently , with actions , not words . this is the most brazen high-profile assassination of a political opposition leader in modern russian history . so what can be done ? firstly , create , without any delay , an independent international inquiry into nemtsov 's assassination . no investigation conducted solely by the russian government would be credible under the circumstances , because it can not impartially examine the possible complicity of putin or the russian secret service in this act . there are statutory instruments in place for this kind of investigation , using the osce , the council of europe , and the united nations . secondly , boris nemtsov was a passionate supporter of `` magnitsky sanctions , '' visa bans and asset freezes targeted specifically at kleptocrats and human rights abusers . it would befit his legacy if european governments would finally impose these sanctions , and stop accepting the billions of dollars which beneficiaries of the corrupt putin regime are able to keep safely in western banks . these sanctions will also act as a real consequence if the russian government refuses to cooperate with an independent inquiry into nemtsov 's murder . the only reason that someone was bold enough to kill boris nemtsov was because a string of previous murders were met with words of condemnation , but no real action from the west . yushenkov , politkovskaya , shchekochikhin , klebnikhov , estemirova , markelov , magnitsky and now nemtsov . how many others need to die before real action is taken ? this is a watershed moment , not just for russia , but for the west . we have a responsibility to the future nemtsovs of this world to make sure that these assassinations will no longer go unpunished .
yaounde , cameroon -lrb- cnn -rrb- cameroon 's security forces are predicting a drawn-out battle with boko haram as evidence filters out that the insurgents are now recruiting there . `` we do n't doubt that boko haram is recruiting in cameroon , '' said col. joseph nouma , commander of operation alpha , a special military operation set up by cameroon 's government to fight the nigerian terrorist group . he says communities bordering nigeria have been emptied of men between the ages of 10 and 45 . `` many of them are found across the border in nigeria , training with the terrorists , '' he told cnn . this has made it difficult for the country 's defense forces to adequately estimate the power of the terrorist group . nouma said the number of militants may be greater than is widely believed , though there is no reliable estimate of the group 's strength . `` boko haram is a permanent metamorphosis , dying every day but recruiting every day as well , '' says col. jacob kodji , interim commander of the 4th military region . `` and this complicates a lot of things for us . '' nouma agreed : `` we kill them , but they keep on coming . '' boko haram is a nigerian-based islamic group whose purpose is to institute sharia , or islamic law . they have carried out a campaign of terror in northern nigeria , killing thousands , taking hundreds captive , and occupying swaths of territory in borno state . as many as 200,000 nigerians have fled to neighboring countries , creating an urgent humanitarian situation , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees reported last month . for the past two years , boko haram fighters have been carrying out cross-border raids on cameroon , slaughtering hundreds and torching entire neighborhoods . but as the country 's defense forces -- later joined by battle-hardened chadian troops -- turned up the momentum against the insurgents , the terrorists began to swell their ranks with cameroonians . nouma said he believes `` most of the worst attacks we have suffered '' were carried out by cameroonians fighting for boko haram . also , the militants ' ability to hit several different places at once , and with precision , suggests that `` there are people over here giving them information , '' nouma said . in january , boko haram struck fotokol , a cameroonian town separated by only a bridge from gambarou , nigeria , a stronghold of the islamist extremists . the attackers killed more than 400 people . cameroonian and chadian soldiers stationed there managed to kill 150 invaders . among them was the son of ahmadou moustafa , a fotokol resident . for two months , moustafa did n't know the whereabouts of his son , akim , or what he was doing . he did n't find out until the aftermath of the fighting , when locals removed the veil on one of the dead attackers to reveal his 15-year-old boy 's face . `` i was really shocked and embarrassed at the development , '' moustafa said . while it 's difficult to fathom the appeal of extreme , violent doctrine among young cameroonians , ambient poverty and chronic unemployment in the far north region may explain why some there are lured to boko haram pay . the government 's 2010 national population and housing census found the region to be the country 's poorest , with 60 % of the population living in poverty . joseph mbah ndam , an opposition member of cameroon 's parliament , told cnn that the government of president paul biya `` has for over 30 years now failed to create jobs for the youths . and in such circumstances , they may be easily manipulated into joining such hate groups . '' a senior government official from the region , who would not be named , agreed , saying that `` in a context of such extreme poverty , it could n't be otherwise . '' `` no significant economic project has been carried out there ... the far north is the most populated in the country , but has been completely abandoned , '' the official explained . `` so it 's not surprising that youths should be sensitive to calls by boko haram . '' desperate youths are n't the only recruits , however . very often , police are bribed into collaborating . in january , abdoulaye farikou , senior inspector of police in balaza , was arrested by the military and accused of using his position as head of the identification unit in the far north region town to issue cameroonian id cards to militants coming in from nigeria . security officials say such a move makes it easy for boko haram to infiltrate cameroon and gather vital security information . along with the presence of some 6,000 cameroonian troops and plans to deploy some 20,000 more over the next two years , the government now has come up with a $ 135 million program to finance 94 development projects . part of the money will be used to increase cereal production by 30 % in the far north region , where child malnutrition now stands at some 70 % , according to economy minister emmanuel nganou djoumessi . other investments will be made in road construction , railway development , mining and social services . `` we ca n't easily win this war with military means alone , '' said mijiyawa bakary , the regional governor . `` the development package government has put in place will definitely keep many young people busy , and therefore will not be charmed by the false promises of the terrorist group . '' but development projects can only be carried out in a climate of peace , and officials here hope that the multinational joint task force -- about 8,500 troops from cameroon , chad , niger , nigeria and benin -- will defeat boko haram and lay that groundwork .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- anna duritskaya , the ukrainian model who was with opposition politician boris nemtsov when he was shot in moscow , is now the focus of intense interest . a beautiful brunette more than 30 years his junior , she had been his girlfriend for 2 1/2 years . so what is known about her ? the 23-year-old had been out for dinner with nemtsov on friday night . she had suggested getting a taxi , but nemtsov did n't want to , preferring to walk , duritskaya 's mother said . as the pair crossed a bridge in central moscow , the 55-year-old kremlin critic was gunned down by unknown attackers . his girlfriend was holding his hand and heard what sounded like a clapping sound , her mother , inna duritskaya , told cnn . nemtsov went limp and fell to the ground , fatally shot in the back . duritskaya is the only known witness to the shooting , which occurred 100 meters -lrb- 330 feet -rrb- from the kremlin but appears not to have been captured on security cameras . inna duritskaya said her daughter called her right after she called police to raise the alarm . `` she was crying and she was saying boris had been killed and he 's lying next to me , '' inna duritskaya said . `` she was in such shock she could n't say anything else . just , ` mum , boris is killed , and he 's lying next to me . ' '' on monday , the russian television station dozhd published an interview with anna duritskaya . she told the interviewer that she did not see who killed nemtsov , but that when she turned around , she saw a light-colored car driving away . in an interview with cnn , ilya yashin , a political ally and friend of nemtsov 's , said that duritskaya had telephoned him immediately after the shooting and said there were several men in the car containing the shooter . over the weekend , russian authorities questioned duritskaya about what she saw . while in moscow , the model was staying at the apartment of an nemtsov aide under constant police guard . but moscow 's investigative committee insisted that she was not detained and could have left at any time . `` she said she wanted to give the testimony and took part in investigative activities understanding the importance of it for the investigation , '' a statement released tuesday said . `` we received no complaints from anna duritskaya or her lawyer during her stay in moscow . only today , after investigative activities are over she left russia . '' the model left the russian capital monday night bound for kiev , ukraine , said yevhen perebyinis , a spokesman for ukraine 's foreign ministry . inna duritskaya told cnn that while being questioned , her daughter faced constant psychological pressure from moscow authorities and that she fears she will be implicated in his death . in a skype interview with dozhd , anna duritskaya indicated her continued presence in moscow after the shooting was not from choice -- and seemed to appeal to be allowed to leave . `` now i have a status of a witness , i gave all evidence possible , i do n't understand why i 'm still on the territory of russia . i want to go to my mother who is ill , who is in very difficult psychological condition , '' she said . `` during three days , they have been taking me together with security in police cars to the investigation committee and conduct the investigation . they are not explaining when they are going to release me and the reason they are keeping me here . '' perhaps not . according to the investigative committee , duritskaya signed a witness protocol and confidentiality agreement , which is standard procedure in russia . it states that she will not share information she gave to investigators or any preliminary findings of the investigation , the committee said . `` leaving russia , duritskaya expressed a wish to continue to cooperate with the investigation and to participate in any ongoing investigation if needed , '' it added . inna duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader . `` of course when i heard she was dating him , it was a bit of a shock , '' she said . `` then when i met him in person , i liked him a lot as a person . he was straightforward , he treated my daughter very well , she was happy . and i could n't influence it anyway ; my daughter did what she wanted to . of course , i was worried and scared , but i could n't change it anyway .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- there 's a $ 30,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a bank robbery trio known as the black hat bandits , suspected in a two-month string of robberies across maryland and virginia , the latest coming monday . they 've earned their name for the black hats they wear during their heists , and the feds say they 're becoming increasingly dangerous . `` in an escalation of violence , the black hat bandits have become more brazen at each robbery having threatened bank customers and tellers , most recently holding a gun to a customer 's head , and jumping teller counters in attempts to gain access to bank vaults , '' according to an fbi wanted poster . an fbi statement last month provided more details : `` during each robbery the black hat bandits have been described as carrying handguns and wearing winter coats , sunglasses , black hats -lrb- either a winter knit cap or wide brimmed hat -rrb- and facial disguises such as ski masks or a fake beard . '' the bandits pulled off their most recent robbery monday during lunch hour at a wells fargo bank in falls church , virginia . it marked the crew 's eighth bank robbery this year . `` we now confirm that this is a three-person crew : two who take over the bank and one who waits in the car , '' an fbi spokesperson told cnn affiliate wjla . no one was injured in the holdup , which unfolded after two black-clad men -- one african-american , one white -- entered the bank with firearms , robbed the bank and fled in a vehicle waiting outside , police told the station . hours after the robbery , investigators were at the scene gathering evidence , which included a footprint in the snow , wjla reported . it was the second falls church bank robbery in recent weeks , but the february 21 robbery of an apple federal credit union two blocks from monday 's crime scene was the work of a lone gunman , not the black hat bandits , authorities told wjla . the robbers who committed monday 's robbery are described as in their 40s and between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall , according to the fbi . other banks which the black hat bandits are suspected of robbing include a bank of america in mclean , virginia , on january 2 ; a bb&t in fairfax , virginia , on january 16 ; a bank of america in vienna , virginia , on january 20 ; an essex bank in arnold , maryland , on january 30 ; and a suntrust bank in waldorf , maryland , on february 5 . in one of their more audacious undertakings , the robbers hit two banks on february 18 . first , they hit a bb&t in vienna , virginia , before traveling to a wells fargo in sterling , virginia , 40 minutes later . `` one of the suspects put his gun to a customer 's head while demanding everyone to ` get down , ' and demanded money from a victim teller . in both robberies the subjects fled the banks with an undisclosed amount of money , '' the fbi said in a statement . the fbi is asking anyone with information on the bank robberies in virginia to call 202-278-2000 . those with information on the maryland heists should call 410-265-8080 . the public can also submit anonymous tips at https://tips.fbi.gov .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the family of ibragim todashev , an associate of tamerlan tsarnaev who was killed during an fbi interrogation , plans to sue the agency . todashev 's parents filed a `` notice of claim '' monday , saying they plan to seek $ 30 million in a wrongful death lawsuit . the claim argues the fbi has given `` no viable justification '' to account for shooting and killing todashev during a 2013 interrogation in todashev 's apartment in orlando , florida . the interrogation occurred about a month after the boston marathon bombings and centered around another crime linked to bombing suspect tsarnaev : a 2011 triple homicide in waltham , massachusetts . todashev admitted to his direct role in slashing three people 's throats in waltham and said tsarnaev was involved as well , a federal law enforcement official told cnn in 2013 . it was during that interview that todashev was shot dead . the council on american islamic relations florida filed the notice of the todashev family 's intention to sue on monday . `` we are seeking answers and justice for someone who was shot seven times by an fbi agent in his own home after hours of interrogation , '' said ali kurnaz , a spokesman for the civil rights group . many things that happened that day do n't add up , kurnaz said . `` todashev was unarmed with any gun , knife , explosive or other deadly weapon , '' the notice says . `` todashev did not pose a threat of serious bodily harm . '' the fbi did not immediately respond to a request for comment . officials who spoke to cnn after the shooting painted a different picture of what happened during the interrogation . one law enforcement official said todashev attacked the fbi agent with a broom handle , gashing his head before the agent opened fire . at the time , the official stressed that the shooting was justified and done in self-defense because the agent felt threatened . a u.s. government official briefed on the investigation rebuffed the idea that todashev was n't a threat -- noting , for instance , that he could have taken the agent 's gun . `` he was armed . maybe it was n't a weapon , but he had a long object , '' the official said . and because of todashev 's martial arts expertise , `` he was a weapon himself . '' but from the outset , that argument did n't add up to the todashev family . `` my son was definitely unarmed , because he never had a gun , '' father abdulbaki todashev told cnn in 2013 . `` he could n't attack them or fight them ; he could n't do anything because even two men could easily handle him . '' the elder todashev suggested his son may have been provoked . `` if you question someone for eight hours , you can provoke him into anything , '' he said . last year , florida state attorney jeffrey ashton said after an investigation the fbi agent 's actions were justified . '' -lrb- todashev -rrb- went down , but he was not incapacitated . he came up again in an aggressive manner , and the officer then fired the second volley of three or four shots . which at that point essentially incapacitated mr. todashev , '' ashton said . `` it would seem almost superhuman , but everything that we have learned in the investigation would show an individual who has a great deal of tolerance of pain and would more or less fight beyond it . `` it seemed to me that if the goal was to get away , he could have gone out that back door and gotten away instead of going towards the officers .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- workers digging underneath a paris supermarket have made an unsettling discovery : as many as 200 skeletons . the grocery store , monoprix , was doing some renovations in january and workers removing an underground wall discovered the bones . the area was apparently part of a cemetery for the hospital of the trinity , according to cnn affiliate , france 's bfm-tv . the cemetery operated from the 12th century to around the 17th century . researchers and archeologists are conducting carbon dating and dna testing to try to figure out when and why the people died , the affiliate said . it 's clear they all died around the same time , lead archeologist isabelle abadie told bfm-tv , because of the way the bodies were neatly arranged . `` what 's surprising is the bodies were not thrown in -lrb- the graves -rrb- but were carefully placed there in an organized manner . the individuals , men , women , and children , were placed head-to-toe , '' to fit as many as possible in the grave , abadie explained . paris suffered several plague epidemics during the times that the hospital was in operation , as well as a smallpox outbreak in the 17th century . archeologists working the site have found eight common graves in an area that is 100 square meters , with seven of the graves containing between five and 20 skeletons each and another site with more than 150 skeletons , bfm-tv said . the groupings suggest that whole families were buried together . abadie told bfm-tv that when the cemetery was shut down centuries ago , most of the remains were moved to the catacombs of paris . `` but apparently the job was not done well , '' she said . cnn 's alanne orjoux contributed to this report .
los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- america 's skid row sits in downtown los angeles . this pocket of 2,000 men and women constitutes the nation 's biggest concentration of homeless people living and sleeping on public sidewalks , in scattered camps under tarps . not surprisingly , sanitary conditions are appalling . this quarter of despair is now at the center of national attention for another reason : this week , los angeles police and a homeless man in a tent engaged in a confrontation , ending with officers fatally shooting the man known only as `` africa , '' an apparent reference to his home continent . it was all captured on video by bystanders . police allege `` africa '' tried to reach for an officer 's gun , prompting the police gunfire against him . `` skid row is a 54-block area that has the largest homeless number of individuals in the country , '' said jerry jones , executive director of the national coalition for the homeless . he 's based in new york city . `` new york city has the largest homeless population , but los angeles has the highest unsheltered population in the country , which has led to the destitution you see today , '' he added . new york city 's unique right-to-shelter mandate ensures `` temporary emergency shelter to every man , woman , and child who is eligible for services , every night , '' the city 's website says . but not in los angeles , where two-thirds of the county 's 40,000 homeless people are unsheltered , jones said . so many live on the streets of downtown los angeles -- and elsewhere . in some american minds , los angeles may conjure up images of a great american city cursed with an abandoned urban core . that 's an old memory . today , downtown los angeles enjoys a renaissance , right down to the new hotels and mall surrounding the staples center , where professional basketball and hockey are played , often to championships . but not on skid row . -lrb- that 's its official designation . even google maps label it so . -rrb- . there are few champion moments here . the only exception may be the everyday heroes who labor in 107 charities and agencies feeding and comforting the lost souls bivouacked on the street . the triple-digit number of social service agencies , however , is often cited as one reason that los angeles endures as the nation 's skid row capital : there 's a $ 54-million-a-year charitable infrastructure anchored to the poverty district . nobody seems to be going anywhere . that does n't deter ryan navales , manager of government and public affairs for the midnight mission , which strives to lift people out of poverty . his work and those of his peers is like that of sisyphus to the rock , the mythic figure whose endless labor was to push a rock to the top of a mountain and then have to do it all over again after the rock rolled downhill . `` skid row has become less transient , '' navales said . `` the history of skid row goes back to a transient neighborhood associated with the railroad . the true definition of transient is short term . now it 's long term . it 's become a neighborhood . '' the century-old midnight mission now serves 3,000 meals daily to the homeless , navales said . navales cites a shortage of affordable housing as a reason for how `` there 's no place for people to go . '' he asserts his agencies and others offers hope to those who feel hopeless . navales knows from personal experience . he once worked for microsoft as a network administrator in the 1990s , but he lost it all , including his family . drug addiction obliterated his life . `` after destroying my family , in and out of jail , in and out of treatment , i was living on the streets and doing what people have to do on the streets to support a really gnarly heroin habit , '' navales said . `` in august of 2011 , i was brought to the midnight mission homeless , '' he added . `` i had a backpack on . '' he now wears a suit , on skid row 's front line , trying to relieve and unravel the nation 's gordian knot of poverty . cnn 's paul vercammen contributed to this report .
mcallen , texas -lrb- cnn -rrb- for residents of this town just across the bridge from mexico , it 's hard to understand how a washington political fight could end up threatening the livelihood of people charged with securing the border . `` what incentive do they have to keep protecting us if they 're not getting paid ? '' asked cecilia de la cruz as she sat at a coffee shop with a friend . `` it is troubling . '' the latest example of congressional dysfunction has real world implications here , where thousands of agents monitor the u.s. border with mexico . the agents , along with other employees vital to national security such as tsa screeners , will have to show up to work without being paid if congress misses a friday deadline to keep the department of homeland security funded . thousands of other agency workers will be furloughed . the employees are caught up in a fight over immigration policy . republicans want to tie funding for the department to legislation that would roll back president barack obama 's immigration executive orders -- a nonstarter for democrats . the battle reached a fevered pitch last week when congress narrowly missed a deadline to avoid a partial dhs shutdown , giving themselves an extension until march 6 to broker a deal . speaker john boehner could try to avert another showdown by holding a vote as early as tuesday on a dhs bill that does n't touch obama 's immigration order . but the political intrigue is n't registering for some residents here . angelea remorin , a nurse who works nights at a hospital , said she was n't concerned yet because she had n't read or heard anything about the potential shutdown . `` me , personally , i peek into the news every now and then , but it 's things like isis , you know , those big headline things , that i look at on the news , '' she said . `` none of my friends have been talking about -lrb- the shutdown -rrb- , and i have n't been keeping up with it . '' at the coffee shop with de la cruz , ronaldo delacruz said he 'd heard of the potential shutdown but did n't feel unsafe . `` i do n't know what 's going to necessarily happen to the department itself , '' delacruz said . `` i do n't know how that 's going to affect the protection of the border or border patrol , but i guess we 're going to find out . '' marco solis said he was mad after hearing that congress agreed to keep dhs running for only a few days . he said he wonders why lawmakers do n't realize how their decisions affect local areas . `` they 're a bunch of incompetent men who just ca n't figure it out , '' he said . `` and i know not all of them are men , but say predominantly , old white men screwing up this country . '' local employees of the department of homeland security stationed along the border said they were n't allowed to speak to newsgroups on the record because of orders directly from washington . but speaking without attribution , they did express frustration with congress for defunding their department in 2013 as part of the broader government shutdown and possibly again later this week if a longer term funding bill is n't passed . the agents argued they have families to feed and mortgages to pay , just like anyone else . chris cabrera , the vice president of the local 3307 national border patrol council , a union for border agents , echoed those sentiments . he said that in the mcallen area , about 2,000 agents would be affected by this funding bill . he said the problem is in washington , where congress wo n't feel the direct effect of a possible funding gap . as a border patrol agent for 13 years who also felt the effect of the 2013 shutdown , he remembers how it went down last time . `` it 's pretty much out of our hands '' he said . `` the sad part is that we 're the football in this political game , and we 're just caught in the middle getting tossed around while somebody is trying to push their own agenda , one way or the other . '' in the meantime , he said he 's working with local agents to help them send letters to their mortgage companies to alert them of the possible problems because most of them are considered essential personnel and will have to continue working without a paycheck . for now , he said that 's all that the union can do to help . `` at some point , people will jump ship , '' he said . `` i do n't think there 's going to be a rush for the door , but we will have some people that are gon na say ` enough is enough . this is twice in two years , and i 'm done with this . ' '' if a shutdown were to happen later this week , cabrera said that nonessential personnel , such as administration positions in the department , would not report to work . agents would continue to work securing the border , but depending on how long the shutdown lasts , they 'd eventually have to work in some of the administrative positions as well to make up for employees who were furloughed . `` most likely what will happen is that they 'll have to pull agents who do frontline work , processing work , or stuff in the station , '' he said . `` they 're going to have to backfill them -- you know somebody has to answer the phones at the front of the building . '' he added that he believes the cartels in mexico are keeping up with american news so that they can take advantage in case dhs does shut down . `` they know , '' cabrera said about anyone across the border hoping to bring people or drugs . `` they scout us when our shift changes . they know everything that 's coming along . and when they see stuff like this , when it hits the media , they start mobilizing . '' mcallen mayor jim darling agreed and said he believes cartels and gangs are more tuned in about what 's going on in washington than his own constituents . `` i would think there 's gulf cartel guys listening to washington right now , '' he said . `` if they think there 's a porous border , they 're going to come and make some money . '' darling says that washington 's actions have a `` ripple effect '' across the country , of which they should be more aware and considerate . `` i do n't know about you , but i seriously doubt a congressman can go without a paycheck , '' he said . `` it 's a bipartisan problem , and they have to come up with a bipartisan solution , and they 're not . ''

-lrb- cnn -rrb- al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has freed a saudi diplomat it kidnapped three years ago , yemeni foreign ministry officials told cnn . tribal leaders involved in negotiations with al qaeda over the last month handed abdullah al khalidi to saudi authorities on monday , two yemeni government officials said . unknown gunmen kidnapped al khalidi , the saudi deputy consular , in 2012 as he was leaving his residence in the mansoora district of yemen 's business capital of aden . he was later handed over to al qaeda , where he appeared in al qaeda video last year pleading to the saudi government to ensure his safe release . al qaeda was demanding a ransom for his release and threatened to kill him if the ransom was not paid . cnn was not able to confirm whether saudi arabia or his family paid a ransom in exchange for his release . a yemeni foreign ministry official told cnn that his government was not involved in the negotiations for al khalidi 's release . `` the yemeni government does not negotiate with terrorists . ransoms that are paid to terrorists motivates them to conduct more kidnappings , '' said the official on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media . the saudi interior ministry announced monday that al khalidi reached riyadh safely and is undergoing medical checkups . al khalidi had been living in aden for four years when he was kidnapped . last week , a frenchwoman working for an international organization was kidnapped , along with her yemeni translator , in sanaa . two four-wheel drive vehicles were used in the kidnapping attempt , according to eyewitnesses . their whereabouts remain unknown . kidnappings of foreigners is common in yemen with tribes or al qaeda-linked militants often demanding a ransom for their release or using them as a bargaining chip in their dealings with the central government . al qaeda is believed to have been behind most of the kidnappings since 2012 . gunmen kidnapped an iranian diplomat , ahmed bakht , in yemen in 2013 , and his whereabouts are still unknown . bakht was an iranian national employed within the iranian embassy in yemen and was kidnapped while traveling through the diplomatic quarter in sanaa when gunmen blocked the road ahead of him and abducted him .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as expected , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu gave a rousing speech to congress , rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references . yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . as national security adviser susan rice told the pro-israel lobbying group aipac on monday , `` precisely because this is such a serious issue , we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one . sound bites wo n't stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon . '' the obama administration , on the other hand , is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block iran 's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a bomb from today 's estimated three months to at least a year . without a deal , iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium , while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track iran 's activities . at the top of the list of questions the prime minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of `` no deal '' would actually make israel safer ? as rice said : `` here 's what 's likely to happen without a deal . iran will install and operate advanced centrifuges . iran will seek to fuel its -lrb- plutonium -rrb- reactor in arak . iran will rebuild its uranium stockpile . and , we 'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today . '' if no deal that the united states and five other powers actually might strike with the iranians would be acceptable to netanyahu , how does he propose to deal with the iranian nuclear threat ? he spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against iran and keeping them in place until iran ceased regional aggression , sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate israel . but years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the iranians to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward . neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of iranian scientists . and if the united states was seen as walking away from a possible agreement , the international sanctions regime would likely crumble , not strengthen . iranian hard-liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver 's seat in tehran , while those would want to see iran rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined . it is doubtful that netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the iranian nuclear program . that leaves one other option -- military force . of course , israel could order a military strike on iran any time it chooses , but israel 's ability to inflict significant damage on iran 's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited . when the discussion turns to military action , what is really meant is u.s. military action . it is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the u.s. congress would shy away from openly asking washington to attack another country , especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of iraq , which netanyahu also lobbied for . we should recall netanyahu 's september 2002 testimony to the house foreign affairs committee , six months before the u.s. assault on baghdad began , when he said : `` it 's not a question of whether iraq 's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out ; it 's not a question of whether you 'd like to see a regime change in iran but how to achieve it . '' netanyahu may have learned from that experience . he knows that the u.s. public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the middle east . that 's why he advocates policies that would put the united states on a path to military action without mentioning the words `` military action . '' this israeli leader , who faces a tough election back home in two weeks , has mastered the art of policy vagueness . he applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the palestinians last year , declaring he was in favor of a two-state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter . his biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the palestinians recognize israel as a jewish state . this is an israeli leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words . but words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that 's where netanyahu once again failed himself , his country and his audience .

london -lrb- cnn -rrb- in his teenage years , there was little to set mohammed emwazi -- a quiet , hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates . that 's according to joanna shuter , his former head teacher at quintin kynaston community academy in northwest london . now 26 , emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the isis militant nicknamed `` jihadi john '' who 's appeared in beheading videos of western hostages . but in his school days , it was a different matter . when he joined quintin kynaston at 14 or 15 , he was little trouble himself but was the focus of some bullying . `` he was bullied a little , but because he was quiet and he was reserved ... generally he was fine , '' shuter said . `` there were no massive behavior problems with him , and by the time he got into ... -lrb- his last years -rrb- he had settled , he was working hard , he achieved great grades for him , and he went to the university of his choice . '' he just did n't stand out as troubled , she said . `` if there had been any concerns about mohammed , they would have been picked up , and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done . '' born in kuwait , but brought up in london from the age of 6 , emwazi was one of the school 's many students from an immigrant background . the school 's intake is 70 % muslim , said shuter , with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of london . but its ethos was one of tolerance and integration , with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community . staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind , shuter said . they also reached out to the sometimes insular , conservative muslim communities that many of their students came from , she said , to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures . nonetheless , emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences , most likely outside of school or through social media . and he was not alone . at least two other students who attended quintin kynaston also allegedly later turned to islamist extremism . one , mohammed sakr , only overlapped at the school by a few months with shuter . he was reportedly killed in a u.s. drone strike in somalia in 2012 . `` he was very outgoing , jolly , sporty kind of person and fun , '' shuter said . shuter sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today . `` i think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control , '' she said . she still finds it hard to believe that emwazi could be the apparent killer with the london accent recorded on isis videos . `` my blood just ran cold , '' she said of when she first heard the news . `` when i hear the name , i just find it incredible to marry what i 've clearly seen on the tv with the person that i knew . it literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up . i ca n't believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him . `` i think it 's horrific , the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for -lrb- isis -rrb- . i just think it 's shocking . '' the london-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who 's watched the videos released by isis of the killing of western hostages . cage , a london-based advocacy group that worked with emwazi , has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the uk security services questioning him . they asked about his attitude toward the july 7 , 2005 , terror attacks in london and the 9/11 attacks on the united states , he says . `` we 're going to keep a close eye on you , mohammed , '' he alleges they told him . cage has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services . it says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help . but some analysts say the emails are only part of the story , arguing that investigators targeted emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- after postponing its first execution of a woman in 70 years because of `` cloudy '' lethal injection drugs , georgia has indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures , the state said tuesday . kelly renee gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. et monday , but for the second time in less than a week , it was called off . the state postponed the first planned execution because of `` weather and associated scheduling issues , '' department spokeswoman gwendolyn hogan said . `` prior to the execution , the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency . the drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits , '' the georgia department of corrections said in a statement . `` within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution , the execution team performed the necessary checks . at that time , the drugs appeared cloudy . the department of corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist , and in an abundance of caution , inmate gissendaner 's execution has been postponed . '' repeating the `` abundance of caution '' wording , the department issued a news release tuesday , saying , `` the scheduled executions of kelly renee gissendaner and brian keith terrell have been postponed while an analysis is conducted of the drugs planned for use in last night 's scheduled execution of inmate gissendaner . '' gissendaner , 47 , is condemned to die for a 1997 murder plot in which she conspired with boyfriend gregory owen to murder her husband . terrell was convicted in the shooting and beating death of a 70-year-old friend of his mother 's after the man called police to say terrell had stolen checks from him , according to the georgia attorney general 's office . gissendaner has already requested an extravagant last meal : two burger king whoppers with cheese -lrb- with everything -rrb- , two large orders of fries , popcorn , cornbread , a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes , bell peppers , onions , carrots , cheese , boiled eggs and newman 's own buttermilk dressing , the corrections department said . she also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert . terrell was scheduled to die between march 10 and 17 . last year , oklahoma issued a months-long moratorium on executions after murderer and rapist clayton lockett convulsed , writhed and lay alive on a gurney for 43 minutes before dying . it was the state 's first time using a new , three-drug cocktail for an execution . the constitutionality of lethal injection drugs has made headlines since 2013 , when european manufacturers -- including denmark-based lundbeck , which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned u.s. prisons from using their drugs in executions . thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- igniting a live man in a cage ; severing the heads of dozens ; kidnapping , raping and selling women and children -- isis ' shocking maltreatment of its captives has become regrettably predictable . but that has made their latest decision on the fate of 19 christian prisoners all the more surprising to some . on sunday , isis released them . ten other assyrian christians are expected to join them in freedom after a short time in captivity . all but one of the christians released were part of a group of 220 assyrians captured last week during offensives on northern syrian villages , said the london-based syrian observatory for human rights . in the shadow of its sadistic mercilessness , the sudden reversal leaves many asking : why ? the group has not explained its decision . here are some possible answers . it was not a militant commander but an isis sharia judge , said osama edward , who heads the assyrian human rights network , based in sweden . some of edward 's family members are among the captured christians . his rights group keeps contact with local people , via phone and internet , and has a field team in syria , he said . the sharia judge asked the christians if they were part of any militia , edward said . then he pronounced them not guilty of violating sharia law and ordered them released . the assyrian christians were all from the village of tal goran . they have returned home but are keeping quiet for now . can christianity survive in the middle east ? `` they were so tired , '' edward said . they had a closed meeting with a bishop , and then ate and went home . `` they were treated well , '' contacts in tal goran passed on to edward . `` nobody was tortured . '' not to graeme wood , who published a detailed analysis on isis ' religious inner workings this week in the atlantic . he was pleased to hear about it , but he felt it fit into isis ' plans . `` isis has claimed for a long time to follow rules , and it claims that these sharia courts will impose limits , '' he told cnn . `` they can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of sharia law . '' it 's possible . it did win them points with assyrian activists . `` it 's a good sign to show that ` we can talk , ' '' edward said . isis has taken heat even from other islamists who accuse it of rogue justice , especially against muslim civilians they 've condemned as `` infidels '' out of hand . it 's part of the reason al qaeda has rejected the group , wood wrote . that reduced some of isis ' chances of receiving international moral and financial support , leaving the terror group to make up the gap with other funding . and it has led to a violent split with another jihadi group in syria , the al-nusra front , according to the washington institute for near east policy . other islamist groups in syria have frowned on isis for not submitting to decisions from sharia courts . the main issue drawing anger from other islamist groups revolves around muslim civilians , who are isis ' most common victims . and the released captives are christians . but christian activist edward thinks the isis sharia court decision was , in part , a nod to syrian sunni muslim tribal leaders who negotiated for the christians ' release . first , the tribes care deeply about their christian neighbors and do n't want them killed , edward said . it also makes the sunni tribal leaders look good and gets a rapport started between them and isis . isis has a very narrow definition of who is a real muslim and who is an apostate . foremost , a muslim must practice sunni islam in its eyes . the group is quick to practice `` takfir , '' which amounts to the excommunication of a muslim , for things as seemingly petty as shaving off one 's beard or voting in an election . isis is quick to kill anyone it condemns , because it wants to create a fanatically pure caliphate with only the strictest devotees , wood wrote . isis has executed 125 of its own members for doing things that broke with its strict take on islam , the syrian observatory said . yes . even in the strictest interpretation of islam , there is a provision for sparing christians , wood wrote . social media posts indicate that isis carries out mass killings regularly , but `` exempted from automatic execution , it appears , are christians who do not resist their new government . '' they are required to pay a special tax and acknowledge the new ruling power . that 's exactly what the judge ruled , edward said . the released assyrian christians agreed to acknowledge isis as their new masters and to pay the tax . isis is still holding two of tal goran 's christian villagers , edward said . they should be released as soon as the taxes are paid . he is hoping for the same deal for the other christian villagers , including for his family . cnn 's samira said and dana ford contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- tunisia 's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security . only just recovering from the impact of the arab spring uprisings four years ago , tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers . but following wednesday 's attack and siege at the prestigious bardo museum in central tunis , the country 's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country . a significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack , which government officials said was the work of `` islamists . '' prime minister habib essid said polish , italian , german and spanish tourists are among those killed , with another 20 tourists plus two tunisians wounded in the attack . msc cruises said its ship , msc splendida , is currently docked in the tunis port of la goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city , including the bardo at the time of the attack . `` all the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended , '' msc said in a statement . another ship , the costa fascinosa , docked in tunis at that time , has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers , its parent company costa cruise said . as details of the incident emerged , several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks , around an area that includes the national parliament building . the u.s. embassy in tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in tunisia and the risk of kidnappings . its warning cautions against trips to tunisia 's central , southern and border regions . britain 's foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- also urged uk citizens to stay away from the affected areas of tunis and to `` follow the instructions of tunisian security authorities . '' its warning also carried longstanding advice : `` there is a high threat from terrorism , including kidnapping . attacks could be indiscriminate , including places visited by foreigners . '' with tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there , travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack . it 's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in kenya last year . thomson and first choice , a uk-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to tunisia , said it had canceled organized excursions to tunis as a precaution . a statement said it would follow fco advice , which overall remained unchanged for tunisia . `` thomson and first choice customers stay in beach destinations , not tunis , and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today , '' it said . `` as a precaution however we have canceled excursions to tunis for the coming days . `` customer safety is of paramount importance to us and we continue to work closely with the fco and the british consulate to monitor the situation . tunisia remains a popular destination for us and customers are enjoying their holidays as normal . '' in its advisory , the uk foreign office points out `` 424,707 british nationals visited tunisia in 2014 . most british tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free . '' indeed , tunisia 's largely unsullied reputation as a safe north african destination for europeans seeking low coast beach breaks has clawed back some of the popularity it enjoyed before 2011 . in 2010 , the country welcomed 6.9 million tourists to its beach resorts and numerous historic sites . in 2011 , the year in which an uprising ousted longtime president zine al-abidine ben ali -- an event credited with triggering the arab spring -- that number fell below 4.8 million . with calm restored in recent years -- despite security concerns from neighboring libya and ongoing political tensions -- those numbers have been on the rise , helped by costly advertising campaigns . recently reported statistics put visitor numbers still 10 % lower than their pre-2011 levels , but numbers had been expected to rise again -- particularly with a new `` star wars '' film renewing interest in the country 's role as a key location in the original movies . in a 2013 interview , tunisian tourism minister jamel gamra said up to 20 % of tunisia 's population -- equivalent to 2 million people -- relied on the tourism industry . he told the inter press service he was optimistic that visitor numbers would continue to grow . `` the sector has big potential and we aim to reach 10 million tourists by 2016 , a growth of one million tourists per year , '' he said . `` tunisia also has more freedom and democracy now , which is very important for economic growth and prosperity and has a positive effect on the tourism industry .

los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- no one knew him by his real name . but on the harsh streets of skid row that became his home , he was known as africa . surveillance footage , police and homeless community activists paint wildly different pictures of the man -- one who could be violent , benevolent , troubled and altruistic . africa was shot and killed by los angeles police sunday after he scuffled with officers . the shooting , caught on video , has renewed accusations of police brutality because it showed him already on the ground . police say he tried to reach for an officer 's gun . the los angeles county coroner 's office has identified africa , but is not releasing his real name pending notification of relatives . africa came to the united states from the continent about a decade ago , said a friend who would only be identified as nick g. like africa , nick had also been homeless on the streets of skid row -- a decrepit area wrought with poverty and despair . `` he wanted to get away from here , he wanted to go back home , '' nick said . `` he was very depressed . very , very depressed . he had a good side to him , a good heart . '' africa kept a tent outside the union rescue mission homeless shelter . even though the shelter was right in front of him , he did n't want the help . instead , africa often helped the shelter 's employees . `` our cleaning guys -- he would help them organize cleaning of -lrb- the -rrb- sidewalk , '' said the rev. andy bales , the shelter 's ceo . he described africa as gentle and kind -- but with an erratic side . `` i attribute the erratic behavior to this difficult environment out here . '' less than an hour before he was killed sunday , a nearby security camera showed africa apparently dealing drugs -- the sad and only real currency of skid row 's economy . the footage then shows africa getting into a fight with the man in the orange tent next to him , violently tipping the tent and kicking the man . police arrive and talk to africa , but he jumps into the tent -- prompting officers to draw their guns . africa then jumps out , swinging his arms at police . los angeles police say he tried to grab an officer 's gun , and that 's when he was shot . los angeles police chief charlie beck called the incident `` an extreme tragedy . '' `` we feel great compassion in the lapd for people who live in conditions of homelessness , and often mental illness , with no treatment , '' beck said . `` we prepare our officers to deal as best they can with them , but the reality is this is much more than a problem that the police alone can solve . '' bales said the dismal conditions of la 's skid row makes it a tinder box for more problems . `` there is no other major city in the u.s. that has a skid row like ours , '' he said . `` 2,000 human beings living on the street . until we deal with that , we 're going to continue to have an explosive situation . '' on the sidewalk where africa was shot , a modest memorial sits atop a small pile of belongings . `` rip cameroon , '' one cardboard sign reads `` rest in peace africa . '' it 's unclear when the los angeles county coroner 's office will release africa 's real name . from there , it 's unclear where africa 's remains will go . cnn 's kyung lah reported from los angeles ; holly yan reported and wrote from atlanta .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- she is being called zephany nurse , though it is not the name with which the 17-year-old south african girl grew up . zephany means `` hidden by the lord , '' a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence . south african police have been mostly quiet about the case . a police spokesman , andre traut , confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl 's biological mother . zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a cape town hospital in 1997 . she is 17 and in her final year of school . in fact , according to local reports , that 's how she crossed paths with her biological parents , celeste and morne nurse . according to the south african press association , an independent news agency , students at their second daughter 's school unknowingly solved the kidnapping . the second daughter , who was born four years after zephany was kidnapped , started eighth grade at a cape town school this year , according to sapa . fellow students told her there was a girl in her final year of school who looked just like her , the news agency reported . the two girls became friends , according to sapa , and eventually , morne nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter 's new friend . he , too , was taken by the similarities and contacted the police , sapa reported . a dna test was done , and last week police arrested the 50-year-old woman who had raised zephany . the woman made an initial appearance before a judge who ruled that she would remain behind bars at least until her next hearing . the shocking revelation has no easy conclusion . while zephany 's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her , for now , the girl is in the custody of the social services . the nurses have been allowed to visit zephany for short periods , south african media reported . and on tuesday , zephany herself released a statement , via the centre for child law , which is representing her . `` i want to say thank you to all the people who supported me through this , for continuously praying and never giving up on looking for me , '' she said . `` under the circumstances , i am doing fine . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- about 15 years ago , i was doing research on inheritance laws in malawi and their impact on women . part of my research methodology was to engage in focus group discussions with women in village settings . in order to do this in any village in malawi , one has to seek permission from the village chief . and so i did . the chief told me to come back the next day so that he can have time to mobilize the women , as well as give them proper notice of the proposed discussion . when i came back the next day , the `` women '' had indeed gathered waiting for me . however i noticed that the `` women '' were not women , as such . they were ... kids . teenage girls . i said to the chief `` i was hoping to talk to women and not to kids or girls , as i do n't think they would understand much about inheritance . '' his response was , `` but these are our women ; look , they have babies with them and they are all married . '' i was shocked . then it dawned on me , `` aah , girl-child marriages . '' after asking , i found the girls ' ages ranged from 13 to 18 , with two being 24 . this then spurred me into action and it was the beginning of a decade-plus journey of understanding girl-child marriages in my country and fighting for the practice to end . what i found out was disheartening as the statistics came in . i was horrified to learn that malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world . it is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the u.n. population fund . on average , one out of two girls in malawi will be married by their 18th birthday , according to the united nations . in 2010 , half of the women -lrb- 50 % -rrb- aged 20 -- 24 years were married or in a union before age 18 -lrb- compared to 6.4 % of boys -rrb- , while 12 % of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2 % of men . child marriage is in both rural and urban areas . it is also higher than the regional average for sub-saharan africa -lrb- 37 % -rrb- . ` law , save the girls ! ' being a lawyer , i looked to the law . `` my hero the law , save the girls , '' i thought ! yet , i soon found out that this was a complex story . the constitution of malawi , which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived , has provided for some measures of protection for all children . however the same constitution defines children as those aged 16 and below . the united nations defines children as those aged 18 and below and so to that extent the constitution does not comply with international standards on definitions of childhood . the constitution also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut-off point where marriage is actually prohibited . this means for all intents and purposes , the constitution of the republic of malawi allows child marriages . alas the law had failed me ! false hope ? but there was hope in the air . in february , malawi 's parliament passed the marriage , divorce & family relations bill of 2015 into law . this law was born amid the outcry against girl-child marriage , as the country had realized the dangers of girl-child marriage . save for a few areas , it is a very progressive piece of legislation , particularly from a women 's rights perspective . among other things , the law prohibits marriage for anybody below the age of 18 . so , does it mean that the constitutional provisions fall away ? the spanner in the works is that since the constitution allows marriage below the age of 18 , the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid . so whilst many have celebrated the new law , i have n't , as girls remain shackled by a constitutional provision that basically allows child marriage . so until the constitution changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above , and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated , i will remain sad as i was 15 years ago . ` guarantee for poverty ' i will remain sad because i know the cost of child marriage . it deprives girls of education and undermines their self-confidence and self-identity . it also makes them prone to physical and emotional abuse by their so called husbands . further to this , girl-child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality . as if this is not enough , studies have shown that girl-child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections , as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men . girl-child marriages need to be prohibited tough the constitution because they are a violation of every conceivable human right including the right to life , health , education , human dignity and development . what i know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and i want it to end . no ifs or buts . more from african voices . more from opinions . the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of seodi white .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- this has to be one of the least convincing scandals . during the four years that hillary clinton was secretary of state she used -lrb- brace yourselves -rrb- a personal email account ! perhaps she thought this was a way of ensuring that barack obama did n't read her emails . either way , republican attempts to turn this into hillary 's roswell fall short of the mark . on a scale of one to watergate , i 'd give this three . it is true that by using a commercial account , clinton opened herself up to being hacked . it is also true that the rules of the national archives and records administration stipulate that personal emails should only be used in `` emergency situations '' -- and as a historian i recognize the need for transparency and for keeping a record of everything written and sent for the appreciation of future generations . and we 'll recall , by the way , that officials in george w. bush 's administration did something like this -- using nonofficial email accounts for official business -- and were hounded by the democrats for it . but whenever clinton pinged an email to an official government account , then the conversation would still have been archived , and her office insists that emails from her personal account were handed over anyway . the suggestion that she thought she might have `` something to hide '' would only make sense if she had used her personal account on some occasions but not others . she would have to have been blessed with the gift of clairvoyance to know back in 2009 that there would some day be controversy surrounding her handling of a siege of a u.s. diplomatic compound in libya -- and that it might be best to use personal email so as to cover her tracks in the future . clinton may be many things , but the republicans have yet to throw the witchcraft charge . jeb bush is angry about clinton 's email farrago and has tweeted that transparency matters . he is keen that we should know that he has a website that documents all the email exchanges that he had as governor of florida . why on god 's earth he 's chosen to construct this archive , i ca n't imagine . it 's the kind of grand gesture that politicians imagine the voters will be swayed by but actually leaves us thinking , `` do n't you have better things to do than this ? '' or else wondering if there 's been some careful selecting of the emails to put the former governor in a good light . oh , there are some critical communications in the jeb bush archives . but i 'm suspicious that he appears never once to have been contacted by a nigerian prince to say that he has $ 12 million that he 's trying to transfer out of the country or by a russian lady looking for a husband . perhaps such conversations took place through bush 's personal account -- in which case , we need to know what he said in reply . of course there is a serious context to all of this : the benghazi hearings . there is still much that the public has yet to be told , and clinton 's emails may well be critical to discerning the truth . but there is a far less serious context to `` email-gate , '' too : the presidential election . literally every small slip that clinton has ever made is obviously going to be turned into a huge thing -- including such breaches of office etiquette as using the wrong email account . sources also told me that she sometimes puts her feet up on the desk and may have used the office phone for personal calls . wicked , wicked woman .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- lake waban on the southern edge of wellesley college is best known for its shoreline trails offering a scenic reprieve from campus life . freshman katy ma sees it in a different light after learning about xie bingxin , the influential 20th century chinese writer and activist who attended the massachusetts single-sex college in the 1920s . in one of bingxin 's poems , she describes the tranquil waters of lake waban as her only source of comfort in bouts of homesickness . now , lake waban provides ma with a tangible connection to a woman from another time , someone who rose to prominence after walking the same grounds as her . and , not just any woman , but someone who shares ma 's cultural roots . `` knowing that someone lived in the exact spot where you are right now , and knowing that so much came out of her life inspires you to think that you can accomplish just as much , '' she said . it 's a big deal for ma , who says she never learned about a single asian-american in school . as far as she knew growing in philadelphia , the white men featured in public monuments were the only people who made noteworthy contributions to history . she knows better now thanks to her involvement with activist group spark movement , which is putting women on the map , with a little help from google . ma and a group of girls around the world spent the past five months researching locations of significance in the lives of women who do n't always get a mention in history class . starting this week , their stories will be featured on google 's field trip app tagged to significant locations in their lives . for bingxin , it 's wellesley university . for dancer janet collins , it 's new york 's metropolitan opera , where she became the first african-american prima ballerina . for 19th century journalist annie smith peck , it 's musho , peru , the village at the base of mount huascarán , which she scaled in 1908 in a record-setting feat . for journalist nellie bly , it 's the site of women 's lunatic asylum on blackwell 's island , now roosevelt island in new york , where she went undercover for a story . most of the women have wikipedia pages or obits online ; far fewer have parks , squares or monuments named for them . `` every single one of these woman is a rock star , '' ma said . `` these women have been edited from history not because they did n't make meaningful contributions to society but because someone deemed their stories not worthy of being told . '' the initiative started in 2013 when spark approached google with data showing that women and people of color were underrepresented in the popular doodles featured on its search homepage . the google doodles team has since made strides toward balance the ratio . the encounter led to talks about another spark project on representation of women and people of color in parks , monuments and public spaces -- `` all the places outside a school textbook where we learn about who 's important in the world , '' spark executive director dana edell said . the conversations led to google 's niantic labs , creator of field trip . the app displays geotagged stories within a certain geographic radius created by different publishers . users can choose to be alerted to locations in a certain category . google agreed to publish the stories if spark created them . after all , spark 's vision fit into field trip 's goal to help people `` discover the stories around them , '' said google 's yennie solheim fuller , who worked with spark . `` it 's one thing to read about a landmark while sitting on your couch , '' she said . visiting it in person creates a sensory experience that 's harder to forget , and telling a story about the place has the potential to create an even stronger connection , she said . `` we 're hoping it brings more awareness to those locations and stories , '' she said . `` what i really hope is that people learn something cool about a place and a woman , and feel inspired to do something similar in their community . '' the initiative launched on monday featuring 119 women in 28 countries representing the arts , science and technology . the hard part was not finding women , 15-year-old spark member ajaita saini said . pinpointing locations to feature was the greater challenge , sometimes because of lack of information ; in other cases , it was hard to choose just one . take for example , deborah sampson , who disguised herself as a man so she could fight in the revolutionary war . the coordinates of her birthplace will show up for anyone using the app in the vicinity of plympton , massachusetts . the app also features mary anning , a 19th century british self-educated fossil hunter who was unable to publish her discoveries in her lifetime . the app highlights the british shore where she made some of her most significant findings , including the first complete skeleton of a long-necked plesiosaurus . saini , a student at middlesex county academy for science , mathematics and engineering technologies in new jersey , knows firsthand that women 's contributions to science , technology , engineering and math do n't usually make it into the lesson plan . through this project and other spark initiatives , she hopes to change that . `` it 's time we recognized the female scientists , researchers , musicians who are invisible to us , '' she said . `` they definitely existed , we just do n't learn about them .

'' `` doing business together '' might sum up the washington-tehran relationship today . they have overlapping interests in iraq , afghanistan , perhaps even in yemen -- as well as the shared goal of an agreement on iran 's nuclear program , if not how to reach it . the obama administration has a keen interest in coaxing iran back into the `` community of nations '' because it is a regional power , a major player in a volatile part of the world . were the nuclear talks to leave iran as a `` threshold state '' -- capable of becoming a nuclear power in short order -- turkey , egypt and others in the region also might be tempted also to go nuclear . and israel might carry out its threat of a military strike on iranian facilities . but u.s. and iranian interests converge in more immediate ways . defeating the islamic state in iraq and syria -lrb- isis -rrb- -- the most high profile and urgent objective of u.s. foreign policy -- requires iranian help , and quite a lot of it . beyond coalition airstrikes , ground forces are comprised of the iraqi security forces , shia militias and iranian advisers and officers . in some areas , the iranian air force has been active . on sunday , iraqi troops and the militias began an offensive to retake tikrit and the province of salahuddin from isis . next to mosul , tikrit may be isis ' most important holding in iraq . on the frontlines , according to the iranian fars news agency , was none other than the leader of iran 's quds force -lrb- or revolutionary guard corps -rrb- , qasem soleimani . soleimani -- often dubbed iran 's spymaster -- has huge influence in both baghdad and damascus . and the revolutionary guards have influence over the powerful shia militia in iraq known as hashid shaabi that is an important component of the fightback against isis . the institute for the study of war observed that `` the presence of an iranian general , other iranian advisers , and shia militias on the ground alongside iraqi sunni fighters to retake a major sunni provincial capital will be a significant test case for the success of similar future anti-isis operations . '' and not only is iranian help needed in defeating isis , but iranian restraint will be required in preserving iraq as a single and -lrb- dare one hope -rrb- stable state thereafter . to many observers , former iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki set the stage for isis ' rise through his increasingly sectarian and anti-sunni policies . but now the excesses of some shia militia in iraq threaten to alienate the sunni tribes that maliki 's successor , haidar al-abadi , is trying to woo . in a veiled reference to alleged abuses by shia militia of sunni civilians , prime minister abadi ordered all forces taking part in the tikrit operation to take `` utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property . '' but he needs tehran 's help in reining in the hashid shaabi . a similar environment may yet produce a u.s.-iranian `` understanding '' in yemen . the iranian-backed houthi militia -- a shia sect -- is now in power -lrb- at least in the capital , sanaa -rrb- . the houthis are , ostensibly , hostile to the united states , and washington would rather see president abdu rabu mansour hadi back in charge . but the houthis and yemeni troops are battling al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , which the u.s. regards as one of al qaeda 's most dangerous affiliates . even so , the same risk as in iraq applies : sunni tribes in yemen may side with aqap as the lesser of two evils , effectively partitioning the country . there is no clear-cut link between the negotiations on a nuclear deal and u.s.-iranian co-operation elsewhere . last week , u.s. director of national intelligence james clapper told a congressional hearing : `` i really do n't think that the negotiations , one way or the other , will have much bearing on what -lsb- the iranians -rsb- do in iraq or any place they are trying to exert their influence , meaning syria or now yemen . '' in any case , a substantive agreement on iran 's nuclear program does not seem imminent . ahead of yet another meeting in switzerland with iranian foreign minister mohammad javid zarif , u.s. secretary of state john kerry said monday that `` unless iran is able to make the difficult decisions that will be required , there wo n't be a deal . '' and he was at pains to insist the u.s. would not settle for anything less than a comprehensive , watertight agreement . `` no deal is better than a bad deal because a bad deal could actually make things less secure , '' kerry said . the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , is in the u.s. to tell congress that the deal being discussed is a bad one -- simultaneously injecting himself into the partisan rancor of washington and seeking to derail what would be the signature foreign policy achievement of obama 's second term . netanyahu appears to have accepted he is now part and parcel of the toxic atmosphere in washington , saying he was going `` because the american congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and iran . '' david rothkopf , no fan of obama 's policy on iran , wrote in foreign policy last month that `` netanyahu 's decision to accept -lsb- house speaker john -rsb- boehner 's invitation to address the u.s. congress on the dangers of the iran nuclear deal is a case of sending the wrong man at the wrong time to give the wrong speech in the wrong place . '' in the days running up to netanyahu 's speech , u.s. officials have lined up to warn of its consequences . national security advisor susan rice said the speech would be `` destructive of the fabric of the relationship '' between israel and the u.s. rarely if ever has the u.s.-israeli relationship become so imbued with such animosity . last summer , israeli ministers ridiculed kerry 's efforts to secure a ceasefire in gaza ; netanyahu has also repeatedly lectured obama about the realities of the middle east . now kerry seems to take almost gratuitous pleasure in telling netanyahu he is wrong . last week he told the house foreign affairs committee that interim agreements with iran had made israel safer , and the israeli prime minister `` was wrong '' to oppose them , just as he had been wrong in his enthusiastic support for the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2003 . some have even suggested that netanyahu 's aggressive opposition has only energized u.s. officials in the belief that `` if they 're doing something that really pisses off bibi , they must be doing something right , '' as rothkopf colorfully put it . no one would pretend that america has more in common with the islamic republic of iran than with israel . but right now , obama may just feel he 's more likely to find common ground with iranian president hassan rouhani than with the israeli prime minister . even so , the opportunities to `` do business '' should not be exaggerated . iran is still supporting -- with fighters , equipment , training and lines of credit -- bashar al-assad 's regime in syria , which the u.s. is trying to oust . iran and syria first bonded over a mutual loathing of saddam hussein , but the relationship has been sustained because the syrian regime was the only non-sunni government in the arab world , and damascus and tehran see themselves as the `` axis of resistance '' to israel . iranian training of militia such as the jaysh al-shabi has been critical to the assad regime 's survival . a former syrian prime minister , riyad hijab , said after defecting that `` syria is occupied by the iranian regime . the person who runs the country is not bashar al-assad but qasem soleimani . '' sanctions have made it difficult for iran to afford its hefty subsidies to the assad regime -- so ironically , a nuclear agreement and the easing of sanctions might have the unintended consequence of allowing iran to continue its support of assad . nor is there any sign that iran is ready to soften its support for the lebanese shia militia hezbollah , its frontline proxy in the confrontation with israel . eighteen months ago , columnist ali hashem quoted an iranian source as saying that `` hezbollah to iran is n't a card to play with . hezbollah today is the crown jewel of the resistance bloc , '' answerable not to the iranian president but to supreme leader ali khamenei . there 's no sign that posture has changed , and it 's a reminder that on all these issues , president rouhani is not the only -- or even the most powerful -- decision-maker in iran . all the same , the achievement of a nuclear deal - and the gradual lifting of u.s. and international sanctions against iran -- would surely change the mood music . it might open other doors and enhance dialogue on other issues . and regardless of progress on the nuclear front , the u.s. and iran will continue to share antipathy for the apocalyptic vision of isis , and an interest in buttressing iraq as a viable state . even as a candidate for the presidency , obama set out a vision for engaging with iran , not least to help bring stability to iraq . `` my decision making , with respect to military options versus diplomatic options , a containment strategy versus a strike strategy , '' he told the new york times in november 2007 , `` is going to be informed by how is that going to impact not just iran , but how is that going to impact the stability of the region and how 's that going to impact our long-term security interests . '' eight years on , it is diplomacy and containment that are the centerpiece of his administration 's thrust for a signature achievement on the world stage . and it ca n't hurt that the united states and iran find themselves on the same side , for now , in iraq .
hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- a canadian pastor is missing after going on a trip to north korea in late january , his family and church say . the rev. hyeon soo lim , 60 , went to north korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before , said lisa pak , a spokeswoman for his church , based in mississauga , ontario . on january 30 , lim traveled to north korea from china with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day . lim was scheduled to return february 4 from what was described as a `` routine '' trip to rajin , in northeastern north korea , where his church supports a nursery , orphanage and nursing home , according to the light korean presbyterian church . so far he has failed to show . the church has formally requested help in finding lim from canada 's department of foreign affairs , and has contacted the swedish embassy in pyongyang , which provides consular help for citizens of the united states , canada and australia , which do not have diplomatic ties with north korea . after not hearing from lim , pak said they thought he could have been caught up in north korea 's recent ebola policy . lim 's church and family waited the 21-day incubation period that he would have been under quarantine . in october , north korea announced it was taking `` preventive measures '' to `` control the infection by ebola . '' tour groups to north korea announced that the country would restrict its borders to international tourists because of concerns about ebola . this week , tour groups indicated that north korea may be easing its ebola policy . tour operators , including koryo tours , young pioneers tours and uri tours , announced on their websites that the country would ease its ban on foreign tourists . nick bonner , koryo tour 's co-founder and director , told cnn on tuesday , `` we 're pleased to announce that today marks the first time in more than four months that tourism in north korea begins to resume as normal . '' lim 's family released a statement , thanking the canadian government for its efforts to find the pastor and asking for privacy . in 1986 , lim immigrated to canada from south korea with his wife and son . he speaks fluent korean and leads a 3,000-member church . pak , the church 's spokeswoman , said she does n't believe lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing , which is prohibited in north korea . `` he knows the language , he knows the nature of the government , so we do n't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained , '' she said . `` we do n't believe that 's the way he would have behaved . he 's very wise about that . '' previously , north korea has detained westerners on religious grounds . cases include american kenneth bae , who was detained for two years after north korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities . bae was released in november . another american , jeffrey fowle , was arrested after leaving a bible at a club in north korea and released after five months in detention . aijalon mahli gomes , a u.s. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a christian activist , was released from north korea in 2010 after a visit to pyongyang by former u.s. president jimmy carter . cnn 's kj kwon contributed to this report from seoul , south korea .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- what a difference a couple of years makes . a federal judge has struck down nebraska 's ban on same-sex marriage , calling it an `` unabashedly gender-specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens . '' u.s. district judge joseph bataillon 's decision monday means that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states . nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th circuit u.s. court of appeals . bataillon denied a state request to stay his decision . and so , beginning monday the state must `` treat same-sex couples the same as different sex couples '' when it comes to marriage rights , the federal injunction reads . as the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages , the question now seems to be which state will be the last ? the number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the u.s. supreme court 's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal defense of marriage act . states like illinois , hawaii , minnesota and new york joined the fold voluntarily , while others -- most recently nebraska and alabama -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions . the case involving ohio , michigan , kentucky and tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in june by the u.s. supreme court . here 's the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same-sex marriages : . the state 's constitutional ban on gay marriage , passed in 2004 , was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a u.s. district court judge . local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision , but the state supreme court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case . a decision could come soon . georgia is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage . the other is north dakota . however , lawsuits are pending to overturn the state 's 2004 ban . the state 's ban is being challenged in state court , where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional , and in federal court , where a u.s. district court judge took the rare step , for a federal judge , of backing such a ban . the ban remains in place pending louisiana 's appeal of the state court ruling . on the federal level , a ruling is pending out of the u.s court of appeals for the fifth circuit , which heard arguments in the case in january . last year , a u.s. district court judge ruled that the state 's constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no `` legitimate purpose . '' the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit later overturned the ruling , reinstating gay marriage bans in kentucky and four other states . the kentucky ban is part of the u.s. supreme court case scheduled for arguments in april and a decision by june . a u.s. district court judge ruled last year that the state 's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional , resulting in the issuance of more than 300 marriage licenses . that ended when the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit granted a stay . the court later reinstated michigan 's ban in the same ruling that reinstated kentucky 's ban . its fate will be decided by the supreme court decision due by june . a state court judge ruled in november that missouri 's 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal . attorney general chris koster appealed the ruling to the state supreme court . but that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the u.s. supreme court decision . just a few days after that state court ruling , a u.s. district court judge struck down the state 's marriage ban , but that decision has been stayed pending appeals . while the state ban is in effect , officials in the st. louis area have issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples . a u.s. district court judge granted an injunction last year against the state 's same-sex marriage ban , describing it as unconstitutional . the judge , however , postponed his ruling from going into effect to give the state time to appeal . a federal appeals court heard arguments in the case in january . in the meantime , the same-sex marriage ban is still in effect . same-sex couples are challenging the state 's ban in u.s. district court , but a federal judge issued a ruling on january 20 delaying the proceedings until after the u.s. supreme court rules . u.s. district court judge karen schreier struck down the state 's same-sex marriage ban in january , but blocked enforcement pending an appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit . the state 's ban was struck down in january 2014 by a federal judge who said it serves `` no legitimate governmental purpose . '' but , as in many other states , enforcement was delayed pending appeals . the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit heard the case last month and a ruling is pending . a federal appeals court judge upheld a ban last year on same-sex marriages in the state . that decision is part of the u.s. supreme court case expected to be finalized this summer . in november 2014 , the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit upheld the state 's ban . that decision also will be part of the u.s. supreme court case .
new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- when prosecuting attorneys began their closing arguments in the terrorism trial of an accused al qaeda operative on monday morning , they spoke of blood . `` blood . mangled bodies and dead families , '' said assistant u.s. attorney zainab ahmad . `` abid naseer was going to place a car bomb in a crowded ... shopping center and watch people die . '' naseer , 28 , is accused of communicating with al qaeda and conspiring to attack the arndale shopping center in manchester , england , in april 2009 . naseer has maintained throughout the two-week trial that he is innocent , repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the united kingdom to find a wife , not to plan an attack . the case is now in the hands of the jury , who began deliberations tuesday . judge raymond dearie instructed the jury to `` judge the facts and the facts alone . '' naseer is charged with three criminal violations : providing material support to al qaeda , conspiring to provide material support for al qaeda , and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence . prosecutors accuse naseer of using email addresses with female names to communicate with al qaeda in planning the bomb attack . the `` female-sounding '' email addresses were created to attract less attention , prosecutors say . naseer , a pakistani national , was in the united kingdom on a student visa at the time of his arrest . prosecuting attorneys pointed to the fact that naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week as further evidence of his guilt . naseer had no intention of completing his studies because `` that was never the plan , '' ahmad said , arguing that naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack . `` if law enforcement had n't stopped him , he would be the martyr in heaven he so wanted to be . if he had not been stopped , hundreds of men , women , and children would be dead , '' ahmad said . the manchester plot was allegedly part of a three-pronged plan that also included attacks on the new york city subway system and on a newsroom in copenhagen . the new york plot originated with a man named najibullah zazi , who is believed to have corresponded with the same al qaeda contact as naseer . zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in naseer 's trial . naseer 's 2009 arrest in england was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in britain . he was extradited in january 2013 . a number of british intelligence agents -- disguised with makeup and wearing wigs -- testified that they tracked naseer in 2009 as he visited the manchester mall that was to be attacked . prosecutors also accuse naseer of using `` coded language '' in his emails to update al qaeda on his progress . email records show that naseer sent an email on april 3 , 2009 , to a man named sohaib , who naseer says he met randomly in an online chatroom . records also show that naseer used two email addresses to email sohaib exclusively from public computers and used different email addresses on his personal computer for all other correspondence . the email address belonging to sohaib has since been identified as one belonging to a member of al qaeda . the april 3 email reads , in part , `` we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month . i have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between those dates . '' `` nikah '' refers to an islamic marriage ceremony . naseer was arrested in manchester five days after sending the email . prosecutors allege that the wedding ceremony naseer mentions was coded language for an attack . the dates mentioned in the email , they argue , were not referring to a marriage , but rather naseer signaling to al qaeda when to expect the attack to happen . naseer , who has been representing himself , denied all charges . he told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence , with no witnesses offering direct information of naseer 's role in the alleged plot . they also did not offer any outright proof of any link to al qaeda or any other terrorist organization , he said . `` did anyone come forward , take the stand , and say abid naseer is the one responsible ? '' naseer asked the jury . `` we all know the answer . it is a two-letter word : no , '' he said . naseer argued that he dropped out of school because the courses , taught in english , were too difficult for him . a 2008 trip to pakistan , during which prosecutors allege naseer received al qaeda training , was really a trip to visit his ailing mother , naseer said . he said that he had no knowledge at the time that sohaib was connected to al qaeda in any way , and simply thought he was chatting with someone he met online . all correspondence mentioning multiple women and the planning of a marriage were genuine , he said . '' -lsb- i was -rsb- young and a bit desperate and wanted to settle down , '' naseer said , noting that there was nothing out of the ordinary about his search for a wife . naseer spent the majority of his closing argument reading from transcripts from earlier testimony , highlighting pertinent quotes he felt supported his cause . `` we 're not here to speculate , we 're here to prove facts , '' he said . evidence in the trial included documents seized from a 2011 raid in abottabad , pakistan , in which osama bin laden was killed . `` striking america at home is of the highest and top importance and is the main way to reach what we want , '' one letter said . `` the impact on americans from a strike inside america can not be compared with hitting them outside the country . '' naseer is not mentioned by name in any of the seized documents . he says he `` had no involvement in the activities mentioned . '' fbi agent alexander otte , who oversaw the evidence collected in the raid , testified before the jury that he watched as military forces walked off a plane with bags of seized evidence and the body of osama bin laden . other witnesses included multiple police officers and detectives from the manchester and london police departments , forensic investigators , a linguistic specialist and an al qaeda expert . surveillance officers who observed naseer for several weeks prior to his arrest also testified . the jury must reach a unanimous vote of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for a guilty verdict . if convicted , naseer faces life in prison .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- gen. david petraeus pleaded guilty tuesday to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information as part of a plea deal , court documents show . according to the documents , petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the international security assistance force in afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer , paula broadwell . on november 9 , 2012 , he resigned from his cia post , citing personal reasons . petraeus allegedly provided classified intelligence to his lover , broadwell , while he was director of the cia . the married mother of two and former military officer was writing a book about the general at the time . during his time as commander in afghanistan , petraeus kept personal notes including classified information in eight 5-by-8 inch black notebooks . the classified information including identity of covert officers , war strategy , notes from diplomatic and national security meetings and security code words . david petraeus fast facts . in august 2011 , according to the court documents , petraeus dropped off the notebooks to a house in washington , d.c. , so broadwell could access them . he later retrieved them and brought them to his home in arlington , va. . after petraeus resigned in 2012 he told the government he had no classified materials in his possession . that turned out not to be true when the fbi in april 2013 conducted a search of his house and found the black notebooks in an unlocked desk drawer in a first floor study . when he was questioned by the fbi , he lied and claimed that he had never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it , according to the court documents . the relationship came to light during an fbi investigation into a complaint that broadwell was allegedly sending harassing e-mails to another woman who was close to petraeus , a u.s. official told cnn in january . petraeus now works for new york private equity firm kkr & co. . lawyers for petraeus declined to comment .

islamabad , pakistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern pakistani city of peshawar for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine , an official said tuesday . peshawar deputy commissioner riaz khan mehsud told cnn that the 513 arrests took place monday and tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of pakistan 's khyber pakhtunkhwa province . those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated , according to the deputy commissioner . pakistan 's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons , including attacks on medical workers , the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families . whatever the reason , the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact . such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world . but pakistan is an exception , according to the global polio eradication initiative , a public-private partnership that includes the world health organization and united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- . the south asian nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years , and has nine of this year 's 10 reported cases . in 2014 , pakistan had 327 cases . the next closest country was nigeria , with 36 cases . authorities in khyber pakhtunkhwa province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops . they 've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago , mehsud said . dr. bilal ahmad , a unicef team leader based in pakistan , called authorities ' unprecedented move a last-ditch effort to clear polio from `` cluster '' zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated . `` first the workers -lrb- try to -rrb- convince them , then their supervisors , then senior members of the community , '' ahmad said . '' -lrb- this government action -rrb- is the final step in eradicating this issue . '' polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children , sometimes leading to paralysis and death . the virus is easily preventable through immunization , but there 's no cure once it is contracted . it went from being a health issue to a security issue after u.s. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for osama bin laden in 2011 . under cover of the program , the cia sought to collect dna samples from relatives of the al qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in abbottabad , pakistan . cia policy : wo n't use vaccination programs as part of operations . those administering the vaccines have become targets , with the national emergency operations center reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since december 2012 . and in june 2012 , pakistani taliban commander hafiz gul bahadur announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another pakistani province -- north waziristan -- because of drone strikes there . bahadur called the strikes `` worse than polio .

'' nneka 's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace , but the award-winning singer 's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a nigerian father and a german mother , nneka moved to hamburg at the age of 19 to study anthropology . whilst attending university , she also started exploring her musical talents , and soon found herself performing in various clubs opening up for top reggae and hip-hop names . in 2005 , she released `` victim of truth , '' a much-lauded debut that fused soulful beats , tasty hip-hop-and reflective ballads with politically-charged lyrics and black consciousness . since then , she went on to enjoy further chart success , tour extensively and collaborate with global stars like lenny kravitz and damian marley . and now , the soulful singer is back with a brand new , self-released album -- `` my fairy tales '' is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves , reggae-tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent 's most exciting -- and relevant -- artists . cnn 's african voices caught up with nneka in london to talk about music , memories and the current situation in nigeria -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the #asknneka and #cnnafrica hashtags . cnn : in the past , you 've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics , to religion and love -- what are the themes that you 're emphasizing at this moment ? nneka : what is happening in africa at present concerns me a lot . boko haram has always been an issue obviously for the past five , six years -- funny wise , there 's a track in the album called `` pray for you '' which i recorded when not too many people knew what was going with boko haram in the west . i 'm talking about the problems and possible solutions , and what are the reasons for the problems that we have . we as nigerians , we 're not united , that has always been the issue ... that 's our problem , tribalism , and what belongs to whom . i also talk about children and the future , bringing children into this world ... everyone 's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society , where your child is forced to live in fear . people are afraid to express themselves politically , and even in their home -- i remember the way we grew up , i did n't look my father in the eye until i was 22 ; you call your father `` sir , sir , sir '' -- apparently it 's a form of respect , ok , but respect should not be mistaken with fear . i was afraid and that 's the thing , that 's the colonial mentality : we mistake fear for respect . he -lsb- goodluck jonathan -rsb- says he wants to tackle boko haram , obviously every nigerian is asking why now , he could had done it a long time ago ... but i 'm not good at the whole blaming game , i do n't want to blame anybody but i pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy . but i know that fela -lsb- kuti -rsb- would definitely not be cool with him , seun -lsb- kuti -rsb- is not cool with him , and many other musicians who are very outspoken are not cool with him . cnn : what is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change ? nneka : music is very powerful , music is big ; music is even more powerful than politics at present . beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than -lsb- nigerian president -rsb- goodluck jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if beyonce is going to talk about boko haram , many people are going to listen , and if she had something to tell nigerians about love or whatever , many people are going to listen . cnn : how do you see the political and security situation now in nigeria ? nneka : all i can say is that we do need proper leadership . yes , that 's just easier said than done , but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change , we have to show that we want change , peacefully -- i love malcolm x but i 'd rather go for martin luther -lsb- king -rsb- -- peacefully . and be part of it , not just blame our leaders and making sure that you , yourself , contribute to the change that you want to see . your questions . nneka : my personal life always inspires me , in the first place , and then i try to expand it to the world . i try not to go too personal so that people can have their own interpretation of the song and also relate to it in their own special way . nneka : i like the prophet by kahlil gibran , i like things fall apart by chinua achebe , i like the bible . right now i 'm reading the humans by matt haig . read ! just read , educate yourself ! nneka : the way forward is going to be easier said than done , but tribalism is not they key . what we need is unity and to appreciate each other as nigerians , as africans , regardless of tribe and regardless of religion -- imposing your religion on other people is only going to create war and turmoil , there has to be another way . nneka : being on tour for like five months ; i mean you get used to the life , but -lsb- it 's hard -rsb- when you 're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you 're not around . nneka : it is successfully already , that 's why everybody is in it . that 's all i can say to that , it 's flourishing and they know it 's flourishing and that 's why they 're all there -- the chinese , the americans , the europeans and the rest of them .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's the day the music died . in the early morning hours of february 3 , 1959 , a small aircraft carrying buddy holly , ritchie valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson crashed a few miles from mason city municipal airport , near clear lake , iowa . pilot roger peterson also died in the crash . the voice of the hit songs `` peggy sue '' and `` that 'll be the day '' was silenced forever . a few months later , the civil aeronautics board blamed the accident primarily on the pilot 's lack of qualification and certification to fly solely by instruments and secondarily on an inadequate weather briefing . -lrb- pdf -rrb- . now , the national transportation safety board , the successor to the aeronautics board , may be taking another look . the ntsb received a letter from aviation enthusiast l.j. coon , a self-described retired pilot and aircraft dispatcher , asking it to look at other possible contributing factors to the crash . they include the aircraft 's weight and balance calculations -lrb- for passengers , baggage and fuel -rrb- , possible issues with rudder panels and possible carburetor induction icing , coon told cnn in an email . `` you have gotten our attention , '' the ntsb wrote in february , saying it would examine the information he provided , coon 's email said . the ntsb never fully closes a case , but any petition to re-examine a crash needs to show that there is new information suggesting the original probable cause is incorrect , ntsb spokesman eric weiss said . the agency has two months to review the petition and decide whether there 's new information that would make it revisit the case . in 1959 , holly , valens and richardson were part of the winter dance party , a tour that had started in milwaukee and traveled to small cities in minnesota and iowa . the musicians had traveled in subfreezing temperatures in unheated buses , and people were getting sick . holly booked the four-seat aircraft to fly to fargo , north dakota , where he planned to finally do laundry and rest in advance of the group 's next concert in nearby moorhead , minnesota . country legend waylon jennings , then holly 's bass player , gave up his seat to a sick richardson . jennings , who died in 2002 at age 64 , was haunted by his decision for years to come . dion and the belmonts were also on the tour , but dion gave up his seat on the plane after hearing the $ 36 per-person price tag . he was the only headliner not on the plane and the only headliner who did n't die that night . fans remember ` the day the music died ' the crash has inspired generations of artists . lou diamond phillips played ritchie valens -lrb- originally valenzuela -rrb- in the 1987 hit movie `` la bamba . '' gary busey played holly in the 1978 movie `` the buddy holly story . '' don mclean , who was inspired by holly 's music , memorialized that day as `` the day the music died '' in his 1971 song `` american pie . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- she 's leaving . she 's not leaving . dame maggie smith , whose tart-tongued lady violet crawley has most of the best lines on `` downton abbey , '' caused a fuss this week when she implied that her beloved character wo n't be around much longer . `` i mean , -lrb- my character -rrb- certainly ca n't keep going , '' smith told the sunday times . `` to my knowledge , i must be 110 by now . we 're into the late 1920s . '' no more dowager countess ?!? you could almost hear the genteel wails of protest on both sides of the atlantic . the speculation about smith was hurriedly squashed by a `` downton '' publicist , who said smith , 80 , has agreed to stay with the series `` for as long as the show runs . '' but that did n't stop rumors about the demise of `` downton '' itself from continuing to crop up . smith even hinted during her interview with the times that the next season of the hit show would be its last . `` they say this is the last one , and i ca n't see how it could go on , '' smith let drop . creator julian fellowes is developing another period drama , `` the gilded age , '' for nbc and has been noncommittal about how much longer the show might endure beyond season six , which is filming now . `` it wo n't go on forever -- i 'm not a believer in that , '' he told the new york times in a recent interview . `` but i ca n't immediately now tell you where the end will be . '' it is hard to imagine `` downton , '' which just wrapped its fifth season on pbs in the united states , without the wit and wisdom of lady violet , whose acerbic commentary leaves few around her unscathed . so let 's hope smith just misspoke . and until season six , which airs this fall in the uk and early next year in the united states , here are some of our favorite dowager countess zingers . -- isobel : `` how you hate to be wrong . '' lady violet : `` i would n't know , i 'm not familiar with the sensation . '' -- robert : `` they do say there 's a wild man inside all of us . '' lady violet : `` if only he would stay inside . '' -- isobel : `` i admire it when young people stand up for their principles . '' lady violet : `` principles are like prayers ; noble , of course , but awkward at a party . '' -- lady violet -lrb- to cora -rrb- : `` i 'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again . when i 'm with her , i 'm reminded of the virtues of the english . '' matthew : `` but is n't she american ? '' lady violet : `` exactly . '' -- isobel : `` i take that as a compliment . '' lady violet : `` i must have said it wrong . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- if the 20th century was the century of the skyscraper , then the 21st century is shaping up as the century of the `` plyscaper . '' despite its historical reputation for great city fires -- london in 1666 , the great chicago fire of 1871 and san francisco in 1906 -- wood is making a comeback as a construction material . next year in vienna , construction will begin on a 275-foot building made almost entirely of wood , while stockholm may build a 34-story wooden apartment by 2023 . others are in the pipeline from canada to australia to europe . with faster construction times and a softer environmental impact , could the building material of the past be the future of construction ? vancouver-based architect michael green says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings . his firm mga recently completed a 29.5 m -lrb- 97 feet -rrb- wooden building , the wood innovation and design center in prince george , northern british columbia . but he said news of taller wooden structures is sprouting up all the time . `` there seems to be a new announcement every two or three weeks , '' green said . `` we 've got one in vancouver for 18 stories and in vienna there 's one for more than 20 stories . `` we 've done research in high earthquake zones that show 30 stories is feasible ; we certainly think we can go to 40 and higher . '' he said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game-changer for construction . mass timber panels , in particular , cross-laminated timber -lrb- known in the industry simply as clt -rrb- are becoming established as a quicker , greener and eventually cheaper alternative to concrete and steel . one great bonus of the material is the speed of construction ; panels can be made to measure in the factory complete with openings , windows and doors . while the main advantages of working in wood are manifold -- it 's flexible , robust and easily worked -- green says wood may be the only material to address the growing problems of urbanization . `` wood has not been an urban material so we looked at how it could be a contributor to urban environments , '' he said . `` there are a whole host of advantages . `` steel and concrete have huge carbon footprints . concrete accounts for about 6-8 % of man 's greenhouse gas emissions , whereas wood stores carbon dioxide and gives us a vehicle to create carbon-neutral buildings . '' the energy used to harvest wood , he said , is much less than the enormous amount required to produce concrete and steel . `` there is no other building material that is grown by the sun , '' he said . `` we 've calculated that the north american forests grow enough wood for a 20-story wood building every 8-10 minutes . '' ultimately , building in wood , green argues , creates an economic incentive to plant more forests . `` the climate story is really happening at both ends of the argument -- by using more wood we encourage countries around the world to plant more trees . `` about 20 % of man 's carbon footprint comes from deforestation , this creates an important incentive for reforestation , '' he said . in terms of carbon footprint , a 20-story plyscraper put against its counterpart in concrete and steel is the equivalent of taking 900 cars off the road for a year , mga estimates . but the established nature of concrete and steel means that clt will not replace urban building materials overnight . concerns over fire and inherent problems with its acoustic qualities -lrb- apartments need additional acoustic measures to keep noise from traveling -rrb- have meant that the construction establishment has been slow to come to the party . in vienna , for example , the austrian fire services are working with architects to test their plans . `` the main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings . an 84-meter-high building in europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realized , '' fire service spokesman christian wegner told the guardian newspaper . `` a few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet . `` they have to carry out special tests on the correct combination of concrete and wood . we also want to develop a more fail-safe sprinkler system . i expect they will pass the tests but if they develop the building as they say they will , it will be a serious project . '' green counters that clt is as fire resistant as other new-builds made by traditional means and likens its ability to burn to trying to set a redwood on fire with a lit match , with any charring creating an insulation layer that protects the wood underneath . even so , the industry remains largely skeptical of a process that -- while having obvious advantages in terms of speed -- is still on par with steel and concrete construction in terms of cost . `` it will become cheaper but it 's too new to be significantly less expensive , '' green said , adding that the difficulty lies in competing with a well-honed and century-old system of designing , building and budgeting for concrete and steel . `` the culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative , '' he said . `` the hardest part of my job is not the engineering and the design or the innovation , it 's really about changing the public 's perception of what 's possible . '' ultimately , buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel ; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood . leading timber specialist at the engineering group arup , andrew lawrence , said that shear walls -- the core of tall buildings which provide stability against the lateral force of the wind or seismic activity -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel . however , the real savings from wood come when all the cost elements of making a tall building are taken into account . `` clients are missing a trick with wood , '' he said , adding that dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete . `` what you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset . `` you will save on the program because it 's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially , if you 're making an office building , you can leave a lot of the wood exposed , saving on the cost and time of installing finishes . '' apart from having a sustainable solution , lawrence says , clients will gain a building that looks good too . `` if you leave the wood exposed , you can have a really nice environment inside the building , '' he says . `` there are studies that show that people are happier inside wood structures . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- england 's abject cricket world cup record endures . its team has been eliminated before the group stages of the competition has even finished after a demoralizing defeat to bangladesh , who qualified for the quarterfinals . it means england , who invented the game of cricket but has never won the world cup , still has n't been past the last eight stage of the one-day tournament since 1992 . chasing a target of 276 off its 50 overs in adelaide , australia , england slumped to 260 all out , with only jos buttler offering any meaningful resistance . the wicketkeeper struck a brisk 65 after england 's top order failed to lay a platform for victory , before he was dismissed by taskin ahmed . england captain eoin morgan failed again with the bat , lasting just three balls before succumbing to rubel hossain for no score . it marks another miserable display from one of cricket 's supposed powerhouses on the world stage , its only victory in the 2015 competition coming against minnows scotland . whereas other teams in the tournament have taken an aggressive approach , some posting totals of over 400 , england 's modus operandi has looked slovenly and outdated . `` pretty poor to be knocked out of a world cup so early , it is very disappointing , '' morgan said at the post-match presentation . `` i ca n't put my finger on it at the moment . i 'm gutted . we 've struggled and fought our way since we arrived -- one of our big things was to fight hard and try to get through to the quarterfinals . `` our expectations are much higher than this . i 've no idea what happens from here -- it 's a surprise we 're out this early . there will be an inquest over the next few weeks and we 'll go from there . '' coach peter moores is bound to come in for renewed criticism , and the clamor for the return of one of england 's best one-day players -- kevin pietersen -- is sure to grow louder . south african-born pietersen was sacked after the disastrous tour to australia in 2014/15 , the england and wales cricket board saying he was a disruptive dressing room influence . `` it 's a hollow feeling at the moment , '' moores said after england 's defeat . `` you feel like you have let people down . '' despite committing a year to prepare for the world cup , england dismissed alastair cook as skipper less than two months before the tournament in australia and new zealand began . mahmudullah was bangladesh 's hero , scoring the country 's first ever century at the world cup , as it recorded one of the biggest wins in its history . england now face a dead rubber against afghanistan on friday while bangladesh has cemented its place in the last eight .

'' `` there is nothing that proves what is being circulated in the media , especially through video clips and footage , that the accused is my son mohammed , who is being referred to as the alleged executioner '' of isis , jassem emwazi told the kuwaiti newspaper al qabas . jassem emwazi said there are only `` false rumors '' circulating about his son . the elder emwazi told the newspaper he has hired an attorney . the lawyer , kuwait-based salem al-hashash , told cnn on tuesday that he was representing jassem emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that mohammed emwazi is jihadi john . the lawyer called the father a `` victim of libel '' and said that he would soon hold a news conference . last week , two u.s. officials and two u.s. congressional sources confirmed to cnn that `` jihadi john '' is mohammed emwazi , a kuwaiti-born londoner . jassem emwazi 's statements to al qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized jihadi john 's voice as her son 's when she saw footage that shows the man , whose face is covered , brandishing a knife and threatening isis hostages . emwazi told british newspaper the guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false . `` lie , lie , lie , '' he reportedly said . mohammed emwazi was born in kuwait in 1988 and moved to the united kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six , according to cage , an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism . cage interacted with emwazi before he joined the terror group , a member has said . cage released a recording last week that it said it taped of mohammed emwazi in 2009 . in that recording , emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by british intelligence service regarding a july 2005 terror attack in london . cnn 's samira said , roba alhenawi and nic robertson contributed to this report .
los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands of veterans who are patients at the va greater los angeles healthcare system have been waiting months just for an appointment , cnn has learned . email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com . what 's more , administrators in charge of the massive va facility in greater los angeles may have been hiding wait times , and may have misled congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care , according to new information obtained by cnn . this revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans , which embroiled the u.s. department of veterans affairs last year and even led to the resignation of va secretary eric shinseki , is apparently not over . and the changes promised by the va and the obama administration may not be working . the detailed new evidence comes from the los angeles va 's own internal documents obtained by cnn , and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information . it is particularly significant as the greater los angeles veterans medical center is the nation 's largest va health care system , caring for hundreds of thousands of u.s. veterans . the va documents show more than 12,700 appointments , which the va calls consults , had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed , as of mid-january . even new patients seeking care at the los angeles va for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there . records show on january 15 , more than 1,600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments . another 400 veterans have waited up to six months , and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments . the documents provided to cnn show the lengthy wait times are still happening , within the last several months , and sources say the backlog is happening even now . and yet last month , the va 's acting director for the western region overseeing the los angeles va told congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments . `` the average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days , '' dr. skye mcdougall , the acting director of the desert pacific healthcare network , veterans health administration , testified before the house committee on veterans ' affairs . but mcdougall 's statement is simply not true . according to the los angeles va 's documents dated january 15 , the actual average wait time for new patients at the va was 48 days . a half-dozen medical and administrative sources inside the la va system corroborate these waits . the wait times since then have not changed significantly -- coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of march 1 , according to another va document -- and are still roughly 10 times what mcdougall testified they were . the delays in appointments are even taking place at los angeles clinics for mental health , where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30 , 60 , even 90 days for treatment . at the congressional hearing , mcdougall was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients , a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year . the uncounted : war 's true toll . asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the los angeles va , mcdougall testified that the same number -- a four days ' wait for new patients -- applies for mental health . but that is also not true , according to the documents and sources inside the va who spoke with cnn . a new la va chart shows as of march 1 , new mental health patients in los angeles are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment . los angeles va officials would not talk to cnn about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the `` greater los angeles and va nationwide continues to work very hard to get veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve . '' the va sent cnn new `` retrospective data '' showing primary care average wait times of four days , specialty care wait times of 7.5 days , and mental health wait times of 2.5 days , as of january . the va explained that the chart for new patients obtained by cnn `` does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those veterans who need care quickly ... '' new patients , the va told cnn , `` typically account for less than 10 % of all veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population . '' despite the `` retrospective data , '' the real truth , say the sources cnn has interviewed , is reflected in the internal la va documents obtained by cnn -- that wait times for many patients at the los angeles va medical centers extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem . this news of continuing delays in los angeles comes a year after reports of cover-ups and turmoil at the va , which became a national scandal , where wait times , veterans ' deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at va hospitals across the country . congress even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly , as a direct result of the scandal . and since the scandal , congress has approved $ 16 billion extra for the va in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities . the va removed its 14-day scheduling goal to discourage engaging in `` inappropriate scheduling practices , '' and president barack obama also appointed a new va secretary , robert mcdonald , last summer . vets not impressed with va reforms . sources in the greater los angeles va say despite the scandal last year , the new secretary , the new laws and all the attention , not much has changed . watch anderson cooper 360 ° weeknights 8pm et . for the latest from ac360 ° click here .
los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- conrad hilton , the younger brother of celebrity heiress paris hilton , has reached a plea deal : he would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped , court papers says . the deal would require prosecutors to recommend probation for hilton , who also allegedly called passengers `` peasants '' on a london-to-los angeles flight last summer . hilton , 20 , is scheduled to appear thursday in federal court , but he is not expected to plead guilty at that time , said spokesman thom mrozek of the u.s. attorney 's office . hilton , who is free on $ 100,000 bond , was initially charged with a felony that could have carried a prison sentence up to 20 years upon a conviction . the misdemeanor charge carries up to a six-month prison sentence and a fine of at least $ 5,000 , but federal prosecutors have agreed that they would `` recommend that defendant be sentenced to a term of probation , '' court records said . the class b misdemeanor accuses hilton of assaulting two flight attendants aboard a british airways flight on july 31 , 2014 , `` by intentionally using a display of force that reasonably caused -lrb- the attendants -rrb- to fear immediate bodily harm , '' according to court documents filed last week . hilton signed court papers last week that state he `` repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco '' during flight 269 from london to los angeles , court papers said . read the plea deal . `` he also become belligerent toward some of the flight attendants , '' according to court papers signed by hilton and his attorney . his attorney could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday . at one point , hilton told one flight attendant multiple times that `` i am going to f ------ kill you , '' according to the court papers . hilton also `` punched at , but missed '' another flight attendant , the court documents said . a more complete description of events aboard the flight was provided in initial court papers filed in early february . those alleged hilton threatened and intimidated flight attendants , scared parents and disengaged a bathroom smoke alarm . the court documents alleged hilton punched the bulkhead next to an attendant 's head , missing his face by about 4 inches , and told the crew , `` i could get you all fired in five minutes . i know your boss ! '' `` my father will pay this out , he has done it before . dad paid $ 300,000 last time , '' hilton allegedly told a flight attendant . hilton 's father is rick hilton , the grandson of the hilton hotel empire 's founder , conrad nicholson hilton . rick hilton and his wife of more than 30 years , kathy , are parents of four children : paris , nicky , barron and conrad . conrad hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff , even though the `` fasten seat belt '' sign was still on , authorities said . another flight attendant said hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10 1/2 - hour flight , court documents said . read the initial federal complaint -lrb- warning : profane language -rrb- . when hilton became enraged because a flight attendant was following him , he shouted several times that `` i am going to f ------ kill you ! '' and used other vulgarities , court papers said . passengers became frightened and disturbed , authorities said . a french family was seated behind hilton , and the father got out of his seat and leaned `` over his kids in a protective gesture '' during one of hilton 's rants , a flight attendant told authorities , according to court papers . hilton yelled several times , saying `` i will f ------ own anyone on this flight ; they are f ------ peasants . '' hilton also accused the flight attendants of `` taking the peasants ' side '' and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend , court papers said . he bragged that he was already banned by other airlines . at some point during the flight , the attendant saw hilton go into a bathroom and smelled cigarette smoke coming from it , authorities said . the flight 's pilot , who was second-in-command to the captain , `` noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels , apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding , '' court papers said . the pilot later confronted hilton , and hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter , authorities said . hilton returned to his seat and fell asleep . the captain authorized crew members to form a `` restraint team '' to constrain hilton before he woke up , authorities said in court papers . the crew used a blanket and handcuffs on hilton about 75 minutes before the plane landed , authorities said . he awoke while being restrained and began screaming obscenities , court documents said . `` as hilton was being restrained , he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were ` going to ruin my career , ' '' according to an affidavit by fbi agent david gates filed in court in early february . later , in an interview with the fbi the same day , hilton said he started his travels in mykonos , greece , had a connection in athens , and then traveled to london , authorities said . he took a sleeping pill before boarding the flight to los angeles , court papers said . hilton admitted to calling people `` peasants '' on the flight , but he `` denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants , '' the affidavit said . hilton allegedly told the fbi agent : `` i told all of them i could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds , '' the affidavit said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there is only one likely outcome for baghdad 's current military offensive to reclaim tikrit : defeat for isis . the campaign to restore central government authority over the restive salahudin province is seen as both symbolic and strategic for baghdad which has invested too much already for it to afford losing this battle . isis are said to have booby-trapped much of the city in an attempt to slow down the government assault . however , the task at hand has been made easier for baghdad given that most civilians in tikrit have already fled -- both to kurdistan in the north as well as south to baghdad -- leaving behind mostly isis jihadists who defend the city , according to iraqi constitutional specialist zaid al-ali , who is from the city . initial reports of the multi-pronged attack on tikrit have been encouraging . iraqi forces have already cleared a number of areas on the outskirts and are expected to continue advancing towards the city center as both heavy artillery and helicopter gunships pound isis militants who have taken up defensive positions . another crucial element for the success of this battle will be the varied make-up of the groups involved in the fight . the joint iraqi forces fighting to retake tikrit include iraqi troops , members of the mainly shia hashd al-shabi paramilitary force , members of the sunni sons of salahuddin brigades , and other sunni tribal fighters . the offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all . although the campaign is iraqi-led , help from outside is also going to play an important role . though the united states has not conducted any airstrikes in this campaign yet , this may well change as the battle develops . iran , in stark contrast to the u.s. , provided iraq with immediate and much-needed military assistance when the security crisis escalated last june . the iranians are heavily invested in this current campaign and are also not going to let the iraqis lose . unlike in syria , the americans and iranians both share a common enemy and a common friend in iraq , but due to wider political considerations neither washington nor tehran will admit that there is any form of tacit cooperation in iraq . however , the campaign for tikrit is just another front where such cooperation is likely to be already happening behind the scenes . baghdad will make use of u.s. intelligence that will almost certainly be shared with the iranian officers who are advising the iraqi army . general qasim suleimani , the commander of the iranian revolutionary guard quds force , who has played a key role in the fight against isis , was reported to be near tikrit just hours after the military campaign was officially launched . iran provides military advice , support and weapons not just through the central government in baghdad but also directly to a number of increasingly powerful shia militia groups that now operate under the state-sponsored paramilitary committee , the hashd al-shabi , known as the `` popular mobilization units . '' the two key iraqi leaders of this paramilitary command , hadi al-ameri and abu mehdi al-mohandis , were also pictured together with general fadhil barwari , the commander of iraq 's elite special operation forces . though there are few civilians left in tikrit , all eyes will be on the iraqi security forces -- and especially the shia militias -- to see if abuses are carried out once the enemy is routed . prime minister abadi already warned the anti-isis fighters to protect civilians and properties in the area and also gave the `` misled '' isis militants a last chance to lay down their arms before the troops made their advance . the battle is an especially emotional one for the shia soldiers and fighters as tikrit is the site of the camp speicher massacre last june , where 1,700 shia soldiers were captured , separated from their sunni comrades and then summarily executed in an atrocity that was documented by isis as a powerful propaganda film . however , it is encouraging that both shia and sunni fighters are supporting the army in its effort to defeat isis . the cooperation between shia and sunni fighters will be crucial not just in the ongoing offensive in tikrit but will also set the stage for further cooperation in the strategic campaign to recapture mosul . politically , these groups may not see eye-to-eye and of course there remain deep ethno-sectarian tensions in iraq and beyond , but regardless of these differences they all view isis as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated . to be sure , the sunni tribesmen involved in this campaign are more anti-isis than they are pro-government , but that they can work with the pro-government shia militias is both good news and good progress for a country believed to be ripping itself apart along ethno-sectarian lines .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- here are some of the names you might be hearing about as dzhokhar tsarnaev goes on trial in the 2013 boston marathon bombings : . • dzhokhar `` jahar '' tsarnaev : born july 22 , 1993 , tsarnaev and his family immigrated to the united states and applied for political asylum when he was 8 . a popular student , tsarnaev attended cambridge rindge and latin school and was captain of his high school wrestling team . he received a $ 2,500 scholarship from the city of cambridge , massachusetts , and attended the university of massachusetts-dartmouth . tsarnaev was known on campus for selling marijuana , according to court testimony . he became a naturalized u.s. citizen in september 2012 , seven months before the bombings . federal agents say surveillance video captured him near the second blast site , where 8-year-old martin richards was killed . after the bombings , tsarnaev returned to campus and stayed there until the fbi publicly identified him as a suspect . tsarnaev texted a friend to come to his room and take whatever he wanted as he would not be coming back . he and older brother tamerlan went on the run , allegedly killing an mit officer , carjacking an suv and engaging watertown , massachusetts , police in a firefight . tamerlan tsarnaev was killed , and dzhokhar was discovered the next day , badly wounded , hiding in a boat . • tamerlan tsarnaev : tamerlan tsarnaev , born october 21 , 1986 , was an accomplished boxer . he won the new england golden gloves heavyweight division in 2009-2010 . known for his flashy clothes and in-your-face self-confidence , tamerlan aspired to join the u.s. boxing team despite being only a permanent resident and therefore ineligible . in early 2011 , russia asked the fbi to look at tsarnaev 's activities . after interviewing tsarnaev and family members , the fbi said it `` did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government . '' in january 2012 , tsarnaev left new york for russia . it 's not clear what he did while there , but tsarnaev 's father has said his son was with him at all times . he returned to the united states in july 2012 . seventy-two hours before the bombing , he was seen working out at the wai kru mixed martial arts gym with his younger brother . he was killed following a gunfight with watertown police after his brother tried to free him with a stolen suv but ran him down instead , according to an indictment against the younger tsarnaev . • anzor tsarnaev : anzor tsarnaev is the father of the tsarnaev brothers . originally from chechnya , the family was exiled by russians and settled in the former soviet republic of kyrgyzstan before seeking political asylum in the united states . the elder tsarnaev fixed cars for a living , making ends meet through welfare . he and wife zubeidat divorced in 2011 , and he returned to the russian republic of dagestan , where he now lives . • zubeidat tsarnaeva : mother zubeidat tsarnaeva worked as a home health aide before switching to facials and skin care , both at a local spa and in her cambridge home . she was charged with shoplifting in summer 2012 and soon after moved to dagestan . if she returns to the united states , she could be arrested for failing to resolve the shoplifting charges . she has phoned several times during her younger son 's incarceration . • ailina tsarnaeva : ailina tsarnaeva is the sister of the tsarnaev brothers . at age 16 , she entered an arranged marriage that produced a son and lasted little more than a year , according to an investigative piece by the boston globe . last year , tsarnaeva was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment , accused of making a bomb threat against the mother of her boyfriend 's child . she denies the charge . her last known address was in north bergen , new jersey , near her sister and the widow of tamerlan tsarnaev . • bella tsarnaeva : sister bella tsarnaev also reportedly has a child from a failed marriage , according to the boston globe . she was arrested in new jersey on marijuana charges , and she entered into a pretrial intervention program . • katherine russell : raised as a christian in providence , rhode island , `` katie , '' as she was known in high school , went to suffolk university in boston but dropped out before graduating . she married tamerlan tsarnaev in 2010 in a small , private ceremony officiated by a boston imam . she worked as a home health aide to support the couple 's young daughter . her last known apartment was just blocks from the last listed address of ailina and bella tsarnaeva , her sisters-in-law . by all indications , russell has chosen to be near -- and with -- her dead husband 's family in new jersey , rather than with her parents in rhode island . russell had one dust-up with the law -- a june 2007 arrest for stealing $ 67 in goods from old navy . she acknowledged the theft and gave back the merchandise , according to court records . • ruslan tsarni : the uncle of the accused bombing suspect , he widely condemned the attack on the boston marathon , saying nephew tamerlan `` messed up his life , that 's why he decided -lrb- to -rrb- take lives of innocent people . '' • ibragim todashev : ibragrim todashev was tamerlan 's sparring partner at the wai kru mixed martial arts gym near cambridge . the two bonded over chechnya and religion , sometimes laying out rugs to pray to mecca inside the small gym . todashev moved to florida in fall 2011 , not long after a brutal triple slaying in waltham , massachusetts . one of the victims was fellow sparring partner brendan mess who , along with two friends , were nearly decapitated , with marijuana strewn over their bodies . authorities began taking a closer look at possible involvement by both tamerlan tsarnaev and todashev , who was allegedly writing out a `` confession '' when , authorities say , he tried to attack an fbi agent . the agent fatally shot todashev , whose family maintains he is innocent . • dias kadyrbayev : dias kadyrbayev , a friend of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's , pleaded guilty to `` obstructing justice with the intent to impede the boston marathon bombing investigation , '' and he also pleaded guilty to conspiracy with his actions in the days immediately following the bombing . kadyrbayev was charged with four counts , including obstructing justice and conspiracy for throwing tsarnaev 's backpack into a trash bin after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder , and removing a jar of vaseline and a computer thumb drive . investigators later recovered the backpack at a landfill . kadyrbayev also took tsarnaev 's computer to his off-campus apartment , where the fbi later seized it . he is awaiting sentencing . 13th juror : fishy case could silence accused bomber 's pals . • azamat tazhayakov : in july , a jury found azamat tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from dzhokhar tsarnaev 's dorm room after the bombings . tazhayakov was another friend of tsarnaev 's and was kadyrbayev 's roommate . kadyrbayev and tazhayakov are both nationals of kazakhstan who were temporarily living in the united states on student visas while attending the university of massachusetts-dartmouth . tazhayakov is expected to appeal . • robel phillipos : robel phillipos , also a friend of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's , was convicted in october on two counts of lying to federal agents investigating the 2013 bombing . prosecutors said phillipos lied to investigators about being in tsarnaev 's college dorm room at the university of massachusetts-dartmouth after the bombings . phillipos knew tsarnaev from high school . according to court documents , phillipos had n't seen or talked to tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing . phillipos has filed a motion for judgment of acquittal and new trial .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a decade ago al qaeda would meet potential recruits face to face ; now isis engages in one-to-one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away . with what it says is a $ 2 billion budget , the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka-clad jihadi brides carry kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian caliphate and a `` guaranteed ticket to paradise . '' aqsa mahmood , 19 , left home for university one morning in november 2013 never to return . instead of going to classes , she travelled to syria ; last february she married a jihadi fighter , and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for isis . what is so unusual about aqsa is that she was given every chance in life : privately educated and offered freedoms that many other muslim girls would envy . and while most were quick to condemn the mahmood family for missing the signs of radicalization , 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- aqsa 's parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites . following the terror attacks in london on july 7 , 2005 , the then prime minister tony blair insisted those responsible were motivated by an `` evil ideology , '' a `` perversion of islam that promoted absurd grievances , '' and that they had nothing to do with the war in iraq , but he was wrong : the iraq `` adventure '' opened the gates of hell , and today young muslims are being seduced by an updated narrative . for over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day muslims . the need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques . every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so-called `` muslim leaders , '' further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young muslims away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that `` islam is a religion of peace . '' it is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents , but the steady stream of recruits to isis can not be ignored . several years ago al qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in arabic in front of a black flag , followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards americans . it was n't particularly effective as a recruitment tool , but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever . today isis runs a powerful , slick , modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms . their propaganda contains the same violent , distorted interpretation of islam but it is more advanced than anything al qaeda ever produced , and the authorities can not police it or compete with it . for many , the greatest shock has been young girls like aqsa wanting to leave behind their western comforts and freedoms to join isis , but why should it be a surprise that young muslim women are as angry as their male counterparts ? there is no single road map to recruitment , but for a teenager becoming a jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber , however distorted that logic may seem to us . full of adolescent frustration , young muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by isis . it does n't matter if the narrative is false , because isis is winning the propaganda war : the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the muslim community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers . isis is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy , israel , rendition , torture , or assad 's reign , which has left 200,000 dead , because there is nothing that western governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards . aqsa 's family describe her as a `` bedroom radical '' of the type the british government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media . yet last year the international centre for the study of radicalisation and political violence found `` little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization . '' a concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists . many young muslim people asserting their identity in an islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders , whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day islam . while mosques pay lip service to the `` brotherhood of man '' they exclude 50 % of the community by discouraging women from attending , and anyone below the age of fifty is told to shut up and show respect . as for racial unity , it is at best tokenistic and at worst institutionally racist . young british muslims live a schizophrenic existence , stuck between their immigrant parents ' cultural identity and that of the west which does n't want them . extremists exploit this identity crisis by offering them a new life . most parents would n't know if their teenagers were drinking or having sex , let alone being groomed by isis ; many young muslims -- already adept at living a double life -- will hide their digital footprint in exactly the same way . in many cases , there is tremendous relief for parents when a teenager comes home one day and announces she is becoming religious , rather than saying she is pregnant or on drugs , but it also gives rise to a false sense of security . the failure to deal with the grooming of underage girls by isis is a child protection issue : when a paedophile makes contact with a child , he builds up trust over several months , convincing the child not discuss anything with her parents . when the time is right he convinces the child to leave her family and join him . the process is identical in radicalization by isis . thousands of young people across europe are at risk of being trafficked to syria for marriage and holy war . in any other situation , they would be regarded as children -- yet pin the isis label on them and the knee jerk reaction is one of condemnation . the exploitation of the politics of fear combined with tougher terror laws has created a climate of fear for muslims who are portrayed as threatening a `` civilized '' way of life . we are quick to forget recent history : the disastrous treatment of the catholic community in northern ireland produced a sense of burning injustice which acted as a recruiting sergeant for the ira for more than four decades . today , muslims are being dealt with in the same way .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the big search is over . that 's the message out of indonesia , where national search and rescue chief bambang soelistyo announced that the main search-and-recovery operation surrounding doomed commercial airliner airasia flight 8501 officially ended tuesday . `` these past two months have been the hardest times for all of us at airasia and for the families of qz8501 passengers , '' airasia indonesia ceo sunu widyatmoko said . `` no words can express how grateful we are for all the prayers , love and support given us . '' he was referring to the nightmare that the airline and , especially , the loved ones of the 162 people on board the airbus a320-200 jet have been experiencing since its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers on december 28 . indonesian transportation minister ignasius jonan later explained the plane climbed rapidly , then stalled shortly before it crashed . unlike malaysia airlines flight 370 , which disappeared a year ago and still has n't been located , there has been less mystery and more closure over flight qz8501 . that 's because searchers did find remnants from the airasia aircraft and the remains of some passengers in the java sea . that included the jetliner 's fuselage , the last major piece of which was recovered late last month and brought into a jakarta port earlier this week . as of tuesday , authorities had identified the bodies of 94 who had been on the airasia plane , with six other bodies still in surabaya 's bhayangkara hospital . yet that leaves scores of other families still waiting . the decision to call off the main search stems from the fact no more human remains were found in the past week , soelistyo explained . but that does n't mean authorities wo n't be looking at all . there will be a smaller-scale operation , involving divers and three vessels , over the next week , according to indonesia 's national search and rescue agency . after that , the plan is to call off the search entirely .
new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- a federal jury wednesday found abid naseer guilty of plotting with al qaeda to bomb a shopping center in 2009 in manchester , england , the u.s. attorney for the eastern district of new york said . naseer , 28 , was convicted on three criminal violations : providing material support to al qaeda , conspiring to provide material support for al qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence . the manchester plot was allegedly part of a three-pronged plan that included attacks on the new york city subway system and on a newsroom in copenhagen . none were carried out . the new york plot allegedly originated with najibullah zazi , who is believed to have corresponded with the same al qaeda contact as naseer . zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in naseer 's trial . naseer , a pakistani national , was in the united kingdom on a student visa at the time of his arrest . among the evidence presented , prosecutors pointed out that naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week . naseer had no intention of completing his studies because `` that was never the plan , '' assistant u.s. attorney zainab ahmad argued , saying that naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack . naseer maintained throughout the two-week trial that he was innocent , repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the united kingdom to find a wife , not to plan an attack . he represented himself . he told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence , with no witnesses offering direct information of naseer 's role in the alleged plot . they did not offer any outright proof of any link to al qaeda or any other terrorist organization , he argued . naseer 's arrest in england was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in britain . he was extradited in january 2013 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- selma , it seems , is everywhere . the ava duvernay film of that name continues to draw audiences and plaudits , while this month marks the 50th anniversary of three pivotal civil rights marches from the alabama city -- the first two stopped by brute force , the third a triumphant procession to the state capital of montgomery led by martin luther king jr. , ralph bunche , maurice davis and other activists . now , the events that seared those marches into the american consciousness are the subject of a photography show at the steven kasher gallery in new york . `` selma march 1965 '' brings together -- for the first time , anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era : james barker , spider martin and the man kasher calls `` the single greatest civil rights photographer '' -- charles moore . the pictures in the gallery above include moore 's work in selma and from other parts of the south , including some of the riveting , award-winning photos he made in birmingham , alabama , in 1963 . -lrb- two weeks after his birmingham pictures appeared in a landmark issue of life magazine , a letter to the editor succinctly captured the elemental power of moore 's work . the birmingham pictures , wrote a reader from indiana , were `` superb and bone-chilling . '' -rrb- . `` the quality , the depth , the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled , '' kasher said of moore 's civil rights shots . kasher 's own bona fides on the topic , meanwhile , are well-established : he 's mounted photography shows on the civil rights movement in 30 different public venues since the mid-1990s . `` it 's important to remember that charles was a white alabaman , '' kasher said . `` he was the photographer at the montgomery advertiser -- hardly a bastion of integration -- who became very sympathetic to the movement . i knew charles pretty well , and he had many sides to him -- sides he was able to reconcile and that allowed him to shoot with a deep understanding of so many different points of view . he was not parachuting into these marches and protests in the south . he had roots there and was fully engaged . `` of course , there are lots of really good pictures of the era by , say , bruce davidson , bob adelman and others , but they 're northerners -- and i think that shows . there 's a sense in many of the photos made in the south by northern photographers that what they were capturing was somehow exotic . for charles , this was home . '' at his very best , moore invested his pictures with an unsettling intimacy . whether he was chronicling the overt , graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet galway kinnell in selma -- moore 's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with robert capa 's famous dictum ringing in his ears : `` if your photographs are n't good enough , you 're not close enough . '' moore was always , always close enough . john loengard , who was a staff photographer at life and later the founding picture editor for people magazine and for life , the monthly , in the late '70s and '80s , calls selma `` a not particularly dramatic event , photographically . '' he does , however , have high praise for moore 's birmingham work , specifically , and his legacy in general . `` there 's no question that charlie made some phenomenal pictures , '' said loengard -- who , incidentally , took one of the most memorable photos of the civil rights era : a life cover of medgar evers ' weeping widow and son at the slain activist 's funeral in june 1963 . `` and he did a terrific job , for example , on a cover story on -lrb- alabama gov. -rrb- george wallace in the first few months of people . '' social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . whatever else moore might have shot , and however routinely excellent his output over the course of his long career , there 's little doubt he 'll always be remembered and honored for his work during those fraught years of the early and mid-1960s . `` what 's especially significant to me about charles ' civil rights work , '' kasher said , `` is his clear affinity with nonviolence at the same time that he 's depicting the irrationality and brutality of the segregationists . `` in his famous picture of a police dog attacking a black man in birmingham in ' 63 , for example , the figure in the photo is a perfect symbol of nonviolence . you know , the man is standing there , taking it , not fighting back , amid this incredible rush of hatred and violence and as another dog is charging right at moore 's -- at the viewer 's -- face . it 's a terribly complex image , swirling with information , but in the middle of it is this unmistakable emblem of the movement -- an emblem of the power and bravery of civil disobedience . '' charles moore was an american photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s . some of his photos are included in `` selma march 1965 , '' a photography show taking place at new york 's steven kasher gallery from march 5 to april 18 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the ferguson police department has demonstrated a pattern of racial discrimination , the justice department said wednesday . but while some experts say the numbers alone tell only part of the story , the 102-page report merely reaffirmed many residents ' beliefs . in ferguson , just over 67 % of residents are black . but among the findings , the report shows that 85 % of traffic stops , 90 % of citations , 93 % of arrests and 88 % of use-of-force incidents involved african-americans , the justice department said . st. louis alderman antonio french said the police department 's behavior amounted to `` taxation by citation . '' he told cnn the arrests affected not just ferguson residents but also residents of nearby communities who pass through ferguson en route to other locales in the area . justice department : no darren wilson charges . the statistics sound damning , but former los angeles police chief bernard parks , who dealt with the justice department during his five-year tenure as chief , said , `` the numbers can be deceiving because the population is overwhelmingly black . '' the numbers alone do n't paint the full picture , he said , explaining that he 'd need more than mere statistics about each stop to draw solid conclusions . read the report . parks served as chief in la from 1997 to 2002 , and after the justice department determined in 2000 that the lapd had engaged `` in a pattern or practice of excessive force , false arrests and unreasonable searches and seizures , '' he had to overhaul the department , combating corruption and even jailing former police officers . based on that experience , parks said the report released wednesday should n't be taken at face value , but rather should be used to help determine `` what is really going on in ferguson and what to do to correct it . '' politics may even be at play , los angeles-based community activist joe hicks suggested . attorney general eric holder wanted to bring civil rights cases against ferguson officer darren wilson , who killed michael brown in august , and florida neighborhood watch volunteer george zimmerman , who killed trayvon martin in 2012 -- but neither case panned out . the report may be holder 's way to `` extract a pound of flesh , if you will , from the ferguson police department . '' -lrb- also wednesday , the justice department closed its investigation into wilson , declining to bring criminal charges against him . -rrb- . still , the report likely did n't surprise some residents who spoke to cnn in august , during the height of the protests . patricia pendelton , 41 , a nurse who lives a few blocks from where brown took his last steps , said older and female african-american residents are n't affected as much , but her sons -- ages 17 , 19 and 21 -- have had different experiences . they and other young black men have been stopped for reasons as spurious as looking suspicious , she said . `` how does a person look suspicious ? what do you have to be wearing to look suspicious ? '' she asked before mimicking an offending police officer 's questions : '' ` where you going ? what you doing ? how you doing it ? ' it 's none of your business . '' outside his bustling barbershop , mike knox recalled how one of his sons , an a student , was arrested with several other kids in the parking lot of an auto parts store . they 'd met there because it was a central location to rendezvous before a game of basketball . when knox , 33 , picked his son up , police told him he had n't been charged , just taken away by police , he said . the father of four said he himself had been pulled over for dwb , or `` driving while black , '' a common complaint among african-americans in ferguson . maurice phipps , 22 , a ferguson resident of eight years , relayed a similar story : a ferguson officer once pulled him over and said he was looking for a suspect with dreadlocks . `` and i got a box cut , '' he said , pointing to his dyed-blond ` do . being a lifelong resident of the st. louis area , knox knows ferguson well . when he was a kid , st. louis police walked the streets and handed kids cardinals baseball cards , so he 's seen real community-oriented policing . but there 's a rift between the community and police in ferguson -- as well as in surrounding areas such as hazelwood and florissant , he said . `` they all do it . people are just tired of that happening . why should we get pulled over every time we get in the car ? '' he said , adding that he struggles with what to tell his kids . `` you do n't want to tell them the police are bad . i tell them , ` keep it moving , ' '' he said . `` if you let your attitude take over , that can be you laying on that ground . '' even white residents have complained of run-ins with police . tom steigerwald , 31 , who has lived in ferguson since 1994 , said ferguson has always been a diverse town , and race is n't much of a factor among residents . `` it 's always diverse , but they always got along , '' he said . but the police ? `` they all got a power trip problem , a lot of them , '' he said . following wednesday 's announcement , michael brown 's parents , lesley mcspadden and michael brown sr. , released a statement saying they were disappointed that wilson would not face federal charges in their son 's death . but the report on the police department could provide a silver lining . `` we are encouraged that the doj will hold the ferguson police department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color , '' the statement said . `` it is our hope that through this action , true change will come not only in ferguson , but around the country . if that change happens , our son 's death will not have been in vain . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- new figures indicate that about 11 million people have signed up for health insurance during this latest sign-up period of obamacare , of which about half will be from the uninsured population , based on previous estimates . once again , the supporters of the law celebrate with proclamations that `` it 's working . '' one could say that assessment is true , if the definition of `` working '' means enrolling people into anything called health insurance . to be sure , the law 's implementation is progressing , but there is no cause for celebration . it is indeed true that millions of americans are now newly enrolled into health insurance , but it is disingenuous to tout this as a great success . an estimated 71 % of the new insurance arises through medicaid , using 2014 calculations based on analysis by haislmaier and gonshorowski of data from the centers for medicaid and medicare . the harsh reality awaiting these low-income americans is undeniable : according to 2013 data from a 2014 merritt hawkins study , 55 % of doctors already refuse new medicaid patients . according to the hsc health tracking physician survey , 2008 , the percentage of doctors that refuse new medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients . such `` insurance '' from obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors , but research in the top medical journals such as cancer , american journal of cardiology , journal of heart and lung transplantation and annals of surgery , show that medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance ... all at an added cost of another $ 800 billion by cbo estimates to taxpayers after the decade . it is not hyperbole to call medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $ 450 billion , and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable . health care access for middle-class americans is also significantly worsened by obamacare 's private insurance decrees . the law already forced termination of health insurance for millions of americans estimated as 4.7 million by the associated press -- insurance they personally had chosen to buy . the congressional budget office now projects that a stunning 10 million americans will be forced off their chosen employer-based health insurance by 2021 -- a tenfold increase in the number that was initially projected back in 2011 , at the onset of the law . along with that forced change of coverage , many suddenly find themselves without access to their chosen doctors . despite the assertion that the law increases insurance choices , the obamacare exchanges do quite the opposite for those dependent on them and their government 's subsidies . mckinsey reported 68 % of obamacare insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks , double that of the previous year . for cancer care , the majority of america 's best hospitals in the national comprehensive cancer network are not covered in most of their states ' exchange plans . the `` narrow network '' strategy is about to hit even more americans in 2015 , as obamacare exchanges from california to new hampshire further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself , according to an analysis by the los angeles times . and a study in late 2014 commissioned by the prestigious american heart association determined that the specialists essential to diagnose and treat stroke , one of the most disabling and lethal diseases in the united states , are in severe shortage under obamacare insurance exchange plans . indeed , unless one has the financial resources or power to skirt the new system , many of america 's top doctors and hospitals are no longer available . obamacare has forced americans onto a far more government-dominated health care pathway than in the past . coupled with population aging , the 107 million under the government 's medicaid or medicare insurance in 2013 will rapidly increase to 135 million just five years later , a growth rate tripling that of private insurance . by the end of the decade , a full 140 million americans will have their health care access directly controlled by government insurance , according to the centers for medicare and medicaid . more doctors than ever already refuse medicaid and medicare due to inadequate payments for care , and that will only accelerate as government lowers reimbursements . less appreciated is that inadequate payments to doctors by government insurance substantially increase private insurance premiums . back in 2008 , a shortfall of over $ 88 billion of payment from medicaid and medicare beneficiaries added more than $ 1,500 extra per year in premiums and $ 1,800 extra in total out-of-pocket costs to every family of four with private insurance . as the government increases its role as insurer , it increases its hold on payments to doctors and hospitals , so it will be able to reduce reimbursements and dictate access to limited networks of doctors and hospitals . and with increasing enrollment into government insurance , private premiums will undoubtedly rise even more . it is therefore absolutely critical for the new congress to reject obamacare and instead help individual americans and their families , particularly middle class and poor americans -- the people most harmed by obamacare . any legitimate health reform plan must be focused on three goals : 1 -rrb- help consumers find affordable private insurance suited to their personal needs ; 2 -rrb- liberate the poor from medicaid so they have actual access to medical care , as well as the dignity of personal choice of doctor ; and 3 -rrb- add substantive mechanisms that reduce health care costs by competition and value-seeking by consumers . the plan should not replicate the false claims of obamacare supporters that recent slowdowns in health spending from economic downturns were somehow caused by obamacare . the patient choice , affordability , responsibility , and empowerment -lrb- patientcare -rrb- act put forth this month by leading republicans in congress tries to do just that . this bill , also known as coburn-burr-hatch , represents a serious plan to expand access to health care and reduce the nation 's health care expenses . the coburn-burr-hatch proposal incentivizes people to buy insurance they value , and it generates affordable options , instead of forcing the purchase of expensive insurance that individuals do n't want . current harmful barriers to interstate cooperation and anti-competitive impediments are reduced . health savings plans are liberalized to allow everyone , not just the affluent , control over their health care dollar . medicaid reforms provide options for individuals to buy private coverage , and the government provides significant financial support for lower income americans . and no one is forced to spend their hard-earned money on something they do not want . as the supreme court hears arguments wednesday about the legitimacy of subsidies under the aca , americans must recognize the bigger picture about u.s. health reform . contrary to the mantra that the gop has no plan other than to repeal obamacare , the truth is that it is the supporters of obamacare are the ones who are single-minded . they are focused on maintaining the aca without regard for legitimate reforms to improve health care access and quality and without finally addressing what always was the most important problem with us health care -- its cost . responsible leadership must focus on empowering patients instead of the government , before private health insurance and with that access to the excellence of america 's medical system are eliminated for all but the affluent . empowering individuals -- regardless of socioeconomic status -- with choices and information in order to facilitate access to care from the best doctors and hospitals in the world should be the thrust of any change to american health care . that 's an american solution , and it 's up to our elected officials to make sure it finally happens .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- when food giant nestle usa -lrb- to which i am , alas , not related -rrb- last month announced plans to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate candies , it understandably made headlines . according to the company , by the end of 2015 , none of a group of 250 chocolate products including butterfinger and baby ruth will contain artificial flavors or colors such as red # 40 or yellow # 5 . with the expectation that these chemicals will also disappear from the company 's other candies , it looks like the end of the use of artificial flavors and colors in anything but the cheapest food products . if that proves to be the case , it will be a welcome shift . nestle usa intends to advertise the reformulated products with a `` no artificial flavors or colors '' claim on package labels . if sales of the `` no artificial '' candies grow as expected , the company will surely extend the removal to all of its other colored and flavored food products . after all , nestle 's international parent company -- and the company 's competitors -- will have to take notice and find ways to remove these chemicals from all their product lines . nestle usa has undeniable clout . it accounts for a quarter of the $ 100 billion in annual revenues of the more than century-old , privately held parent corporation , which itself is the largest food company in the world . this move surely will not only reverberate through the candy industry , but also affect every other major food company . in substituting natural for artificial flavors and colors , nestle usa is responding to what its customers are saying . the company 's own research indicates that americans prefer their beloved candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors , while other surveys find majorities of respondents saying that artificial chemical additives negatively influence their buying decisions . 7 chemicals in your food . nestle is also responding to decades of complaints from consumer advocates about the potential health risks of these chemicals , especially the dyes . studies in experimental animals have linked high doses of food dyes to health problems , among them organ damage , cancer , birth defects , and allergic reactions . in humans , studies link food dyes to hyperactivity and other behavioral problems in young children . the credibility of these studies and their implications for human health remain hotly debated . in the 1970s , for example , ben feingold , a physician in california , suggested that food additives caused children to become hyperactive . much of the evidence for the `` feingold hypothesis '' rested on anecdotal reports by parents , whereas double-blind , controlled clinical trials produced contradictory results . on the basis of current evidence , some artificial food dyes have been banned , while others remain in use despite suggestions that they too might be harmful . but the makers and users of food dyes argue that the chemicals are safe at current levels of usage . as a result of all this , and in the absence of convincing evidence of their safety , the advocacy group center for science in the public interest has campaigned since the 1970s to remove food dyes and other chemicals from foods , and has continued to petition the food and drug administration to ban them . kraft removing artificial dyes from some mac and cheese . the opposing views complicate the regulatory status of food dyes . but after one clinical trial reported that dyes induce hyperactivity in half the children studied , the british government asked companies to stop using most food colors ; the european union requires a warning notice on many foods made with them . in the united states , the fda does not permit artificial food dyes to be used unless the manufacturers can meet safety requirements . but the amounts of these substances in the country 's food supply have greatly increased in recent years -- soft drinks , breakfast cereals , frozen desserts and even salad dressings all contain artificial coloring agents . true , the fda considers a dye to be safe if there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from its intended use . but that standard is vague enough to cause concern . given the unresolved scientific questions , it is reasonable to ask why artificial colors have to be in foods at all . from the standpoint of manufacturers , such additives are essential for covering up and hiding unattractive colors in processed foods . to the public , red candy seems to taste better than the drab variety . and while natural colors exist , they are less stable or more expensive to produce . but for nestle to have taken the action that it has , the company must have found substitutes it can live with . and appealing to consumers ' preference for `` natural '' makes good business sense . the truth is that whether artificial colors do or do not cause health problems in adults or children , they are there strictly for cosmetic purposes . for that reason alone , getting rid of them is a good idea .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i am a friendly , hard-working ohio native . it 's how a lot of my friends in new york describe midwesterners . it 's as if we 're assembled at `` the flyover wonder bread factory , '' devoid of color or depth . we supposedly represent all that is wholesome in america . that may be true , but `` friendly and hard-working '' is so ... bland . if you think i 'm being a tad harsh , ask anyone who is n't from the midwest to describe someone born and raised in america 's heartland . my favorite definition came from a colleague raised in florida . she struggled to describe us at first , then said , `` simple . '' um , like the amish ? `` no , '' she said , flustered . even my fellow midwesterners have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors . cnn legal analyst danny cevallos is a proud native of north muskegon , michigan . first thing out of his mouth , `` friendliness ! '' after that , he struggled , too . `` boy , let me see ... um ... not easily agitated ? '' i rolled my eyes . `` that is so bland , danny . '' he paused , then said , `` i 'll take bland over the rap florida gets any day . '' even my new friend , jared zak , from wisconsin struggled . the best he could come up with was `` hearty . '' i asked these questions after interviewing eric dayton , who wants his native minnesota to divorce itself from the midwest . `` we 're midwest if you 're looking at it from new york city or from anywhere on -lsb- the east -rsb- coast , '' dayton told me . `` but then again , that 's someone else 's definition . i think it 's time for us to claim our own . '' dayton and his brother , andrew , whose father is the state 's governor , are minneapolis businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor . eric dayton , after touring scandinavia -lrb- many minnesotans are of norwegian descent -rrb- , became enthralled by the region 's strong identity . it proudly embraced its chilly weather , its food , its culture , its ... northiness . so why , he questioned , did n't minnesota ? when dayton got home he hired a minnesota company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said , `` north . '' they sold out and dayton 's idea headed , well , north . minnesotans just got it , he said . i admit , i did n't get it , until i thought more about it . minnesota -- or should i say minneapolis -- is criticized , by some of my compatriots , for being `` minnesota nice , '' the sort of `` nice '' -lrb- fake -rrb- that is n't remotely the kind of `` nice '' -lrb- sincere -rrb- for which midwesterners are renowned . but , hey , i have an open mind . you could argue that minnesota , along with north dakota , parts of illinois , indiana , wisconsin and michigan , are in the northern region of the united states . and , you could argue ohio , pennsylvania and west virginia are eastern states . the only truly midwestern states are illinois , missouri , iowa , kansas , nebraska and south dakota . go ahead , argue among yourselves , but know that mr. dayton is n't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling minnesota -- `` the north . '' he 's talking about image and , although he wo n't say it , branding . `` the new york times had done an article highlighting different thanksgiving side dishes , '' dayton told me . `` for minnesota , they named grape salad as our signature side dish . and no one in minnesota had ever heard of grape salad ... it was kind of a harmless example , but if we do n't tell the rest of the country who we are , we end up with grape salad . '' that story got under my skin , especially when i looked up the nyt idea of ohio 's signature side dish : english pea and onion salad . it gets worse . the times extolled the salad 's `` deliciousness '' by saying it `` calls to mind the processed-food delights that , for decades , characterized the cooking of the midwest . '' seriously ? the new york times is n't solely to blame for the midwest 's image problem . politicians are , too . andrew cayton is a distinguished professor of history at miami university in ohio . he wrote a book called `` the identity of the american midwest : essays on regional history . '' `` the midwest , '' he told me , `` has always been a dynamic and diverse place , but that image does n't fit with what people want to believe . '' and , by people , cayton means politicians who routinely use the midwest as code for a place in time that never actually existed : crime-free and populated with hard-working people who all look and worship the same . `` arguing about the midwest , '' cayton says , `` has become arguing about america as a whole . '' so , listen up , campaigning politicians ! stop trying to bond with the midwest with your bowling prowess -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- and for goodness ' sake , stop eating corn dogs at state fairs . and while i 'm at it , political reporters , please stop interviewing voters in diners ! i 'm not maligning bowling -lrb- my dad , tony , is in the amateur bowling hall of fame -rrb- or corn dogs , but those things do n't represent the modern midwest . it is so much more dynamic and , yes , diverse . chicago is not like detroit . st. louis is not like pittsburgh . indianapolis is not like columbus , or dayton or cleveland or cincinnati . and , minneapolis is not like any of them , either . minnesota boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold-weather sports , such as pond hockey . yet , i 'm from canton , ohio , and i have never touched a hockey stick -lrb- although those other `` northern '' states certainly have excellent puck-handling abilities -rrb- . minneapolis also has a thriving cultural community , is home to 19 fortune 500 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods . and , at the moment -- it has what many polite midwesterners ca n't abide by -- attitude . you know , minnesota nice . definition ? as my pal from wisconsin puts it , `` sarcastic , pretentious and exclusionary . '' `` i know . arrogant minnesota , '' dayton joked . `` that 's what everyone thinks of when they think of minnesota . right ? no , again , this is n't about being better . it 's not a relative thing . it 's just i think there are a lot of great things happening in minnesota . it 's not being recognized . i think it 's important for the reasons we 've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer . and so it 's just putting forth our story . it 's not trying to make it look better than it is . it 's not comparing ourselves to anyone else . '' i do n't know if dayton will be successful , but i do understand why he wants minnesota to define minnesota . you do n't attract the best and the brightest with `` friendly . '' `` there is a competition for talent , '' dayton said . `` and it 's a national competition , even an international competition . '' maybe ohio should join the rebranding club and become `` the east . '' 'cause you know what ? i may be friendly and hard-working , but i 'm not simple . so stop asking me if i 've ever gone `` cow tipping . '' or i just might go all minnesota on you .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. navy does n't just do stuff `` for fun , '' says the command master chief of the aircraft carrier uss ronald reagan , but what 30 % of the ship 's crew will be up to over the next year or so can at least be termed pretty cool . and it will certainly be unprecedented . some 1,200 of the reagan 's crew will be executing what the navy calls a three-hull swap , serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty as the service juggles assets to meet mission requirements . the 1,200 are calling themselves `` the three presidents crew , '' as they will serve aboard three of the navy 's carriers named after presidents : the reagan , the uss george washington and the uss theodore roosevelt . the crew will even have its own insignia and hull number , cvn 220 , the sum of the hull numbers of the reagan -lrb- cvn 76 -rrb- , the roosevelt -lrb- cvn 71 -rrb- and the washington -lrb- cvn 73 -rrb- . mass communication specialist 3rd class david frederick aboard the reagan came up with the logo . `` i am honored that my art will be a part of the legacy of this ` three presidents ' crew , and i hope that it will bring attention to the hard work of all the sailors who are involved in this crew swap , '' he said . the swap will begin this summer . the george washington will go from its home port in japan to san diego , where a crew swap with the reagan will take place . while the george washington crew takes the reagan to replace the washington in japan , the three presidents crew will board the george washington , which will be headed for norfolk , virginia , and an overhaul . the 1,200 will sail with the washington around south america , then they will fly back to san diego to crew the roosevelt , which is taking the reagan 's current spot there . `` think of how difficult a three-hull carrier swap would be to carry out , '' capt. chris bolt , the commander of the reagan , said in the ship 's publication , the 76er . `` it 's never been done before . '' `` we are just moving assets around so we can continue to meet mission requirements . that 's exactly what this is all about . it 's not because the navy said , ` let 's do this for fun , ' '' spike call , command master chief of the reagan , said in the 76er . seven of the navy 's 10 active aircraft carriers are named after presidents . as one commenter on the reagan 's facebook page said , maybe next time , the navy could add a fourth carrier to the hull swap and come up with ... the uss mount rushmore . hmmm , the navy does have the uss abraham lincoln -lrb- cvn 72 -rrb- , but there is no carrier for jefferson . so say we sub in the reagan and come up with cvn 292 . apologies to the uss rushmore -lrb- lsd 47 -rrb- .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in september 2002 , then-former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu told a u.s. congressional committee `` there is absolutely no question whatsoever '' that saddam hussein 's iraq was developing nuclear weapons at `` portable manufacturing sites of mass death . '' once hussein had nuclear weapons , netanyahu warned , `` the terror network will have nuclear weapons , '' placing `` the security of the entire world at risk . '' fast forward to this week , and netanyahu was back , this time as prime minister , to make virtually identical claims about iran . yet not only has the u.s. intelligence community disagreed with netanyahu 's assessment of iranian nuclear intentions , so does israel 's , according to leaked documents . indeed , more than 200 retired security officers have publicly criticized netanyahu as a danger to israel 's security . sadly , netanyahu 's presentation reinforces caricatures regularly advanced by american and gulf arab pundits -- caricatures of iran as aspiring middle eastern hegemon , bent on overthrowing an otherwise stable regional order . it 's a misguided perspective that is actually hurting the united states . in netanyahu 's view , america should only improve relations with an iran that stops its regional `` aggression , '' its support for `` terrorism , '' and its `` threat -lsb- s -rsb- to annihilate ... israel . '' in other words , america should not improve relations with an iran whose regional influence is rising . in reality , iran 's rise is not only normal , it is actually essential to a more stable region . as nuclear talks with tehran enter a decisive phase , rapprochement with a genuinely independent iran -- not a nominally independent iran whose strategic orientation is subordinated to u.s. preferences -- is vital to halting the decline of america 's strategic position . washington has long worked to consolidate a highly militarized , pro-american middle eastern order . yet these efforts -- pursued across democratic and republican administrations and intensified after 9/11 -- have clearly failed . as a result , the middle east today is less stable , more riven with sectarian and ethnic conflict , and more violent than at any point in its modern history . and america , in a textbook illustration of `` imperial overstretch , '' has made itself weaker , both regionally and globally . america 's quest for middle eastern hegemony has failed for many reasons . for a start , seeking dominance impels washington to replicate , in multiple venues , its faustian bargain with imperial iran from 1953 until the last shah 's overthrow in 1979 , providing substantial and effectively open-ended support to governments acting against the desires of their own publics . while american elites argue that america benefits from such arrangements , they are ultimately unsustainable , as iran 's 1979 revolution demonstrated . a determination to dominate the middle east keeps locking washington into these kinds of relationships ; for its own sake , the united states needs to stop trying to be the middle east 's hegemon . that means embracing a regional balance of power -- not the chimera of american dominance misleadingly labeled as `` balance , '' but an actual balance in which major regional states , acting in their own interests , constrain one another . under any political system , iran would be a significant regional actor , due to its geostrategic location , hydrocarbon resources , and large , educated population . but the islamic republic -- which iranians built themselves as a participatory islamist system representing their interests , not those of rulers beholden to foreign powers -- has a legitimacy america must accept to foster a truly stable middle east . iran has gained influence in iraq , lebanon , afghanistan , syria and yemen by backing political structures that , in tehran 's judgment , will produce governments committed to foreign policy independence . washington needs cooperation with just such an iran against common foes like the islamic state of iraq and syria , and to balance counterproductive policies of america 's regional allies . washington 's self-damaging drive for middle eastern hegemony is inextricably linked to its unconditional support for an increasingly extreme and unrepresentative israel . a myth prevails that america 's bond with israel flows from `` shared democratic values '' and response to the holocaust . in fact , washington only started providing israel with significant military assistance and diplomatic impunity after the 1967 war , when israel seized pivotal territory from egypt and syria , two soviet allies opposed to american regional dominance . for the remainder of and after the cold war , u.s. officials calculated that ensuring israel 's military superiority over its neighbors helped america pursue hegemony over the middle east , even as occupying millions more palestinians clearly made israel less democratic . -lrb- the u.s. government 's own demographic data show that the number of arabs under israeli control -- in `` green line '' israel , gaza , the golan heights , east jerusalem and the west bank -- exceeds that of israeli jews , making the israeli state a minority regime for the people it governs -rrb- . a state representing all these people would not occupy arab populations or seek ever greater freedom of military initiative in its neighborhood . israel 's pursuit of these policies -- facilitated by u.s. guarantees of its `` qualitative military edge '' -- conditions washington 's commitment to keeping over 100 million arabs under u.s.-backed autocracies and puts america on a war footing with an iran unwilling to join this inherently unstable regional order . the reality is that israel 's concern about iranian nuclearization is not that tehran will use -lrb- at the moment nonexistent -rrb- nuclear weapons against a nuclear-armed israel . instead , as then-defense minister ehud barak explained in 2012 , it is that a nuclear iran would `` restrict our range of operations . '' but this is precisely what a truly stable balance of power requires . america needs constructive relations with all major regional states , including iran , so that they constrain one another 's reckless impulses .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- gold bars . each weighed between 25 and 27 pounds , together about 275 pounds . the bars ' total weight in gold is worth about $ 4.8 million . that much adds up . but what about the story of how they got swiped on sunday from a truck alongside interstate 95 in north carolina ? investigators are trying to figure that out , including how two armed security guards could have been so quickly pounced upon , bound and then robbed so soon after pulling over in wilson county , as they 've told authorities . `` there 's suspicion about everything going on in this case , '' wilson county sheriff calvin woodard jr. said wednesday in a news conference about the case . he also released composite sketches of two of the three suspects , one of whom he described as a heavyset hispanic male with a cuban accent and the other as a dark-skinned hispanic male with a white mustache and goatee who was dressed in black . he showed reporters a photo of the white van they allegedly got away in , as well as an image of the traffic cones they used -- which came from a florida company that does n't do business in north carolina . what he could n't say definitively was whether these men had some help . there are a lot of questions , in fact , that ca n't be answered . authorities say the initial statements from the two guards who work for transvalue inc. , a florida-based company that transports valuables , were a bit confusing due to the guards ' spotty english , though woodward said police now have a clearer picture after bringing in spanish-speakers to translate . these two men , both of whom have worked for transvalue for several years , set off early sunday morning from miami with a truck full of gold protected by a padlock and presumably their firearms . they were headed for bridgewater , massachusetts , `` to a place ... where they handled such things , '' woodard explained . they stopped to get gas in dillon , south carolina , then hit the interstate once again . the guards later told police they smelled gas , with one of them getting sick . so they pulled over . that leads to the first big question about the men 's story : did something happen to their vehicle to cause the gas smell ? not according to a wilson county mechanic , who `` did not determine any type of issues '' with the truck , according to woodard . so the sicker guard gets out of the vehicle . he says he 's quickly met by two suspects , who yell out , `` policia , policia . '' they ask him to go to the ground then tie him up with three zip ties , according to woodard . after this , the other guard gets out of the vehicle . he encounters the same men -- one of them wearing a red traffic vest -- who repeat that they are police . he says that he , too , eventually gets to the ground and is bound with duck tape . but were n't these armed guards ? yes and no . neither man had a gun on them when they exited their vehicle , violating their company 's protocol , the sheriff said . and did anyone see them get bound and led into the nearby woods ? no , at least no one who has contacted police . but people called authorities around 6:49 p.m. sunday after they spotted the men , still bound , coming out of the woods , according to woodard . by then , the $ 4.8 million in gold and the three men suspected of taking it were gone . that 's left authorities trying to track those valuables down and piece together exactly what happened . investigators have already gone to south carolina , and they 're getting help from the fbi . they 're all working to get information out of places between florida and north carolina , to try to corroborate the guards ' stories and uncover any evidence that might identify the suspected thieves . woodard says transvalue has been `` very cooperative '' in the investigation , as have the company 's two guards . neither was injured beyond some scratches on their legs from going into the woods . `` right now , -lrb- the guards -rrb- are still considered victims , '' woodard said , declining to answer whether or not authorities believe this was an inside job . '' ... but we 're investigating every avenue . ''
baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- iraqi forces appeared wednesday to be making progress on the third day of a major offensive intended to push isis fighters out of the city of tikrit . the iraqi soldiers are reportedly approaching the city from five directions , as they seek to prevent isis militants from either escaping from tikrit or sending in reinforcements to bolster its defense . the operation is part of a wide-scale offensive to retake tikrit and salahuddin province ordered by iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi on sunday . it has highlighted the role played by neighboring iran in the fight against isis , at a time when the united states and five other world powers are negotiating with tehran on a controversial deal to curb its nuclear program . the semiofficial iranian fars news agency reports that qassim sulaimani , the commander of the elite iranian al-quds brigade , is helping oversee the operation to retake tikrit . iran has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraqi government . according to the pentagon , there may be iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well . despite the reported iranian assistance , the iraqi forces face no easy task as they seek to advance on tikrit . besides the direct threat posed by isis fighters , they must also avoid the large numbers of homemade bombs that litter the approaches to the city . iraq has not asked the u.s.-led coalition against isis to provide air cover for the operation to retake tikrit . isis released a number of propaganda images wednesday , showing several vehicles and dozens of isis militants with their weapons , which it said were part of a military reinforcement of salahuddin province . cnn can not independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs . how the u.s. and iran found common interests . why battle for tikrit will defeat isis . tikrit fell to isis in june of 2014 , after the group 's capture of iraq 's second-largest city , mosul . tikrit is best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . isis , the radical sunni militant group , has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of iraq and syria . on monday , iraqi forces approached tikrit from several fronts , iraqiya tv reported , engaging with isis north of the city at al-alam and south of the city at al-dour . the element of surprise probably was not a factor , as reports of iraqi troops amassing near tikrit were widely shared . what awaits the iraqi army is most likely a long , hard slog and not a quick rout . tikrit is a big city , and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from isis . there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014 . while iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area , it has generally been under isis control for the last eight months or so . prime minister al-abadi , who is also commander in chief of the armed forces , said on twitter that he would `` oversee the operation to liberate tikrit '' from isis . the joint iraqi forces fighting to retake tikrit include iraqi troops , members of the shia al-hashed al-shaabi militia , members of the sunni sons of salahuddin brigades and other sunni tribal fighters . the offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all . rights group human rights watch on wednesday urged government forces to protect civilians from revenge attacks by pro-government militias as they fight to retake tikrit . the rights group said it had documented `` numerous atrocities against sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces '' after they recaptured other towns . human rights watch also warned that isis could seek to use civilians as human shields . `` all commanders in tikrit need to make sure that their forces protect civilians and allow them to flee the combat zone , '' said joe stork , the group 's deputy middle east and north africa director . `` past fighting raises grave concerns that tikrit 's civilians are at serious risk from both isis and government forces , and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- modern women are suffering from an energy crisis . competing in the workplace , caring for aging parents and trying teenagers , and busier than ever , we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together : comfort foods , alcohol , energy drinks , and an expanding array of antidepressants , anti-anxiety meds , painkillers and amphetamines . all in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace . welcome to the increasingly altered states of america . americans are about 5 % of the world 's population , yet we take half its pills , and 80 % of its painkillers.this over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting , according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager , medco . this is creating a `` new normal , '' bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance . like steroids in baseball , when everyone starts doing it , the players who do n't are at a disadvantage . the overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology , and it 's like cosmetic surgery : as more women get breast implants , the rest of us feel flat chested . but the new normal is n't normal at all . certain antidepressants called ssris -lrb- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors -rrb- create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin , the brain chemical that helps regulate mood , which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity , while higher doses can engender apathy . women are naturally moody . our moods change , and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient . we are dynamic and responsive to our environment . there is a biological advantage to this sensitivity ; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need , what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings . moodiness -- being sensitive , caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power . it helps to ensure not only our survival , but that of our offspring . women 's emotionality is a sign of health , not disease , and it is our single biggest psychological asset . yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away . the pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising . nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from `` should i take an antidepressant ? '' to `` which one should i take ? '' these medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize , blunting empathy , passion , and sensitivity . ssris dampen sexual desire and response , making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners . ssris also make it hard to cry , an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong . tears , and the emotions beneath them , can offer a profound lesson in how people 's behavior affects others . we cry when we 're touched by the poignancy of humanity , or when we 're angry , or frustrated by injustice . and yet , women apologize for their tears , especially in the workplace , where we 've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion ; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum , and it makes people uncomfortable . the problem with shutting it down is that we 're stifling a piece that we need , that our partners and families need , and that society needs , particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government . the world needs more compassion , sensitivity , intuition and empathy . war , rape , murder , and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence . change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong . sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated . anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions , from their repression . my patients want to feel better , but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling . the shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women , who , by their biology , are the last and much needed connection to this natural place . as we embrace new technologies , we need to be careful that we do n't go too far away from nature and what 's natural for us as social primates . we insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners . why do n't we insist on natural moods for ourselves ? if we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us , we will be calmer , more at peace and more fulfilled . but we are drowning in artificiality . there is a `` plastic vortex '' of garbage the size of texas floating in the pacific ocean , synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces , virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants . we compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction , because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough . we need a course correction , away from the synthetic , so that we can live lives that honor how we feel . but to do that , we must be able to feel , to be our moody , authentic selves . that is the first step to wellness and to wholeness . medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken , but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic , making it impossible to address the causes of your pain . do n't put the alarm on mute .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- early thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake ferguson , missouri -- two police officers were shot . such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated . but the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department . and the resignation of the police chief this week wo n't be enough to restore faith in law and order . everyone in the department needs to step down so the department can be rebuilt from the ground up . it is easy to see why . after a police officer shot michael brown , the u.s. department of justice conducted an investigation into the ferguson police department . what investigators found was a `` pattern and practice '' of discrimination against african-americans . in a town with a black population of 67 % , black people represented 85 % of vehicle searches , 90 % of the traffic violations and 93 % of the arrests . there is no way to justify this . now , the department of justice has an opportunity to gut the ferguson police department and rebuild it from scratch . in fact , it 's more than an opportunity : it 's a necessity . in the court of law , there is an old closing argument that goes like this : you sit down , pour yourself a bowl of stew and find that the first piece of meat that you taste is rancid . you do n't put just that piece aside ; you throw out the whole bowl . lawyers use this story to say that if you catch a witness lying about one thing , then you ca n't believe anything they say . unfortunately , it is an analogy that can be applied to the ferguson police department . the department of justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department can not be ignored , and the problems it reveals can not be fixed from the inside . if there are a few good cops in the ferguson police department , they need to leave , and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization . in fact , everyone in the ferguson police department needs to leave , from the top to the bottom . the police department should be completely reconstituted under department of justice control in a manner that ensures that citizens of ferguson receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly , in a manner that protects their rights , not only as citizens of ferguson , missouri , but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country . a completely rebuilt ferguson police department , established with a charter to enforce the law with equality , could serve as an example for every law enforcement agency in the country . a new ferguson police department could show what a concerted , roots-up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be . under justice department leadership , the ferguson police department could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras , community policing and better use of force training . if we can create from the ashes of the ferguson police department a model that works , it may provide some consolation for minorities who have been disproportionately targeted by law enforcement . and if the black community in ferguson -- in fact , people of every race in ferguson -- can look back five years from now and see an unbiased organization of public servants who give respect and get respect , who reduce fear rather than cause it , then perhaps the tragedy of michael brown 's death will stand for something .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the reputed leader of one of mexico 's most ruthless cartels walked with his head bowed wednesday as federal forces escorted him into an armored vehicle in the country 's capital . authorities closed in on zetas boss omar trevino morales in predawn darkness , capturing him in an operation without firing a single shot , said monte alejandro rubido , head of mexico 's national security council . there are 11 pending criminal cases against him , and the crimes trevino is accused of committing make him `` one of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminals in mexico , '' said tomas zeron , director of criminal investigations for the attorney general 's office . speaking later in the day to reporters at mexico city 's airport , zeron said the drug kingpin 's legal situation would be assessed after he makes a statement to investigators . u.s. officials have requested his extradition , zeron said . known as `` z-42 , '' trevino was arrested at about 3 a.m. in san pedro garza garcia , a suburb of the industrial hub of monterrey . in a simultaneous operation , five others were arrested , including the cartel 's suspected financial operator , rubido said . for the mexican government , trevino 's arrest marks the second high-level capture of a purported drug boss in a week . servando gomez , leader of the knights templar drug cartel , was captured friday in the state of michoacan . the capture of the cartel leaders is a victory for president enrique peña nieto , though the zetas and knights templar are not as powerful as they once were . still , reports of violence , corruption and extortion continue to flow from the areas of northern mexico where the zetas operate . the u.s. state department was offering a reward of $ 5 million for information leading to the arrest of trevino morales . the mexican government offered an additional $ 2 million . trevino morales is believed to have been at the helm of the zetas since 2013 , inheriting the post from his brother , miguel angel trevino morales . miguel angel , or `` z-40 , '' was known as a ruthless drug lord with a reputation for burning his enemies alive and ordering mass killings . his arrest in july 2013 was praised as a turning point . but while certain cartels have been weakened after their leaders are captured , critics are quick to point out that the criminal organizations survive , and new leaders rise . the u.s. drug enforcement administration praised mexico 's government for arresting trevino , saying he facilitated and oversaw `` huge drug shipments into the united states and elsewhere . '' he faces federal drug trafficking conspiracy and money laundering charges in several jurisdictions , including washington , d.c. and south texas . `` the zetas represent the worst in global organized crime : violence , intimidation , corruption , and brutal killings , '' dea administrator michele m. leonhart said in a statement . `` today 's arrest strikes at the heart of the leadership structure of the zetas and should serve as yet another warning that no criminal is immune from arrest and prosecution .

'' `` we abhor drug crime , but we abhor the death penalty . we think that these two australians deserve to be punished , but they certainly do n't deserve to be executed , '' he said . the prime minister said people should not let anger affect australians ' relationship with indonesia . the two men will be given 72 hours notice of their impending appointment with a 12-member firing squad once they arrive on the island of nusakambangan . but precisely when is unclear . they are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution . the bali nine were arrested after indonesian police received a tip from australian federal police . chan , 31 , was called the ringleader of the plot , and sukumaran was described as chan 's collaborator in the scheme . seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences . police caught four people at the denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies . another four -- including sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of kuta . chan was detained after a boarding a plane to sydney -- he was n't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot . the indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two australians against president joko widodo . the attorneys wanted a review of the president 's decision to deny them clemency . todung mulya lubis , who represents the pair , said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons . `` there should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on , '' lubis said . sukumaran and chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars , according to fellow inmates and the jail 's chief warden . sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates . chan has found spirituality , which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems . their rehabilitation is genuine , australian foreign minister julie bishop has said . `` andrew and myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve , '' bishop told the australian parliament in february . indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers , and widodo has made it clear he does n't intend to introduce a policy of leniency . in december , six prisoners were killed by firing squad , including five foreigners from brazil , the netherlands , malawi , nigeria and vietnam . brazilian president dilma rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had `` severely affected '' relations with indonesia . cnn 's camille feanny and jennifer deaton contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a court in turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting turkish president recep tayyip erdogan . soon after , the court changed the jail sentence to a fine of 7,000 turkish lira or about $ 2,700 each . cartoonists bahadir baruter and ozer aydogan draw for the weekly satirical magazine penguen . founded in 2002 with a weekly average of 65,000 readers , the irreverent comic book -- similar in many ways to the french magazine charlie hebdo -- regularly skewers turkish politicians . a defamation suit was filed against an august cover of penguen in which a cartoon figure of erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant . erdogan tells him , `` but this is so dry . we could have at least slaughtered a journalist . '' in a statement to the press , the penguen team explained that a citizen who described himself as an erdogan supporter `` sent an email to the prime ministry information center . ... according to the notice , the employee -lrb- in the cartoon -rrb- ` made the gay signal with his fingers . ' '' turkey 's public prosecutor eventually launched an investigation , claiming that both the speech bubbles and the `` hand drawing '' insulted erdogan . while the court ruled wednesday in favor of erdogan , a full-length explanation of the verdict will be released in a week to 10 days . it is so far unclear whether the judge ruled that the speech bubbles or the `` gay hand gesture '' or both were an insult . the ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists , students and public figures for `` defamation against a public officer . '' in 2014 , turkey was ranked one of the world 's worst jailers of journalists by the media watchdog group reporters without borders and its press status `` not free '' by freedom house . the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , nils muižnieks , expressed his concern about the ruling against penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting erdogan . `` this sentence is misguided and , along with a pattern of criminal prosecutions , sends a chilling message to media professionals and all those who want to exercise their right to free expression , '' muižnieks said . ann harrison of freedom of press advocacy group pen international told cnn , `` we have long called for decriminalization of defamation , particularly of state officials , as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate . '' harrison noted that special mandates from the united nations , organization for security and co-operation in europe and organization of american states have called for the abolishment of criminal defamation laws . penguen announced it will appeal the decision . the magazine also defiantly released a new cartoon mocking the case . `` we will continue drawing our cartoons , '' penguen announced in a statement . `` we hope this case will be the last example of the intimidation effort on free thought .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- india 's ministry of information and broadcasting has told all news channels not to air a controversial documentary about rape in india -- warning that the excerpts `` appear to encourage and incite violence against women . '' the bbc storyville documentary was originally scheduled to air sunday , but due to the `` intense level of interest '' in the program , the bbc aired it wednesday in the uk on bbc four `` to enable viewers to see this incredibly powerful documentary at the earliest opportunity , '' the broadcaster said in a statement . the documentary was released online and the hashtag #indiasdaughter was trending in the uk after it aired . the documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case that sparked massive outrage and protests in india . an indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in india as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after mukesh singh 's comments were released in several media outlets . singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night , according to the documentary called `` india 's daughter . '' `` the media is likely to be seen as a voice for the perpetrator of such crimes by providing him a medium to communicate his views on the matter repeatedly , '' said a letter sent to media outlets by the indian government . despite the ban , the documentary can be seen on youtube in india . singh told the documentary crew that his victim `` should just be silent and allow the rape . '' `` a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night , '' he told the bbc . `` a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy . boy and girl are not equal . `` housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes . '' he suggested that they `` had a right to teach them a lesson . '' in a statement , india 's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview , which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage . home minister rajnath singh told parliament on wednesday that permission would not be granted to anyone in the future to interview prison inmates after the uproar over the documentary . `` the government has taken necessary legal action and obtained a restraining order from the court disseminating the contents of the film , '' according to the statement . india 's constitution guarantees free speech with a caveat that it could be restricted when speech is deemed a threat to public order , incitement to an offense or an act of contempt of court . in december 2012 , a young woman was savagely attacked and raped by a group of men aboard a public bus in new delhi and later died from her injuries . mukesh singh , who was driving the bus , is now on death row and has filed an appeal . his comments in the documentary have stirred fierce debate about whether airing his interview gives him a platform to share his misogyny , versus those who say it increases awareness and understanding of the horror of rape . the documentary 's director , leslee udwin , wrote that she was `` deeply saddened '' by attempts to silence the film . `` india should be embracing this film -- not blocking it with a knee-jerk hysteria without even seeing it . this was an opportunity for india to continue to show the world how much has changed since this heinous crime , '' she wrote for india 's ndtv . udwin later spoke to ndtv , urging everyone to watch the film before rushing to judgment on it . `` i appeal to the prime minister to not let it go out of hand because it is getting out of hand . countries around the world will very soon be saying : ` how dare india ban a documentary that is in the public interest ? ' i urge you to see the film as soon as possible , '' she said . `` please see the film and then talk about it . '' several supporters of the film echoed the notion that even airing the repugnant views increases awareness and points to a more systematic problem . one said that it is the role of journalism to report `` on the sickness , '' and actress freida pinto asked : `` airing the truth a crime ? how ? '' one journalist expressed concerns that the use of prior restraint amounted to censorship by the government and set a precedent . the debate in social media caused hashtags #nirbhayainsulted and #indiasdaughter to trend in india . many criticized the documentary for giving rapists a platform to share their thoughts and justify rape . one asked why `` rapists are treated as celebrities . '' lawyer and prominent feminist indira jaising called the filmmaker `` irresponsible . '' `` creating public space for them , encouraging tolerance of any form of violence , what the film will do , it will project justifications for rape -- which i think is completely wrong . it 's going on public view where young people will be seeing it , there 's no guarantee these convicts wo n't be seen as natural role models for most . '' many questioned how udwin was able to obtain 16 hours of interviews with the imprisoned singh . the home minister told the upper house of parliament on wednesday that no one would be allowed to `` leverage '' the 2012 gang rape for commercial purposes . he also said that the filmmakers violated the conditions for the shoot inside tihar prison and that officials would determine who granted permission for the interview . one prominent feminist said she opposed airing the documentary because it infringed on india 's laws . singh and three other convicts are currently appealing their death sentences . kavita krishnan , secretary of the all india progressive women 's association , said she did n't have a problem with people viewing the film but said the timing was not appropriate . `` the concern is that the airing of the documentary will result in a media trial -- that will essentially leave the judiciary with no option but to uphold the death penalty , '' she said . `` my main problem , how can we screen this documentary when there 's an appeals process underway ? '' krishnan suggested that the documentary 's title , `` india 's daughter , '' inferred that indians were badly in need of a rescue mission , leaving the impression of a `` white savior '' complex . `` india 's daughter '' is directed by udwin , a british woman who spent two years on the project . she said she was inspired by the mass protests that followed the gang rape case in delhi . among the voices in the debate , some were critical of what they perceived as western bias that depicts india as a place of misogyny when rape and sexual assaults are universal . `` i have tried to convey that while we in india are in fact engaged in confronting the violence and discrimination against women here , it does not help for people in other countries to imagine that such brutality is india 's ` cultural ' problem ; that india 's ` backwardness ' is the problem ; or that gender violence is ` worse out there in india , ' '' krishnan wrote . cnn 's madison park reported and wrote from hong kong . cnn 's harmeet shah singh reported from new delhi .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- to beat the world 's best golfers you often have to be flawless -- and that 's what inbee park managed at the hsbc women 's champions tournament , playing 72 holes without dropping a shot . the south korean triumphed by two strokes from teen prodigy lydia ko , who took park 's world no. 1 ranking last month -- at 17 the youngest player of either gender to reach the summit . ko , born in korea but raised in new zealand , had to settle for second place at sentosa in singapore on sunday -- international women 's day -- after winning her previous two events . `` she played great all week , '' ko said of her 26-year-old rival , who will stay second when the new rankings are released next week . `` no bogeys around here and on a course where you can hit a good shot and you can get bad luck . that 's pretty phenomenal . '' park , who finished 15 under par , won not only $ 210,000 for winning the lpga event but also $ 7,500 from a bet with her dad -- with the stakes at $ 500 for a birdie and $ 1,000 for a bogey . `` this week was just incredible , '' said park , who has held the no. 1 ranking for a total of 73 weeks in two periods and now has career prize money of nearly $ 10.3 million . `` i do n't think i can even believe myself that i did n't make any bogeys for 72 holes . '' park led the tournament from start to finish , and closed with two-under-par 70 -- a score matched by ko -- as she claimed her 13th lpga tour title . she has now played 92 holes without dropping a shot , going back to the third round of last week 's honda lpga thailand , where she tied for seventh . `` it 's good to have a family here and they are big energy , '' said park , who got married last october . `` this week just went so quick . i did n't have to think about golf when i 'm not on the course , so i think that was a big help . '' former world no. 1 stacey lewis finished third , two shots behind ko , as the american finished with a par 72 . `` it was fun being in the final group . that 's where you want to be . but even par usually does n't cut it , '' said lewis , who won the tournament in 2013 .
kiev , ukraine -lrb- cnn -rrb- the bodies of all 33 workers killed in coal mine explosion wednesday in eastern ukraine have been recovered , officials with the donetsk regional authority said . preliminary information indicates the explosion at zasyadko mine was caused by methane gas , according to dan , the official news agency for the self-proclaimed donetsk people 's republic -lrb- dpr -rrb- . `` this did not happen because of shelling , '' an emergency services official told the news agency . the explosion occurred just before 6 a.m. local time , when 230 people were at the mine , the official website for separatist-controlled donetsk city said . of those , 157 were evacuated in the initial hours after the blast , including 14 injured and one dead , according to the website . fifteen rescue teams are working at the scene , it said . zasyadko mine is one of the most dangerous in terms of methane in ukraine , according to the ukrainian news agency ukrinform , which reported that 240 people had died at the mine since 1999 -- 101 miners were killed in a single accident in 2007 . ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk , speaking at a cabinet meeting , accused the pro-russian separatists who control the area of denying ukrainian rescue teams access to the site , ukrinform reported . he urged russia to tell the separatists to allow in the rescue workers . `` you took millions of ukrainians in donetsk and luhansk hostage and are now brutalizing miners ' families by not letting in help , '' ukrinform quoted him as saying . ukrainian president petro poroshenko also called for rescuers to be allowed in . `` i demand ukrainian rescue workers and investigators to be granted access at the site of the tragedy , '' he tweeted . however , dpr representative denis pushilin said ukraine had not offered help with the rescue , and the dpr will ask russia or separatist authorities in luhansk for help if needed , according to the separatists ' news agency . separatist leader aleksandr zakharchenko issued an order to close the mine a month ago , but managers ignored the order because the mine legally belongs to ukraine , ukrinform cited the separatist news agency as saying . a shaky ceasefire is currently in place in donetsk and the neighboring luhansk region , the center of a months-long conflict between pro-russian separatists and ukrainian government forces . journalist victoria butenko reported from kiev , and laura smith-spark wrote in london . cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .
kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- a turkish airlines jet carrying 224 people skidded off a runway wednesday morning at kathmandu 's airport , forcing those on board to evacuate and effectively shutting down nepal 's lone international airport , authorities said . the airbus a330 's crew first tried landing the plane around 7 a.m. wednesday -lrb- 8:30 p.m. et tuesday -rrb- , getting very close to a runway but not touching down , according to passenger deepak malhotra . that was followed by an announcement that the aircraft could n't land due to poor visibility . about 45 minutes later , though , the crew tried again . this time , the turkish airlines plane did get on the ground but it did n't stay on the runway , according to airport officials . the aircraft skidded off , screeching to a stop with its nose pitched down . pictures showed passengers and crew going down evacuation slides and walking through heavy fog . despite the rough landing , there were no reports of serious injuries , according to a turkish airlines spokesman . still , the incident did manage to knock out air travel in and out of the tribhuvan international airport , the only way in for foreigners wanting to explore mount everest and other nearby peaks in the himalayan mountains . that 's because part of the now-immobile airbus a330 was covering a section of the runway . nepal does n't have the heavy-duty machinery required to move it , said ratish chandra lal suman , the head of the mountainous asian nation 's civil aviation authority . and large cargo planes that could be brought in to help with the job have nowhere to land now . having them land anywhere else in nepal is n't an option either . instead , authorities are exploring possibly flying in needed equipment to india and then driving it over to nepal . until then , all international flights into kathmandu have been called off until further notice . that includes 40 arriving and 40 departing flights canceled wednesday . journalist manesh shrestha reported from kathmandu , cnn 's sugam pokharel reported from india and cnn 's greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta .
hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` go back home ! '' `` locusts ! you 're not welcome here ! '' these were just some of the insults hurled at chinese shoppers sunday as hundreds of hong kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of yuen long , an area close to the city 's border with china . it was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls , with demonstrators singling out the `` parallel traders '' who crowd into hong kong to purchase tax-free products and then resell them for a profit back in china . `` i 've grown up here , and ever since a lot of the chinese started coming into hong kong , things have changed , '' said suen , a law student who only gave her surname . clad in a mask to protect against police wielding pepper spray , she took part in the protest with her mother . local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace , but are driving up the price of food , rent , and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers , pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to chinese shoppers . `` previously there were a lot of indigenous places like restaurants , but all of them have closed , '' said suen , standing across from a store selling baby milk powder - the top item on many chinese tourists ' shopping lists . `` it 's very difficult to be very welcoming . '' tensions have long been simmering between hong kong and the motherland , and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland chinese to the city . a series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine-tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across china -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in hong kong as chinese flocked to buy up the city 's supplies . the ensuing uproar led the government to introduce a law limiting the purchase to two tins per traveler leaving the city . last year , 31 million chinese visitors traveled to hong kong , accounting for 78 % of all tourists , according to the government . but the numbers hide that the visitors are n't all sightseeing tourists in the traditional sense . there are the day-trippers , wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border , but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland chinese who are buying up luxury properties , and visit the city on a regular basis . according to the global property guide , developers say as much as 40 % of new home buyers are from china . residents blame them for causing a hike in real estate prices in what reports say is already the most expensive property market in the world . both the chinese and hong kong government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy . relaxed restrictions have made it easy for chinese residents to get a hold of individual multiple-entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass . this has infuriated protestors , particularly the younger generation , who want the government to scrap the permits . in a speech last tuesday , the city 's pro-beijing leader c.y. leung announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors , acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of hong kong residents . but the permit controversy is just one symptom of a deeper conflict . when it comes down to it , it 's simple : many hong kongers just do n't feel very chinese . according to a recent survey by the chinese university of hong kong , the number of hong kong residents identifying primarily as `` chinese '' has dipped to an all-time low since the former british colony was returned to chinese control in 1997 . the majority of respondents said they were `` hong kongers first , and also chinese . '' earlier in 2012 , plans to add chinese civic education into the hong kong public school curriculum caused an uproar , resulting in a city-wide protest with locals claiming it would `` brainwash '' school children with pro-mainland propaganda . hong kong , ruled under china 's principle of `` one country , two systems , '' means the city is a officially part of china , but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other chinese cities . but there 's one key privilege beijing has refused to grant to hong kong : free and open elections for their own leader . frustrated hong kongers have tried everything to demand greater voting rights , from hunger strikes to massive street occupations , with no luck . that 's why people in hong kong feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex , growing rift between their city and mainland china . a small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say hong kong should not belong to china at all . `` we hong kong people have our own culture , we have our own currency , we have all the requirements to build a country . '' said julian li , a member of a radical pro-hong kong group . `` for decades we have been fighting against civic rights , democracy . however , no matter how much we have been working , it 's like we 're begging for something that will never happen . '' many mainland chinese are bewildered by the anger directed at them . `` it 's normal for people to spend money and shop here , why are they protesting ? '' said a chinese tourist waiting at a bus stop to get away from the angry crowds . she said her suitcase was loaded with make-up and clothing that is much cheaper to buy in hong kong than across the border in her hometown of zhuhai . `` there 's definitely an element of discrimination against mainlanders here . i 'm not saying everyone is like that in hong kong , but there are certain people who are very prejudiced , '' she added . another chinese resident who makes weekly visits to relatives in the city was sitting on a curb away from the ruckus . she said her friends have considered boycotting hong kong altogether . `` my friends on wechat say , do n't come to hong kong , let 's burn our travel permits , '' she said as she thumbed through the receipts of her latest purchases . `` we should all just be more considerate and tolerant of each other , we 're just here to shop . let 's just be happy , '' she said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- with the passing of leonard nimoy , fans worldwide mourned the loss of the legendary performer who gave life to the vulcan first officer on star trek . as spock , nimoy touched audiences with his commitment to the principles of science and logic , and his embrace of `` infinite diversity in infinite combinations . '' nimoy 's portrayal has inspired generations to pursue careers in space , science and technology , to embrace the uniqueness of others , and to appreciate the same in themselves . it is difficult to measure the impact of nimoy 's iconic role , particularly on the science and technology communities . for decades , many of the best and brightest inventors , explorers and engineers have credited star trek with sparking their imaginations . for many , spock holds a sacred spot as not only one of the most beloved characters in all of science fiction , but the earliest example of star trek 's enduring legacy of inspiring innovation in the real world . spock first appeared on our television screens in 1966 with the premiere of the original star trek series . since then , the show has earned a reputation for predicting future technologies with remarkable accuracy . at a time when the computer age was only just beginning and the idea of handheld communication devices or tablet computers were fantasies of a far-off future , spock could be seen working with many of these technologies aboard the u.s.s. enterprise . as we soon discovered , his incredible tools and gadgets were n't so distant after all . soon , we moved closer to realizing these devices in our own world with the development of the integrated circuit . portable and handheld computers were suddenly possible , and some scientists turned to star trek for inspiration as they sought to design the next wave of modern marvels . one such scientist was martin cooper , inventor of the first mobile phone , who has credited the handheld communicators used by captain kirk and spock as the source of his inspiration . even though cooper 's original cellular telephone was n't as compact as spock 's , and most consumers could n't afford one for some time , it was n't long before they would become ubiquitous in our world . the same is true for the handheld computers spock used to record scientific data . about the size of a notepad , and sometimes equipped with a stylus , these handy gadgets would go on to appear in every incarnation of the star trek franchise . they are known as padds -- personal access display devices -- and it 's hard to ignore their influence on the the real thing . from their design and function to the name of today 's most popular tablet computer , spock may well have been the first ipad user . another technological wonder that first appeared in spock 's hands was known as the tricorder . this mobile scanning device could be used to take readings while on an away mission to an alien planet . this data might include atmospheric conditions , radiation levels , or even the chemical composition of an object . the version nimoy used on set was bulky and had to be worn with a shoulder strap . however , tricorders would soon become one of the most versatile and sought-after pieces of treknology . today , our smartphones can deliver many features of the tricorder , while more specialized scientific and medical instruments are able to duplicate some of the more advanced scanning capabilities . it was n't just computers and productivity gadgets that spock brought to life on screen . he was often a proponent of passive resistance and non-violent solutions . along with his fellow crew mates , he presented us with new ideas like weapons `` set to stun '' that formed the core of the star trek ethos . as we still wrestle with violence in our world , today 's scientists and law enforcement are working toward breakthroughs in non-lethal weapons in an effort to prevent unnecessary loss of life . the original star trek series predicted or even inspired these and many other technologies in only three seasons on television . of course , the franchise would continue this tradition with four more television series and twelve movies . over the course of nearly 50 years , star trek has given us many more ideas that we 've realized , like touch-screen and voice-control computer interfaces , and others we have n't quite mastered yet . tech concepts like the universal translator , the holodeck , the replicator and , of course , the transporter hold the potential to radically change our world -- and they might not be as far off as we think . our iphones and tablets have made touch screens commonplace , and we can communicate with siri or google through voice commands just like the computer on the enterprise -lrb- though maybe not as effectively -rrb- . we can instantly connect with others across great distances and even across language barriers thanks to recent advancements like microsoft 's skype translator technology . meanwhile , 3d printers allow for on-demand fabrication of many objects , and immersive virtual reality devices may soon make holographic adventures as common as video games . scientists have even been able to transport particles of matter across distances , perhaps taking the first steps toward transporting people through space one day . as we say goodbye to leonard nimoy , let us remember him not only for his work as an actor on star trek , but for his remarkable role in the world of science and technology . through spock , nimoy challenged us to understand our human nature , including our scientific curiosity , and in the process helped inspire countless men and women to reach for the stars . this is one more way that nimoy will be remembered , in the hearts and minds of so many scientists , helping us all to `` live long and prosper . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- and breathe . real madrid squeezed through to the quarterfinals of the european champions league -- but only just . the 10-time-winner escaped a humiliating exit from the tournament after going down 4-3 at home to german side schalke allowing it to sneak through 5-4 on aggregate . had it not been for cristiano ronaldo , who scored twice to ensure his place as the record goalscorer in european football competitions , then it could have been far more embarrassing . as it was , real 's players were met with the waving of handkerchiefs and whistles on an evening which threatened to spiral from disaster into ignominy . real 's malaise has been well documented but this latest chapter , where it was hugely fortunate to escape with its hands still on the trophy , offered yet more questions than answers . carlo ancelotti 's team have endured a difficult few weeks , but if his players had arrived at the bernabeu hoping to silence the sniping critics then they failed miserably . this was a dire display from one of the most expensively assembled teams on the planet , who but for arguably the world 's greatest player , would have succumbed to one of the most embarrassing defeats in the club 's illustrious history . make no bones about it - real was rumbled . schalke , produced a fine performance , full of courage , energy and a zest which their opponent could scarcely match . had it not been for one player on the opposing side then perhaps this would have been one of the most famous nights in schalke 's history . unfortunately , that one player was ronaldo . as lethargic and lackadaisical as real was throughout the contest , ronaldo 's two goals , both headers , ensured its place in the next round . nobody has scored more goals than ronaldo in european club football -- his 77th and 78th taking him to the top of the chart ahead of his nemesis , lionel messi . his latest efforts may not have been the most spectacular , but they were so very precious given the nature of the tie . leading 2-0 from the first leg in gelsenkirchen , real was firm favorite to progress . no team in the history of the competition had lost the first leg 2-0 at home and managed to progress -- and schalke appeared unlikely to alter that statistic . coached by roberto di matteo , who led chelsea to champions league glory in 2012 , schalke arrived hoping to give a good account of themselves , according to the italian . fifth in the german league , this was hardly a team which was supposed to send madrid into a meltdown -- and yet that 's what came to fruition . but , given the recent form of the carlo ancelotti 's side , perhaps this was not so unexpected . last weekend 's league defeat at athletic bilbao brought about a new wave of criticism for ancelotti . toppled from the summit by arch rival barcelona , real has struggled in recent weeks for consistency by its own high standards . its astounding 22-game winning streak was curtailed by valencia on january 4 and the style and swagger which was so evident during that run soon fell away . a 4-0 defeat by champion and city rival atletico in february was difficult to stomach as was the defeat in the basque country to bilbao -- but real 's problems stretch beyond results . real began slowly , in fact , slowly would have been an improvement on what was quite a dreadful opening period . those in white shirts appeared to be running in slow motion as schalke took the contest to its opponent with a zest and spirit which real could not match . having already fired several warning shots , schalke finally made the breakthrough its energy and enterprise deserved when christian fuchs fired home after good work by klaas-jan huntelaar . real , abject in the extreme , appeared bereft of ideas , short on confidence and as if those on the field had merely stumbled upon the stadium 's turf without actually meeting one another . fortunately , in ronaldo , real has a man who has power beyond those of his fellow mortals . schalke 's lead lasted just five minutes -- ronaldo finding both time and space inside the penalty area before heading home from close range . that strike , his 40th of the season , should have settled the home side down . yet , what followed , was another example of real 's fragility . first , huntelaar , once a real player , pounced upon raphael varane 's dreadful backpass only for his effort to lack the necessary power . soon after , the dutchman struck the crossbar with a fine volley from 25-yards which left iker casillas , the real goalkeeper , clutching at thin air . schalke sensed its opportunity and with four minutes of the first half it finally struck when max meyer , the 19-year-old , fired home after casillas had fumbled huntelaar 's effort . real was reeling -- and yet it was ronaldo once again who got it out of trouble . fabio coentrao , the left-back , produced a fine cross and ronaldo eased away from his marker to head his second of the game . that should have been that for schalke , at least real might have felt that way when karim benzema put his side ahead for the first time on the night . the frenchman danced his way through the defense before coolly netting real 's third of the evening with eight minutes of the second period played . while real continued to threaten in attack , its defense remained suspect . leroy sane , just 19 years of age , was the next beneficiary of the home side 's reluctance to put pressure on the ball . the midfielder was allowed both time and space to take aim and curl a quite sumptuous effort into the far corner past the watching casillas . real , unbeaten at home in the champions league since april 2011 , remained vulnerable , particularly at the heart of the midfield . it was one of those midfielders , luka modric , back from injury , whose mistake gave huntelaar the opportunity to set up a pulsating finish . modric 's loose pass allowed the forward to take the ball in his stride before unleashing an unstoppable effort which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar . as the whistles rang out , those in blue poured forward with the impressive sane forcing casillas into a fine stop as the visitors edged closer and closer to an all important fifth goal . with the clock ticking down , schalke threw everyone forward in search of a dramatic winner -- but when the ball broke to benedikt howedes , the defender could only fire his shot straight at casillas . the referee 's whistle brought relief , though the howls of derision from the home supporters gave the players an idea of their recent failings . `` getting through to the next round is very important for us , sometimes you have to suffer and this will make us stronger , '' said modric . `` we have to get back to playing the way we were at the start of the season , we have a lot of quality and i think that we 're going to see a much better real madrid in the next game . '' porto power through . in the night 's other game , porto trounced swiss side fc basel 4-0 to secure a 5-1 aggregate victory . porto , winners in 2004 under jose mourinho , eased home courtesy of goals from yacine brahimi , hector herrera , casemiro and vincent aboubakar . `` you have to applaud the entire team for this fantastic performance against a very difficult opponent who came here determined to qualify , '' julen lopetegui , the porto coach , told reporters . `` we deserve to be in the champions league quarterfinals even if we came through qualifying . `` i am very happy and very proud of my players who showed a lot of character . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the image of the braided kurdish female fighter , donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group isis , may have done more to promote the kurdish cause in the west than anything else in recent years . the iraqi kurds have long been pro-western in orientation , but western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support , in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence . now , with soccer moms in middle america tweeting photos of kurdish female fighters , western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid kurdish policies to their constituencies . jacob russell 's sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of kurdish female fighters . since last summer , international media -- and kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women . images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour -lrb- `` girls with guns , '' as russell calls this type of portrayal -rrb- tend to portray more of the photographer 's assumptions about the woman 's emancipation than her actual experiences as a kurdish woman in combat . russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters . `` i was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters , '' he said . `` i think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by kurdish leaders -lrb- who -rrb- know very well how attractive this image is to the western media . '' having lived in kurdistan for nearly two years , russell understands that many women join the peshmerga or other kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons . many of the women he photographed turned to the peshmerga to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` a lot of the women 's backstories were quite difficult , '' he said . `` it seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal kurdish society , because despite being relatively progressive -lrb- within the middle east -rrb- , it is still quite a conservative society . '' russell explores the theme of sisterhood , and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck , their fingers intertwined . that photo , he says , is his favorite from the shoot . `` i think that image is one of the more expressive ones that -lrb- shows -rrb- what really seems to be going on there , '' he said . `` i did n't want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of -lrb- isis -rrb- fighters . that just did n't seem to be the case . '' russell remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role , conveying to the world the -lrb- relatively -rrb- progressive values that kurds pride themselves on . the women now serve a political role , too . as western governments eye more military engagement with kurdish forces in iraq and syria , these women may boost the kurds ' international standing . jacob russell is a photographer based in lebanon . you can follow him on instagram and twitter .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- italian authorities have arrested 42 people suspected of belonging to a mafia network in southern italy , some of whom are accused of extorting tens of thousands of euros from businesses monthly , police said tuesday . among the evidence : a piece of paper , hidden in a bicycle handlebar , that listed businesses that the crime syndicate was extorting , according to the carabinieri , italy 's military police . the carabinieri said they made the arrests while raiding homes in 11 provinces . the crime network is based in casal di principe , a village roughly 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- northwest of naples , police said . the mafia network extorted shop owners to the tune of 200,000 euros a month and extorted operators of slot machines and online gambling a further 100,000 euros monthly , the carabinieri said . the arrests stem from an investigation that started in october 2012 . investigators also found notebooks with the group 's organizational chart and names of jailed associates who still were on the mafia payroll , according to the carabinieri . the note in the bicycle handlebar was among other `` pizzini , '' or little pieces of paper allegedly used by mafia members to exchange information , that investigators discovered in the probe , the military police said . in villa literno , close to casal di principe , investigators discovered a bunker that allegedly was used to hide fugitive affiliates of the mafia , the carabinieri said . an anti-mafia prosecutor in naples filed charges against the 42 , including mafia association , extortion and illegal possession of weapons .
boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- dzhokhar tsarnaev 's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement in the boston marathon bombing trial : he did it . `` it was him , '' defense attorney judy clarke told jurors . tsarnaev carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on april 15 , 2013 , and placed it near the finish line , she said . he was there when a police officer was killed . he was involved in a shootout with police . the accused bomber will not sidestep any of his actions , clarke said . so , why even a trial at all ? because there 's disagreement over why tsarnaev did it , clarke said . dzhokhar tsarnaev was influenced by his brother , tamerlan tsarnaev , clarke said . he was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts , she said . the first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of the prosecution and defense . based on their opening statements , both sides agree on the basic facts around the attacks -- who carried them out and how . but both sides presented divergent views of why dzhokhar tsarnaev carried out the attacks . the goal of the tsarnaev brothers was to kill as many people as possible , u.s. prosecutor bill weinreb said during his initial statement to jurors . the prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish line of the 2013 boston marathon and painted a picture of dzhokhar tsarnaev as a holy warrior committed to violence . more than 260 others were maimed or injured by two pressure cooker bombs that exploded within 12 seconds of each other . a fourth person , an mit police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , allegedly ran from police . tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , was killed after a gunbattle with police . so it is dzhokhar tsarnaev who is on trial , charged with 30 counts related to the bombings . weinreb said tsarnaev 's actions after the bombings -- going to whole foods to buy a gallon of milk , hanging out with friends -- show that he did n't care about what he did . to the contrary , the prosecutor told jurors , he believed he had done good . the motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became tsarnaev 's hideout before his arrest , he said . there , tsarnaev allegedly wrote messages explaining that he believed the u.s. government is an enemy of islam . boston marathon bombing timeline . tsarnaev listened to jihadist lectures and songs , and had an online presence in which he espoused a radical view of islam , weinreb said . he had a collection of magazines published by al qaeda , one with instructions for building the same type of bomb used in the boston marathon attack , he said . the defense pinned the radicalization on tamerlan . clarke showed two side-by-side photos in court : one of the brothers smiling , and one of them carrying backpacks linked to the attacks . the attacks were `` incomprehensible , they 're inexcusable , '' she said , but also asked , who turned tsarnaev from the smiling kid into a bomber ? it was tamerlan who self-radicalized , and tamerlan who influenced his brother to follow him , she argued . at the outset of the trial , weinreb spoke in detail to the jury about the lives ended by the pair of bombs at the marathon . martin richard , an 8-year-old spectator , was standing with his family cheering runners on when the second bomb exploded just feet away . martin was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds , the prosecutor said . the bomb blew large holes into the boy 's chest and organs -- `` tore large chunks of flesh out of martin 's body , '' weinreb said . the boy died . the first witness the prosecution called wednesday was thomas grilk , executive director of the boston athletic association . grilk provided some facts about the marathon , but assistant u.s. attorney aloke chakravarty also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings . the prosecution played videos of the first explosion , then the second , showing people scrambling in the aftermath . grilk let out a long sigh as one of the videos was paused . `` every day you walk outside , you are in that area , '' testified shane o'hara , the manager at marathon sports , a running store close to where the bombs went off . he was emotional as he vividly recounted what sounded to him like a loud cannon , and the instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows . o'hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair , and cries for help . the decisions about who to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunt him , he said . there were cries , sirens and screams , he said in answer to prosecutors ' questions . he sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the court . he told the jury the plea he heard from one of the injured : `` stay with me , stay with me . '' wednesday 's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors . tsarnaev 's lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what they lived through that day . colton kilgore and rebekah gregory were part of a large group who were present to cheer on a family member . kilgore took the witness stand and described the videos he shot after the blasts . it was an instinct to record the scene , he said . `` i was blown through the air . there was a deafening explosion , '' he said . he saw bodies and faces also tumble through the air . his videos captured the chaos , the cries for help , people using any material they could find to help perform first aid . at one point , kilgore recalled , he sat on something hot , only to realize he was sitting on pieces of burning metal and shards . gregory testified that she was watching the race , but also looking after her 5-year-old , noah , who was a bit bored . after the blast , she could n't feel her legs . `` my bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk , '' she said . `` at that point i thought that was the day i would die . '' her first instinct was for noah 's safety . she asked god to take her if she was indeed dying , but to let her know that noah was ok . somehow , she said , despite the confusion and her pain , she could hear his voice calling her . noah was injured . gregory now wears a prosthesis . sydney corcoran was a high school senior on the day of the bombings . her testimony centered on her near certainty that she would die that day . she passed out and awoke to a group of men attending to her , putting pressure on her leg , trying to find where she was bleeding . one man put his forehead on her head and told her she would be ok . but then , another man said he could see her eyes were going white , she testified . `` i could feel my body going tingly and i was getting increasingly cold . i knew i was dying , '' she told the jury . it took nearly two months of juror interviews -- 256 people over 22 court days -- to select the jury in the bombing trial . the group includes 18 people from across the socioeconomic spectrum , but the group is almost exclusively white . race has been an issue raised by tsarnaev 's defense during four unsuccessful attempts to move the death penalty trial from boston . his attorneys argued that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that 's older and whiter than the community at large . but prosecutors argued that the jury had been picked properly . `` the prosecution got exactly what they wanted , '' said cnn legal analyst mark geragos , a criminal defense attorney in los angeles . middle-aged white jurors tend to be more likely to support death penalty verdicts , he said . `` it 's a target demographic for a death penalty jury . '' just one juror seemed to combine youth and ethnic diversity . a college student who is taking a break from his studies , he said his mother was born in iran and converted from islam to the baha'i faith . the slip away , a boat in which tsarnaev sought cover after the police gunbattle , also is expected to be a key piece of evidence . the prosecution is seeking to remove a panel on which tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so jurors can see it . weinreb has said the boat is too large to bring into the courthouse . the defense , however , wants the jury to see the entire boat , complete with bullet holes . defense attorney david bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect tsarnaev 's state of mind . court papers have already given the public a glimpse of several statements tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside the boat : . `` the u.s. government is killing our innocent civilians , '' he allegedly wrote . `` i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished . '' `` we muslims are one body . you hurt one , you hurt us all . '' `` now i do n't like killing innocent people . it is forbidden in islam but due to said -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- it is allowed . '' `` stop killing our innocent people and we will stop . '' cnn 's ann o'neill reported from boston , and mariano castillo wrote in atlanta . cnn 's sonia moghe contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the sun cuts across lake nicaragua , casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats . rowing in unison , two girls paddle a canoe to school . life on lake nicaragua is peaceful , rustic and isolated , but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to panama 's famed waterway . headed by hong kong-based consortium hk nicaragua canal development investment company -lrb- hknd -rrb- , the $ 50 billion nicaragua canal -lrb- also called the nicaragua grand canal and interoceanic canal -rrb- would create a gargantuan new shipping route through nicaragua by connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans . hknd was granted a 50-year concession by the nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278-kilometer -lrb- 172 miles -rrb- canal , reportedly with the option for an extension . construction will run from the rio punta gorda on the caribbean coast to brito on the pacific . at up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep , the canal , if completed , will be deeper and wider than the panama canal . hknd announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on december 22 , 2014 . the canal will run through lake nicaragua -lrb- among other areas -rrb- , central america 's largest lake and freshwater reservoir , which not only preserves an integral part of nicaragua 's ecosystem , but directly supports numerous communities . by some estimates , 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal . the prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area , and those who cherish its untouched splendor . with the pending completion of the canal in 2019 , lake nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal . environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake wo n't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction . additionally , communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction . `` in terms of the canal impact on lake nicaragua , one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water ; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species , plants and animals , '' dr. jorge a. huete-perez , vice president of the nicaraguan academy of sciences and director of the molecular biology center at the university of central america told cnn . `` dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a ` dead zone ' because of hypoxia , eutrophication and turbidity . '' in january , london-based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the interamerican network of academies of science , nicaraguan academy of sciences and international council for science -- had reached similar conclusions , warning of `` unintended adverse consequences that could do economic , environmental and social harm . '' like other critics of the canal construction , huete-perez wants greater transparency from hknd and the nicaraguan government . `` this whole thing has been fast-tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed , documented debate , '' said huete-perez . on january 9 , 2015 , hknd responded to concerns about the lake 's impact on communities in a statement on its website . `` from july 21 to july 30 , 2014 , we and our environmental and social impact advisor , environmental resources management -lrb- erm -rrb- , held scoping meetings across nicaragua . approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings , including housewives , students , professionals , agricultural producers , fishermen , artisans , businessmen and scholars , '' reads the company 's statement , in part . the company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical , geological , cultural and environmental impact of the project . some skeptics doubt the hyper-ambitious canal is realistic . pedro alvarez , chairman of civil engineering at rice university , has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed . he worries that it will be abandoned . his greatest concern is severe damage to lake nicaragua . despite the concerns of environmental experts , the project is underway , making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever . largely unmarred by development , lake nicaragua is a sight to behold . during my recent guided visit with nicaragua vacations , i took a boat tour through the islets of granada , home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of mombacho volcano . at times , there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano , ensconced in clouds and morning fog . the feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of lake nicaragua 's charm . another part of its charm is the people who live on it . at padre nello school on lake nicaragua , about 90 children canoe to school each day . jicaro island ecolodge works with padre nello to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake . guests of the lodge can arrange visits . the islets are just southeast of the city of granada -lrb- population approximately 120,000 -rrb- , where colonial buildings defy time , narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards , charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews . while granada pulses with old world charm , lake nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass , mostly untouched by modernity . for now . nicaragua vacations ; +1 866 347 4012 . jicaro island ecolodge , granada isleta , nicaragua ; +505 2558 7652 -lrb- hotel -rrb- , +505 2558 7702 -lrb- reservations -rrb- . cnn 's frida ghitis also contributed to this report . kristin braswell is a brooklyn-based journalist . she 's contributed to essence , abc news , npr and ebony , among others .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- robots serve you drinks , you can skydive on deck and a mechanical arm hoists you 300 feet into the air to view the ship . you could be forgiven for thinking you had been transported into the future on board the new $ 1 billion cruise ship quantum of the seas . as its name suggests , it is very much a quantum leap in boat building . the latest brainchild of royal caribbean , which has branded the newest member of its fleet the `` smartest cruise ship in history , '' it is basically a fun palace on the high seas . everything , it seems , is a first : the first bumper cars , skydive simulator and bionic bar on a ship . and among the 19 restaurants on board , there is something for everyone . those of a literary slant can even dine at wonderland , with waitresses dressed up in characters from the novel by lewis carroll . such are the maverick creations on board from bow to stern , it is a vessel befitting of the mad hatter . `` this is the smartest cruise ship , '' says harri kulovaara , executive vice-president of maritime at royal caribbean and head of the design process behind the project . `` this is probably going to be a big change for the industry and the future . '' and this is not just royal caribbean 's prediction . `` it 's unique and unusual , and we just had fun -- pure and simple , '' is the assessment of carolyn spencer brown , the editor of cruise critic , after spending eight days on quantum . `` royal caribbean are always raising the bar when it comes to putting stuff on board you 'd never thought you 'd see on a cruise ship . `` they just do things well before anyone else and their ships are traditionally the ones you get most excited about , '' adds spencer brown , who estimates she has been on 300 cruises as part of her job . `` you keep on thinking when they come up with something crazy they 've hit the wall and there ca n't be anything new , but there always is . they keep doing things no-one else has thought of . '' there are bigger cruise ships out there : allure and oasis -- both part of the royal caribbean fleet -- although not quite with the same box of tricks . kulovaara likes to think quantum has something for everyone -- it even has its own `` godmother , '' american actress kristin chenoweth . but what exactly does a price tag of nearly $ 1 billion buy you ? the vessel is 16 stories high , has room for 4,500 passengers and a 1,500-strong crew . it also boasts 18 decks , 2,090 state rooms , is the length of 41 london buses and weighs 167,800 tonnes . built in meyer werft shipyard in papenburg , germany , its first voyage at the end of last year was from southampton to new york , and an eight-day caribbean cruise on board starts from $ 1,333 . the project was first discussed in 2009 and the build took three and a half years . finland-born kulovaara , now based in miami , takes great pride in the fact the vessel was delivered just two minutes late . kulovaara , who has been with the company since 1995 , is proud of the open-thinking mentality that appears to have gone into the design process . `` i do n't remember any major elements that we did not get on the ship , '' he says . `` it 's come together nicely . we have a group of people that love to innovate and look to the future . with this , we started to think about the next generation . `` when we start a new design , we think of the customer and what can we do . we put the customer right in there . how can we provide a better vacation ? we constantly explore novel options , what 's possible on a ship . we have people pushing innovation that just have that in their dna . '' that involves bringing partners on board , including the team behind ripcord by ifly -- provider of skydiving on the deck in an enclosed capsule -- which has long been a company aspiration . `` we 've actively looked at having that on board before the technology was not enclosed and also too noisy , '' adds kulovaara , who spent his childhood summers sailing in the finnish arctic . `` the technology moved on and the energy could be used in a constant loop so there was n't such wasted energy . '' it was the same for the north star , a capsule -- modeled on the london eye -- that gives holiday makers a 360-degree view of the deck but can also protrude over the side of the boat with just the sea below . it is not something for vertigo sufferers . `` north star looks simple but it 's very complex so adding to the ship design was huge , '' explains kulovaara , who says he only got involved in studying naval architecture in order to make him a better yachtsman . `` some of our best resources were working on that for 18 months before the product was started . '' at the bionic bar , passengers can order drinks by ipad and watch as huge bionic arms make any beverage of their choosing . the tech thrills do n't end there : kulovaara claims quantum has the most advanced wifi on board any ship . he says the connectivity , set up by o3b , is as fast as logging on at home or at work -- achieved by using a satellite in much lower orbit than would normally be the case . `` it 's comparable to anything on land , so this is a revolution . '' the company is confident it is winning the cruise wars , and reviews of the vessel have , to date , been very positive . there are , however , rivals . spencer brown cites the examples of both norwegian cruise line and carnival for their own innovations . `` norwegian has this completely nuts rope course on deck 16 with a gang plank which looks down over the sea . they were also the first for alternative restaurants and led the way with outdoor spaces and great party areas with bars and restaurants outside , '' she says . `` carnival are doing some fun design work with carnival vista -lrb- launching in 2016 -rrb- . it 's like a ship within a ship with a separate family zone and a cuban-themed area for adults . `` so royal caribbean are leading the way but it 's nice to see it 's got competition . '' there is a pressure on royal caribbean to raise the bar for its next creation , though kulovaara is not concerned . `` this is about 1 % great idea and 99 % execution , '' he says . `` history tells us that we like to push the envelope and will continue to do that and create very unique experiences . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the attack on tunisia 's famed bardo museum is just the latest evidence that parts of north and sub-saharan africa have become a magnet for islamist extremism . tunisia -- lying just across the mediterranean from europe , but bordered on one side by libya and on the other by algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years . but it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of islamist extremism has intensified in the region . islamist terrorists also have struck in algeria , where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013 , and in libya , where terrorists killed the u.s. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where isis has established a beachhead in the east . al qaeda 's north african offshoot al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , which has its roots in algeria , has captured territory in mali and taken hostages -- often europeans -- in countries such as niger and mauritania . so what is the world doing about it ? the united states has created a military command in africa and also established a special operations base in djibouti , which borders somalia in the horn of africa . france has sent troops to mali . and , as cnn recently reported from chad , western militaries have trained special forces from several northern african nations to take on the islamists . here 's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of africa . algeria is home to a long-running islamist insurgency . in perhaps the highest-profile incident , islamist militants attacked the in amenas oil and gas plant in southern algeria in january 2013 . at least 37 hostages , including three u.s. citizens , died in the seizure of , and ensuing special forces assault on , the remote facility . dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege . the attack was the work of the mulathameen brigade , which translates as the `` signatories in blood brigade . '' last september , another islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old french hiker , herve gourdel , after seizing him as he walked in djudjura national park in central algeria . days earlier , the outfit -- jund al khilafa , a splinter group of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to isis . militants affiliated with aqim had previously also kidnapped foreigners in algeria , including italians and spaniards . in 2007 , aqim launched a suicide bombing campaign in algeria , which included a deadly bombing against the u.n. headquarters in algiers . in january , a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital , tripoli , killed 10 people , including an american . the attack was swiftly claimed by wilayat al-tarabulus , isis ' name for the province . politicians in tripoli disputed the claim . besides its growing presence in tripoli , isis is now the dominant force in derna in eastern libya and controls parts of the town center of sirte , the hometown of former libya strongman moammar gadhafi . before the advent of isis , an islamist group called ansar al shariah was blamed by the united states for carrying out the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi in which ambassador christopher stevens was killed . state department computer expert sean smith and former u.s. navy seals tyrone woods and glen doherty , then acting as security contractors , also died . in 2012 , islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in mali after a military coup and uprising by tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern mali , an area the size of france . france intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the islamists . since then , mali 's government has battled various rebel factions , mostly in its northern region , with the help of french and african forces . recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital , bamako , which killed five people , including french and belgian citizens , authorities said . a north african jihadist group , al-murabitun , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to mauritanian news agency al akhbar . aqim issued a warning to france via jihadist websites in january , following terror attacks in paris , stating that `` france pays the cost of its violence on muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity , '' citing the presence of its soldiers in mali . according to analysis by jane 's defence weekly , despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward libya , `` mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with france and algeria . '' jihadist groups including aqim and the mulathameen brigade operate in the porous border areas between mauritania , algeria , mali , niger and libya . militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom , including three spaniards in 2011 , according to jane 's . however , since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined . mauritanian troops joined the fight against aqim militants in mali . militant group boko haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern nigeria for over a decade . it has attacked the country 's police , military , banks , bus stations and crowded markets , as well carrying out a string of church bombings . perhaps the most notorious incident came last april , when boko haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in chibok , in borno state . most of the girls remain missing . in january this year , hundreds of boko haram gunmen seized the town of baga and neighboring villages in northern nigeria , as well as a multinational military base , leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead . the group 's stated aim is to institute sharia , or islamic law . earlier this month , in an audio message purportedly from leader abubakar shekau , boko haram pledged allegiance to isis . it had previously declared ties to aqim . al-shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of islamic law , or sharia . it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in somalia and beyond , notably neighboring kenya . its most high-profile attack came in that country in 2013 , when gunmen struck at nairobi 's upscale westgate mall , pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers . the gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them . as many as 67 people died in the siege . the group has carried out numerous attacks in somalia 's capital , mogadishu , and elsewhere . just last week , its target was government offices in the city of baidoa . it has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the united states , canada and britain . the pentagon said this week that a key al-shabaab operative connected to the westgate mall attack , named as adan garar , was killed recently by a u.s. drone strike . in september , al-shabaab leader ahmed abdi godane was also killed in a u.s. airstrike near barawe city . gunmen who besieged the bardo museum in tunis are thought to have claimed 23 lives , most of them foreign tourists . interior ministry spokesman mohamed ali aroui told national radio that the assailants were islamists , but authorities have n't been more specific than that . nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack . isis claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online thursday . cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement . the attack occurred even as the country 's democratically elected parliament was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation . up to 3,000 tunisians are believed to have traveled to iraq and syria to fight as jihadists , more than any other country , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london . the fear is that many of these fighters will return to north africa to join isis-affiliated groups there and carry out attacks . al qaeda 's north african affiliate is also a threat . in late 2012 , aqim set up a branch in tunisia called the uqba ibn nafi brigade , a 60-strong jihadi outfit composed of tunisians , algerians , and some libyans . the group , believed to include fighters driven out of mali by french forces , has been responsible for a string of attacks on tunisian security services in mountainous djebel chaambi region along the algerian border . cnn 's tim lister and paul cruickshank contributed to this report .
beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- china has linked violence in its far-western muslim region of xinjiang to isis and says chinese nationals have fought for the extremist group . the communist party chief of xinjiang -- the region 's top official -- told reporters tuesday to view mounting violence there in the context of a global jihadist movement , especially with the rise of isis -- also known as the islamic state or is . `` some extremists in xinjiang have participated in the is and i think this further proves that intentional extremist forces can not be ignored , '' said zhang chunxian on the sidelines of the annual session of china 's rubber-stamp parliament . `` as countries around the world have realized the dangers of is ... we will work with others to stop it at its source . '' a spate of violent attacks in xinjiang -- a resource-rich area long inhabited by the turkic-speaking uyghurs -- has killed hundreds of people in the past two years . the government has blamed the incidents on muslim uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state . china 's state media had earlier reported on muslim uyghur militants trying to flee the country and join isis training camps in preparation for attacks back home . `` we cracked some cases involving people who had just returned after directly participating in fighting , '' zhang revealed . `` such cases sometimes involve ` lone wolves ' and other times involve groups . '' `` the is situation is historically unprecedented , '' he added , addressing criticism on the xinjiang government 's lack of transparency . `` to solve such cases ... to ensure people 's safety , we sometimes have to keep things confidential and take our time . '' exiled uyghur activists have long disputed the chinese government 's assertions , pointing to the lack of evidence and accusing the authorities of using the alleged isis connection to justify their increasingly harsh rule in the region . over the past decades , the arrival in xinjiang of waves of han chinese , the country 's predominant ethnic group , has fueled ethnic tensions . amnesty international has said uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing , education and employment , as well as curtailed religious freedom . other critics have attributed the rise of violence in xinjiang to beijing 's repressive reign there -- a claim the government vehemently denies .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's the home of british politics , steeped in history , tradition and centuries-old pomp . but could the ornate splendor of the uk 's houses of parliament be about to offer a solution to london 's housing crisis ? in all honesty , probably not . however , that has n't stopped housing campaign group , generation rent , from proposing to transform the palace of westminster into affordable new homes . the group 's eye-catching idea is to move the seat of british democracy from one of london 's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of hull , northern england . the vacant house of commons and house of lords -lrb- the uk 's upper legislative chamber -rrb- left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the river thames . according to a press release on the proposal from generation rent , 335 mps from all over the uk currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively . they claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer # 5.26 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- in 2013 alone . by moving the seat of government to hull , a city with the cheapest housing rent in england , millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs , the group claims . westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in london , according to research from house moving firm , delivery quote compare . the ever-rising cost of property in the uk capital , meanwhile , is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city . a january report from rental referencing company , homelet , also found that average rental prices in greater london were more than double that of those found in the rest of the uk . `` we hope our proposal gives mps a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis , '' said director of generation rent , alex hilton . yet even if the generation rent proposals were seriously considered , they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself . speaker of the house , john bercow , said monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to # 3 billion -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- . a 2012 study entitled `` the restorations and renewal of the palace of westminster '' found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks , repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- cnn has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at ucla never obtained permission to sell the device , according to an official at the food and drug administration . olympus started selling its tjf-q180v duodenoscope in 2010 , but the fda did n't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market , according to karen riley , deputy director of strategy for the fda 's office of external affairs . `` why did n't we notice it ? i do n't know , '' riley said . `` can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that did n't go through the approval process ? '' asked dr. steven nissen , the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic , who 's testified to congress about device safety problems . `` devices need to be regulated more vigorously . this is really disturbing . '' in a statement , olympus said it did n't think needed the fda 's permission to sell the device , but now at the request of the agency , it has applied for that permission . that application is still pending . seven hospital patients at ronald reagan ucla medical center were infected with the deadly superbug cre -- also known as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae -- from october to january , according to hospital officials . two of those patients died . the patients caught cre after routine endoscopic treatments . hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak . the medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between october and january and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria . four other patients at cedars-sinai medical center in los angeles have also been infected with the superbug linked to a contaminated duodenoscope , according to a statement released by the hospital . the medical scope was used in all four patients , between august and january 2015 . sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail , `` out of an abundance of caution . '' according to fda rules , a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that `` could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device . '' the tjf-q180v duodenoscope , used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system , includes a modification to the exact part of the device that 's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks . with this new model , olympus sealed up that part of the device , known as the elevator channel , hoping to make it more impervious to infection . `` the company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer , but it seems to be that it was n't safer , '' riley said . last year , at the fda 's request , olympus applied for permission to sell the scope . that application is still pending . riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving , so the agency does n't want to take them off the market . `` more than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the u.s. , and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very , very low , '' she said . `` we believe the benefits outweigh the risks . '' in its statement , olympus wrote : `` the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community . olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with -lsb- duodenoscope procedures -rsb- . '' riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers , pentax and fujifilm , did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to olympus ' tjf-q180v . now the fda is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it 's not going well . riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999 % of all microbes on the scope -- the fda 's standard for disinfection . `` we 're still working with them to get good data , '' she said . riley said she does n't know if the fda will penalize olympus for selling the device without permission . diana zuckerman , a device safety expert , said they should . `` it 's like with kids . how do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave ? '' she said .

kuala lumpur , malaysia -lrb- cnn -rrb- jaquita gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone . a pair of work shoes still sits outside the front door of their home in kuala lumpur waiting to be reclaimed . his uniform still hangs in a cupboard . twelve months after malaysia airlines flight 370 vanished without a trace , gonzales has n't given up hope . she ca n't . neither can her children , other family members and friends . not until there is some conclusive evidence on the fate of the airliner -- one way or another . `` now and then , every once in a while i call his phone and it goes to voicemail , '' she says . `` you never know , he might pick it up , or someone who has them would let them have the phone and you know , the hope is still there . '' she 's not alone . families of victims we spoke to hold on to the slimmest belief that mh370 , which disappeared barely an hour into its flight from kuala lumpur to beijing on march 8 last year , did not crash and that the 239 passengers and crew on board are alive . `` no evidence means there is still a little bit of hope . we tap into that hope in order to go on day by day , '' says gonzales . but she lives a life in limbo . neither able to move on , nor go back . her comfortable home in the suburbs of malaysia 's capital remains virtually the same since her husband of nearly 30 years , patrick gomes , left for work on the evening of march 7 as lead purser on the mh370 red-eye bound for the chinese capital . the only real sign that time has moved on , amid the family photos and plaques celebrating her husband 's work achievements is a newspaper on top of a stack in the living room with the word `` lost '' splashed across its front page . gonzales ' lifeline , apart from family , is her work . she runs a private school and daycare center for about 70 children and spends about 12 hours a day there . keeping busy , she says , keeps her sane . but not a day goes by without her thinking of patrick . `` i can be driving and i just have to pull off the road and weep . everywhere i go i see patrick , '' she says . `` in our home , with my children , with our friends . there are so many times around the home when i say patrick you are supposed to be doing this for me , where are you . he helped me with ironing , with cooking . '' like gonzales , many other families cnn has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility . but along with hope and the pain , many families also share a deep anger . anger at the malaysian authorities and malaysia airlines who , gonzales says , are ignoring them . requests for information are unanswered and attempts to talk to key officials are rebuffed , she says . grace nathan 's mother was on mh370 . for almost a year she and her family grieved in private . but now she has gone public after what she describes as the malaysian authorities continued `` mishandling '' of the disappearance . `` there is a lack of transparency , a lack of communications between us and the relevant authorities , ' she says . `` whenever we 've written to them or asked them for answers they have never replied . `` it 's not like they have n't learned . i would put it that they just do n't care . they just want to move on . they do n't really care about what we feel or what we have to say . '' one recent decision by malaysian authorities has caused bitter resentment among many families . in late january , the government televised a pre-recorded announcement from the civil aviation chief that the passengers and crew of mh370 were `` presumed lost '' after the plane crashed as a result of an accident . families were not been given any advance warning of the announcement and , even though it clears the way for compensation claims , they say there is just no evidence to support the statement . it also came just before chinese new year , a time of celebration . more than 150 passengers on the flight were chinese nationals . to add insult to injury , families say , the government had planned to make the announcement at a press conference but canceled the briefing when next-of-kin rushed to the venue . nathan says she only heard that the government was planning to make the statement when local media rang her . `` they rang to say ` can we come and record your reaction when this declaration is made ? ' our reaction was ` what declaration ? ' we did n't know anything about it . `` i have n't spoken to the media at all since the accident happened but after that treatment i decided it was time that we said something . it was a group decision that we speak to the media because -lrb- the authorities -rrb- never respond to anything we write to them or ask them about , '' she adds . cnn contacted both the malaysian government and malaysia airlines for a response to the families ' claims , but did not receive an answer . for relatives like gonzales and nathan , each day is a struggle , a struggle to stop being overwhelmed by memories . `` i am just going through the motions , ' says grace . `` i am dead inside , i have stopped being happy . every day basically i just force myself to get through the day .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- new york city public schools will now observe two muslim holidays , officials announced wednesday , making the district -- the nation 's biggest -- one of the few to put islamic holy days on its calendar . under the change announced by new york mayor bill de blasio and city schools chancellor carmen farina , there will be no class for eid al-adha , also known as the festival of sacrifice , starting next september 24 . another muslim holiday , eid al-fitr -- a festival marking the end of the holy month of ramadan -- will become a holiday for those in summer school starting in 2016 . `` this is a common-sense change , '' de blasio said wednesday , `` and one that recognizes our growing muslim community and honors its contributions to our city . '' the decision affects some 1 million students in new york city . while it 's not known exactly how many of them are muslim , city council speaker melissa mark-viverito said that almost 1 million of the more than 8 million people in the city 's five boroughs practice islam and a 2009 columbia university study found that roughly 10 % of new york city public school students are muslim . the move is n't a surprise , given de blasio 's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with muslim families in mind . `` muslim students and their families who observe eid al-fitr and eid al-adha should n't have to choose between an instructional day and their religious obligations , '' said farina . `` this new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures . '' linda sarsour , executive director of the arab american association of new york and the parent of three public school students , said a plan in which students would n't have to choose between education and faith `` a win for our children and for future generations in this country . '' `` muslims are a part of the fabric of this country , '' she said . `` we make our country proud , and today , new york city made us proud . '' new york city joins school districts in other states , including new jersey , massachusetts and vermont , that similarly observe muslim holidays , according to a news release from farina 's office . and eid al-fitr and eid al-adha join other religious holidays already on new york 's public school calendar . in addition to holidays like easter that always fall on a weekend , students already have christian holidays such as good friday and christmas off , as well as the jewish holidays of rosh hashanah and yom kippur . cnn 's lorenzo ferigno and rob frehse contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- microsoft co-founder paul allen says he has found the wreck of a long-lost world war ii japanese battleship near the philippines . the philanthropist posted images on twitter that appeared to show the musashi , once one of the two largest warships in the world . the discovery was made aboard his superyacht , the my octopus , as part of an expedition that allen launched . the search has taken allen and his team of researchers more than eight years . the images and video were taken by an unmanned submersible deployed from the vessel . `` since my youth , i have been fascinated with world war ii history , inspired by my father 's service in the u.s. army , '' allen said in a statement . `` the musashi is truly an engineering marvel and , as an engineer at heart , i have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction . i am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her . '' he used his twitter account to publicize the find . in one tweet , he said one image showed the bow of the ship , which features a distinctive chrysanthemum -- the flower is the emblem of japan 's royal family -- and a huge anchor . the other underwater photograph shows one of the musashi 's valves on which the japanese characters for `` main valve handle '' and `` open '' are legible . he said the writing on the valve was proof that the ship was of japanese origin . the director of japan 's kure maritime museum told cnn after viewing the information posted by allen that it appeared that the vessel was the musashi , although further pictures were needed to know for sure . the musashi was one of two yamato-class battleships constructed by the imperial japanese navy . launched in 1940 , it was , at the time , the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons . the musashi sank on october 24 , 1944 , during the battle of the sibuyan sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf , in the central philippines . according to u.s. navy documents , torpedo planes from u.s. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours . navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times , but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the musashi . `` she went down by the bow , capsizing when the forward flying -lrb- u.s. forecastle -rrb- deck was submerged , '' said the navy report , based on survivor accounts . two of those survivors , the executive officer and the chief engineer , told how they escaped the sinking . `` the executive officer swam off from one of the upper levels in the tower . he saw the propellers as musashi disappeared , '' the navy report said . `` the chief engineer climbed over the side amidships as musashi lurched to port . he walked and scrambled around the girth against the roll , climbing over the bilge keel . finally , he was thrown off into the water and swam away to port . there were no explosions . '' more than 1,000 of the musashi 's crew were killed during the battle and sinking . the 1,300-plus survivors were taken aboard by other japanese warships , according to the u.s. navy report . allen said that his superyacht , the my octopus , had found the wreck at a depth of around 1 kilometer -lrb- 3,281 feet -rrb- . a statement released by vulcan , allen 's company , said that the team combined historical data with advanced technology to narrow the search area , and that allen had `` commissioned a hypsometric bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to determine the terrain '' before searching the area with a bluefin autonomous underwater vehicle . kazushige todaka , the maritime museum director , said that , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was `` 90 % sure '' that the ship was the musashi . `` i was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down . i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true . '' todaka said allen 's team had been in contact with the museum about the ship 's potential location and its expedition . `` it 's a wonderful discovery , if it 's true , as we have long been looking for the battleship , '' he said . `` it 's fateful that the discovery was made on the 70th anniversary of -lrb- the end of -rrb- world war ii . the memory of the war has been fading away after 70 years , and the survivors of the war are disappearing . it is very meaningful discovery and a good chance for us to remind ourselves about the war and its tragedy . '' he added that images of the entire body of the ship will be needed to be 100 % sure that the discovery is indeed the musashi . the vulcan statement added that the team is `` mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the musashi as a war grave and intend to work with the japanese government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with japanese traditions . '' since leaving microsoft , the company he co-founded in 1975 , billionaire allen has immersed himself in a variety of commercial and charitable pursuits . he is the owner of several u.s. sports teams -- including the seattle seahawks -- and backed spaceshipone , the prototype commercial spaceplane that won the 2004 ansari x prize . his estimated net worth is $ 17.5 billion , according to forbes magazine . cnn 's brad lendon contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there seems to be an ever-growing list of people , places and things that will turn you gay . maybe we should think of these as the brigade of evil , homosexual nouns . there were the teletubbies and spongebob squarepants a decade ago . now , as these views thankfully get more fringe , the theories are becoming increasingly bizarre and awesome . among the homo nouns , there 's the common core , according to a florida lawmaker -lrb- education policy is super gay , obviously -rrb- ; taylor swift , who an op-ed writer for the christian post , larry tomczak , claims is being used by ellen degeneres to `` attract young girls '' to her show -lrb- uh-huh -rrb- ; the disney princess movie `` frozen , '' according to radio hosts in colorado -lrb- that dress ! -rrb- ; and now , according to a potential 2016 republican presidential contender , ben carson , there 's prison . yep , prison . stay away from crime , kids . turns ya gay . carson , who , let me reiterate , is a potential presidential candidate from a major american party , and a neurosurgeon to boot , told cnn 's chris cuomo in an interview that aired wednesday that `` a lot of people ... go into prison straight -- and when they come out , they 're gay . '' asked if being gay was a choice , carson replied in a word : `` absolutely . '' this level of ignorance is so last century , so near-irrelevant , that i 'm hesitant even to respond . but no one who holds these beliefs belongs in a race for the 2016 white house . ordinarily , i 'm the kind of gay person who likes to give people room to evolve . i know not everyone `` gets it '' automatically . that 's ok , as long as you are n't hateful about it , are willing to listen and do n't try to restrict the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people . i 'm from oklahoma , a deeply conservative state , and i 've seen friends , family and co-workers evolve . people who thought being gay was a sin -- or that it was a choice , or fixable -- now support same-sex marriage . people change . but presidential candidates do n't get that leeway . carson should know better . -lrb- in fact , he later apologized , regretting his words but saying the science on the issue of sexual orientation is n't clear . -rrb- . these views belong in another decade , not modern america . this apparently still needs to be said : being gay is not a choice . do n't believe me ? well , ask a gay person . as i mentioned , i 'm one of those -lrb- despite never having seen `` frozen '' in its entirety -rrb- , and i can tell you that , for me , it was n't a choice . it 's not something i would want to undo , but it also is n't like i woke up one day and was like , huh , you know what would really mix it up this winter ? dating dudes instead of ladies . science backs me on this . i 'm not going to roll through all the details , but mark joseph stern from slate sums it up pretty well : `` in study after study , biologists have found that homosexuality , at least in men , is clearly , undoubtedly , inarguably an inborn trait . '' and even if it were a choice , who cares ? a person 's religion is a choice . yet the united states offers certain protections based on religion . people still deserve rights . carson , meanwhile , opposes same-sex marriage . that 's a stance that , again , thankfully , is getting exceedingly rare in national politics . it 's also an issue that , along with transgender rights and employment discrimination against lgbt people , should be a focal point in the 2016 campaign cycle . i hope that america is evolved enough not to elect a candidate who opposes lgbt rights . i do think we live in that country these days . it 's a country that mostly laughs at someone saying prison would `` turn '' someone gay . but the point remains that saying so both belittles a serious issue of violence -- that of men raping other men in prison , which has nothing to do with turning anyone gay and everything to do with criminal activity . and it 's a serious lapse in logic . being around a bunch of dudes -- or ladies -- in prison does n't change a person 's innate sexual attractions . it 's so obvious i should n't have to say it . and the american people damn sure should n't have to listen to it . especially coming from a 2016 presidential contender , it 's almost laughably irrelevant . almost .
los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- federal agents on tuesday raided more than three dozen `` maternity hotels '' in southern california where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a u.s.-citizen baby , authorities said . the `` maternity tourism '' sites included apartment complexes in los angeles , orange and san bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said . those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from china , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement . those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said . authorities are looking for evidence of bringing in and harboring of undocumented visitors ; conspiracy , fraud and misuse of visas and permits ; tax evasion and false tax returns ; and willful failure to file report of foreign bank and financial accounts , court papers said . `` based on the results of the investigations to date , it appears the women pay cash for prenatal visits and the actual delivery , '' u.s. authorities said . `` as part of the package , clients were promised they would receive social security numbers and u.s. passports for their infants , which the mothers would take with them when they left the u.s. '' some of the packages included recreational trips to disneyland , shopping malls and even to a firing range , authorities said . `` any women encountered at the search locations will be interviewed and those identified as potential material witnesses will be directed when and where to report for further questioning , '' authorities said tuesday . investigators were n't expected tuesday to comment further on the outcome of the raids , said ice spokeswoman virginia kice . in all , authorities obtained warrants for 37 locations and ended up searching more than 50 sites , including consensual searches , kice said . the purported tourism businesses promoted themselves on the internet and through social media , authorities said . one firm in rancho cucamonga , california , advertised in chinese and branded itself as `` you win usa vacation resort . '' operators of that firm could n't be immediately reached for comment tuesday . chinese women have been flocking to the united states to give birth , lured because the country grants american citizenship to anyone born on u.s. soil , cnn money reported last month . that cnn money account was cited in an affidavit filed monday in a federal california court by homeland security investigation agent eric blair , who asked a judge for a warrant to search rancho cucamonga apartment buildings for large sums of cash and evidence of contraband and a crime . the judge granted the warrant . read one affidavit . `` perpetrators of visa fraud schemes typically charge $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 , which is a fee able to be paid by the wealthy in china , '' blair stated in court papers . in 2012 , about 10,000 chinese women gave birth in the united states , more than double the 4,200 in 2008 , according to chinese state media . blair alleged that the birthing houses `` will generally advise foreign national clients to fly to tourism points of entry such as hawaii or las vegas and to avoid traveling directly to los angeles international airport . this advice is due to heightened security by -lrb- u.s. customs and border protection -rrb- officials at lax based on the volume of fraudulent visas and false statements and entry documents that cpb officials have experienced over the last decade related to birth tourism . '' one operator of the alleged maternity tourism schemes in california was providing bank statements claiming he had monthly gross receipts of $ 213,968.79 and an annual income of $ 1,283,812.74 , blair said in court papers . those bank statements were provided by an internal revenue service special agent , blair said . many of the families want an american child because a foreign passport could be the family 's ticket out of china if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares . president xi jinping 's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich chinese yet another reason to be on edge . `` if things become economically or politically uncertain in one 's country of origin , the children have a place to come to , '' leti volpp , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley , told cnn money last month . the children can `` then sponsor their parents when they turn 21 , '' volpp said . the desire to leave china is especially pronounced among the wealthy . almost two-thirds of chinese with more than 10 million yuan -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- in the bank have emigrated , or are planning to , according to a hurun report released last year . one advertisement for a hacienda heights location `` claims that the apartments are extremely suitable for expectant mothers and their accompanying families , '' blair said in court documents . `` the apartment will allow expectant mothers to experience the american lifestyle during their stay . '' in an interview with cnn money in february , felicia he , 27 , said she paid tens of thousands of dollars to give birth in california . that interview occurred well before tuesday 's federal announcement of raids . `` i started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester , '' he said . `` i asked my friends who have given birth before in the u.s. for a doctor recommendation ; then i found a place to stay in the area for a few months , and purchased my plane ticket . '' he , who gave birth last year , said a u.s. passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities . foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in beijing , where she lives with her husband , and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college . there is one catch , though . getting a u.s. passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for u.s. taxes . cnn 's sophia yan in hong kong contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- samuel eto'o wanted to buy a watch . it was in london that he decided to purchase one particular model , one which cost $ 15,000 . for a former premier league footballer , a hero in his native cameroon , and one of the most successful african footballers of all time , the prospect of buying a watch was hardly the most daring of ordeals . so after taking a glance at the watch and getting out his credit card , he says he asked the sales assistant for some help . `` i asked the saleswoman -- who was also black like me -- ` could you show me that watch please ? ' `` first , i saw her turn and look at her coworkers like , ` uh , what should i do ? ' `` eventually , she let me see the watch . i looked at it and said , ` ok , i 'll buy it . ' `` i took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine , she came back and said that it was declined . `` i asked her , ` was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted ?

' '' eto'o , who played in london with chelsea last season , called his brother who was nearby and it was he who brought a new credit card so the transaction could be completed . while eto'o does speak english , his brother has a far wider vocabulary and was able to ask just what had occurred moments earlier . `` my brother can afford this and the way you 're treating him shows that you think just because he 's black , he ca n't afford this watch , '' said the sibling . eto'o then takes up the story , saying the lady in the store said she was wary of him because `` we had some nigerians in the store the other day who came with fake credit cards . '' `` if one of my own makes a mistake , they judge us all . tomorrow , if a white man in africa makes a mistake , we should judge all white people ? no ! `` the security guard from senegal kept trying to justify what the lady said and i asked him where he 's from . when he told me , i said , ` ahh . if i gave you my name , you will recognize who i am ? ' `` he shrugged and i said , ` i 'm eto'o . ' he went , ` nooooo ! just yesterday , my wife and i were talking about you ! can i take a picture with you and send it to my wife ? ' `` i said , ` yes , we can take a picture , but you made a mistake because you ca n't judge people by the color of their skin , ' so he told me it was n't because of our color . `` i told the lady , ` in my next interview , i 'm going to tell them about this and i 'll name the store so everyone can know that you treat people differently here , ' added eto'o referring to the saleswoman . `` she then realized that i could have reported what she had just done , but it was a mistake . it was a mistake of her to categorize . `` i do n't think she 's a racist person , but she stereotyped all black people as ` those people ' . '' eto'o tells this story to demonstrate his belief that racism is not just football 's problem but one that society as a whole must combat . the cameroon international has played across the world in england , italy , spain as well as a spell in russia with anzhi makhachkala . he says he has experienced racism on and off the field , most famously during his time playing for barcelona . in 2006 , during a game against real zaragoza , eto'o was subjected to `` monkey chants '' -- and the forward came close to walking off the pitch . he says it was only because of persuasion by his teammate fran that he stayed on and helped his side to a 2-0 victory . in 2010 , while playing for inter milan at cagliari , eto'o was again subjected to racist chanting which caused a three-minute stoppage to the contest . the referee addressed both captains while a message was also broadcast inside the stadium warning supporters the game would be abandoned if the chanting did not stop . eto'o went on to score the only goal of the game as inter triumphed 1-0 . `` you have to understand that football is just a reflection of what we have in society , '' said eto'o . `` it 's not that football is here and society is here -- no , it 's a reflection of what goes on in society . `` football is a great opportunity for certain people , who sometimes think they 're better than you or different than others , to express their views as right ... or as a chance to hurt other people . `` the first time i experienced racism was n't on a football pitch , but the truth is that i never thought that that could happen to me on a football pitch because football is a passion , it 's a feeling that touches millions of people . `` sometimes , the fact that you 're a footballer makes you think that racism ca n't happen to you because you bring that passion and you express a lot of things . `` when it happened to me , i could n't believe it and in that moment , i decided to walk off the pitch . '' eto'o , now 34 , believes there has been progress within the game in recent years and has decided that it is safe enough for his children to return to stadiums . in 2007 , he said he did not want his kids having to watch him being booed and subjected to racist abuse . `` i said that back then because racist incidents almost seemed to be fashionable , '' eto'o explains . `` when you arrive at a football ground , this is going to happen -- when there 's a black player , this will happen . `` in that moment , i said , ` no , my kids are n't going to go and see that because it will be very difficult to explain . ' `` if you tell a child , go to the right and you 'll get a reward , he 'll always go to the right because he wants the reward . a child comes to see his father play , have fun , make people happy and what does he see ? `` he sees people booing his father for being black , they make monkey noises , they throw bananas at his teammates and all that . `` but we see more and more that authorities are fighting , people are increasingly against what happens in football grounds and in society is getting better . '' eto'o was presented with the european medal of tolerance from the european council on tolerance and reconciliation following a ceremony in london earlier this week . for a man who has won three european champions league titles , his assertion that this particular award is his `` biggest '' gives an insight into eto'o 's mindset in dealing with the scourge of racism . `` it 's the most important , '' eto'o said of the award . `` it 's something that affects us all and to recognize the little work that i 've done , the truth is that i 'm very , very happy because you can win the champions league , you can win championships , you can score goals , but to represent a fight that affects millions and millions of people ... it 's one of a kind . '' eto'o also defended russia 's record of dealing with racism , despite fifa , the sport 's world governing body , expressing its concerns over how the country 's authorities deal with the problem . according to a report published earlier this month by the fare network , an anti-racism body , and the sova center , which conducts research on nationalism and racism , there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior within the russian game over two seasons . the fans of cska moscow , one of russia 's most famous clubs have been serial offenders in terms of racism with uefa , the game 's european governing body , handing out punishments on numerous occasions . yet , eto'o , now playing in italy with sampdoria , retains fond memories of russia . the four-time african player of the year joined anzhi in 2011 following a deal which made him the highest paid player in the world on a reported salary of $ 13 million a year . he scored 36 goals in 71 appearances before joining chelsea in 2013 -- but he rejects any suggestions that russia is a hotbed for racism ahead of the 2018 world cup . `` at the world cup in russia , you 'll see that there wo n't be incidents like this , '' he added . `` i hope there are n't because i 've played there and i had a great time there and i know the efforts that the russians are making to try to improve certain things that have happened there , and we have to support these efforts . `` football is beautiful . football is beautiful because whether you win , draw or lose , you can go and shake your opponent 's hand whether they 're white or black or red or blue . `` this is football . this is where football wins , but when there are incidents like this , it 's shameful , but it does n't mean this will happen in the world cup just because it 's in russia . `` i was there and i lived a beautiful experience .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a runway at new york 's laguardia airport reopened friday morning , a day after a delta air lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of flushing bay . runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar . it reopened at 10:30 a.m. et friday , according to ron marsico , a spokesman for the port authority of new york and new jersey . the delta plane slid off the runway thursday morning , with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters . delta flight 1086 briefly circled new york due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. thursday , passenger jared faellaci told cnn . almost as soon as it did , those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft 's wheels seemed to have little to no traction , sliding for about 20 seconds . `` you did n't feel the wheels take , '' faellaci said . then it was a matter of `` where we are going to end up , '' he said . about 4,500 to 5,000 feet down runway 13 , the md-88 veered to the left and mercifully stopped on a small embankment . a little farther , and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in flushing bay rather than on the airport 's snow-covered ground . contrary to what delta said in a statement , the aircraft 's slides did not deploy , according to port authority executive director patrick foye . still , with help from first responders , everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to laguardia 's delta terminal . video showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area . twenty-four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening . three of those were transported to nearby hospitals , the new york city fire department tweeted . faellaci said he was thankful for the plane 's crew , first responders and god that it was n't much worse . `` it was cause for a moment of prayer and a moment of reflection , as people were scared , '' he said . `` the pilot did a phenomenal job . '' the plane left a relatively balmy atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. laguardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later . before touching down , the plane 's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay . still , little prepared passengers for what happened . faellaci said he was reminded of the u.s. airways plane that landed in the hudson river in 2009 . all 155 people aboard that flight -- heading from laguardia to charlotte , north carolina -- famously survived thanks to the skills of pilot chesley `` sully '' sullenberger . the landing of delta flight 1086 was terrifying for many . `` there were people that were calm , there were people that were praying , there were people that obviously were frantic , there were people that were crying , '' faellaci said . jihad lateef , another passenger , was traveling with his brother . `` when the plane landed it was like me falling off of the top bunk -- did n't really know what was going on -- i just felt a hit , boom , '' he told cnn 's `` erin burnett outfront . '' `` i just prayed . '' the port authority chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before flight 1086 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported `` good braking '' action on runway 13 . still , that does n't mean the pilot did anything wrong . `` i think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down , '' foye said . `` obviously , the pilot and the co-pilot 's efforts were reflected in the fact there were only minor injuries . '' after the plane stopped , emotions ratcheted down some but not entirely . faellaci said there was some `` panic and shoving your way to the front '' to get off , though `` for the most part it was very orderly . '' passengers spent a few minutes standing in the snow -- carrying little more than their wallets and phones -- before buses took them into the warmth and comfort of the terminal . four minutes after the plane landed , all of laguardia airport shut down to air traffic . one of its two runways -- the one not involved in the incident -- reopened a few hours later . cnn 's shimon prokupecz contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- wednesday 's terrorist attack , which killed 23 people , hit tunisia where it hurt by targeting its flourishing tourism industry . the deadly attack on the prominent bardo museum near tunisia 's parliament in the country 's capital , tunis , is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death , a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years , including in north africa . such attacks mimic the 2008 mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from pakistan went on a rampage in the massive indian port city . they took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three-day period , in an attack that drew sustained global tv coverage . the gunmen attacked iconic mumbai targets such as the taj hotel , which is frequented by westerners . the mumbai gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a `` fedayeen '' mission -- meaning `` those who sacrifice themselves '' -- and that they would probably fight to the death . only one gunman survived . in this week 's tunisia attack , the gunmen took hostages , two gunmen died in the assault , and three survived and are being hunted by the tunisian government . tunisian prime minister habib essid said the attackers at the bardo museum had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country 's economy . this seems a likely outcome of the attack , as tourism is vital to tunisia 's economy , providing 15 % of gdp . tunisia is also the only country where the arab spring produced a successful , lasting democratic transition , making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like egypt , which did not weather the arab spring as well as tunisia . already , some tour companies are canceling excursions to tunis . in january , in tunisia 's neighbor libya , the local branch of isis mounted a similar attack on the upscale corinthia hotel in the capital , tripoli . two gunmen , one of them a tunisian , killed 10 people , including an american . both gunmen died in the attack . this attack served isis ' purposes of sowing greater instability in libya and expunging western influence from the country , as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed . a senior us official told one of us that the u.s. intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as isis now control a twelfth of the landmass of libya , which is one of the largest countries on the african continent . this is a sobering finding for tunisia , which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued libya and other north african countries . while the museum attack in tunisia and the hotel attack in libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals , more often than not , armed assaults by terrorists against so-called soft targets such as hotels , supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem . in september 2013 , al-shabaab , the somali al qaeda affiliate , killed 67 people in a fedayeen-style armed assault on the westgate mall in nairobi , kenya . four gunmen carried out the attack , which unspooled over a four-day period . the westgate attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the kenyan government , which had sent troops to somalia to fight al-shabaab . however , a year and a half after the attack on the mall , al-shabaab continues to lose territory in somalia , and the kenyan military has continued to battle the terrorist group . the plague of mumbai-style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to africa . in january , mumbai-style tactics were used in paris when cherif and said kouachi and amedy coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine charlie hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three-day period . all three gunmen were killed . in a videotape , coulibaly said isis inspired him . the paris attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on france 's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against isis .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- one-year-old viktoria lives almost entirely in the dark . she was born in donetsk , as the crisis in eastern ukraine was taking hold last year . now , she and her parents stay in a putrid cellar that also serves as a bomb shelter , on the outskirts of the city . they are usually packed in tight with dozens of other people . it takes torchlight to see their faces : children , women , men and the elderly , sitting in a sea of filth . there is no water and no toilet , just buckets overflowing in a space where people have to eat and sleep . this is the world viktoria has experienced so far , the place where she is having to learn to talk and walk . it 's an extraordinary contrast with just a few years before , when donetsk was a thriving city that helped host the european football championship . now the streets are empty and most of the shops are closed . the shelling is so incessant that our driver tells me it feels like having techno music playing constantly in the background . i hear a lot about the politics of the ukraine conflict : which leader has said what to whom , the provenance of arms , the big picture . what is missing from the debate is the people -- it is ordinary citizens who are suffering the most . behind the grand headlines , there are children in desperate need who are suffering now and who will continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis in years to come . around 1.7 million children are affected by the conflict in ukraine -- including more than a thousand who are seeking refuge in bomb shelters in donetsk . these are not modern bunkers . they are freezing holes , normally in the cellar of a house , which are simply unfit for human habitation . if a building collapses in a bombing , everyone will be buried . that is why in debaltseve , for example , aid organizations are bringing body bags with them . children are unbelievably stressed . they have seen friends and relatives die . they are afraid to even step outside of the cellars , as they fear they will never come back . on a recent u.n. aid convoy into donetsk , unicef delivered more than 27 metric tons of essential hygiene supplies , education kits and drinking water . we made sure we prioritized the neediest children -- those in underground bomb shelters as well as those who are living with disabilities , who have been orphaned or who are affected by hiv . but this is not the sort of childhood one would imagine for 21st century ukraine . in a country where children are too often institutionalized , the ongoing crisis can only exacerbate the problem . social systems are collapsing and children are bearing the brunt . in an orphanage for babies born to hiv-positive women , we found there were no tests to check if babies were hiv positive or not , let alone the necessary medication to treat them . these babies are in limbo -- nobody wants to adopt them and their status is not known . this area of ukraine had one of the highest level of hiv before the conflict began . now we just have no idea how bad the situation has become . elsewhere , we found children in detention in donetsk who had n't seen relatives in more than a year . in a center for children with disabilities , mothers told us they had no insulin for their diabetic sons and daughters . we have to help these children now , but also plan for when the fighting stops -- people will need new homes , and we 'll have to deal with unexploded ordnance and the terrible psychological damage on children , among other things . this is not a case of delivering aid now and that 's the end of the story . we need to commit for the long term . until then , though , the needs are huge and resources are scarce . in december , unicef called for additional support of $ 32.4 million to scale up its humanitarian response to address the urgent needs of children and families in conflict-affected areas in ukraine . today the needs are even greater . in the basement shelter , viktoria 's parents cradle her tightly . they ask me the same question again and again : `` when will it all be over ?

-lrb- cnn -rrb- israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's speech to the congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in tehran as it was in washington . the iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference . while some of netanyahu 's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the iranian state , the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to netanyahu 's baseless charge that iran 's vendetta against the jewish people is an ancient mission . the earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing netanyahu 's message to the american people . ali larijani , the powerful speaker of the iranian parliament , painted netanyahu as the leader of a `` tin pot regime '' that is not as concerned about iran 's nuclear program as it is of tehran 's growing regional influence . the hardline kayhan newspaper , the key official outlet linked to the office of iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , called the speech `` trash talking '' but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction . the paper , skeptical of president hassan rouhani 's nuclear negotiations with the americans from the beginning , said netanyahu 's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in tehran : the israeli leader and his american supporters are openly signaling the dispute with iran can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there . iranian media coverage of netanyahu 's speech mentioned the controversy in the u.s. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it . as one hardline newspaper , khorasan , put it , `` although it is undeniable that obama and netanyahu disagree on iran , the -lsb- recent -rsb- remarks of the two -lsb- leaders -rsb- shows that they both seek the same goal . '' the idea that the u.s. and israel share the same strategic goal to rein in iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners ' stance in tehran . the moderate outlets , supportive of president rouhani , have put a different spin on netanyahu 's speech . unlike the hardliners , they are not painting the obama-netanyahu fallout as some orchestrated good cop-bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from tehran . instead , they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the u.s. and israel . the moderate faction sees the controversy around netanyahu 's speech to the congress and his failure to squeeze the obama white house to toughen its negotiation terms with tehran as an indication that netanyahu is the one who is isolated . the hardliners and the moderates were in full agreement on one point , and that was the delight they shared about the absence of some 60 out of 232 democratic members of the congress from netanyahu 's speech . it is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary iranians to netanyahu 's speech . but one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary iranians outside the corridors of the state : his invocation of festival of purim , which commemorates the salvation of jewish people in ancient persia . the historic event is recorded in the book of esther but netanyahu 's characterization implied that the persian people 's history of anti-semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the jewish people is an ancient mission . `` today the jewish people face another attempt by yet another persian potentate to destroy us , '' netanyahu said . with that line , he put the ruling islamists in tehran on par with ruling persian empires that have come before them . as is already evident in the persian-language social media , this will not go down well with ordinary iranians , many of whom are not supporters of the islamist system in tehran and will resent the charge of eternal persian anti-semitism . they wish netanyahu had made more effort to distinguish between the islamist rulers in tehran -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-semitic views -- and the people of iran whose history with the jewish nation is far more amicable than netanyahu 's portrayal of history suggests . what is more instantly measurable is the impact of netanyahu 's speech among officials in tehran . the iranian response to netanyahu 's speech to the congress is best described as one that reflects the clash of visions between moderates and hardliners in the echelons of power . for the moderates , the controversy around his speech and the cold-shoulder netanyahu got from the white house is itself a vindication of president rouhani 's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to iran 's 12-year nuclear saga . the hardliners have been quick to paint netanyahu 's visit to washington as an example of the insincerity of the americans in dealing with iran , but not even the hawks in tehran are claiming that netanyahu 's presence in the u.s. congress is grounds to shift iran 's nuclear diplomatic strategy .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. ambassador to south korea , mark lippert , was attacked in seoul , and is in stable condition , receiving treatment at a local hospital , according to the u.s. embassy . according to seoul police , lippert was slashed on his right cheek and hand with a knife measuring about 10 inches long at 5:42 p.m. et on wednesday . a south korean news agency reported that the suspect was opposed to the joint south korea-u.s. military drills that launched earlier this week , but seoul police said the motive for the attack and how it was organized are under investigation . state department spokeswoman marie harf confirmed the ambassador had been attacked while giving a speech in seoul thursday morning , and said that the south korean embassy is coordinating with local law enforcement on the attack . `` we strongly condemn this act of violence . the ambassador is being treated at a local hospital . his injuries are not life threatening , '' she said . south korean president , park geun-hye condemned the attack : `` this incident is not only a physical attack on the u.s. ambassador , but an attack on the south korea-u.s. alliance and it can never be tolerated . '' she pledged a `` thorough investigation and strengthening '' of protection . lippert is a longtime friend and confidant of president barack obama , who has been a member of his inner circle since the president 's time as senator . according to national security council spokeswoman bernadette meehan , obama called lippert to wish him well . `` the president called u.s. ambassador to the republic of korea , mark lippert , to tell him that he and his wife robyn are in his thoughts and prayers , and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery , '' meehan said in a statement . according to local police chief yoon myung-seon , the event was organized by the korea council for reconciliation and cooperation , and the suspect in the attack was a member of the council . according to south korean news agency yonhap , the suspect is a 55-year-old man with the last name `` kim , '' who authorities say was opposed to the joint south korea-u.s. military drills that kicked off earlier this week . yonhap reported that the suspect came up from behind , pushed lippert down on a table and started attacking him . in july 2010 , kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a japanese ambassador to south korea , yonhap said . south korea 's ytn news channel reported that lippert was about to deliver a speech at a breakfast being held at sejong hall in seoul . the report says nothing specific about the attack , only that yelling was heard and then the bloodied ambassador was taken to the hospital . the suspect was reportedly detained and is currently under investigation . lippert has been close to obama ever since he arrived in the senate in 2005 . lippert worked with obama on the senate foreign relations committee and traveled the world with the senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign . when obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race , lippert was by his side again , and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the obama campaign . in 2007 , lippert was deployed as a naval reserve lieutenant to iraq to work as an intelligence officer with navy seals . a wall street journal profile of the diplomat published that year detailed an anecdote in which lippert received an email on his blackberry from then-sen . obama which read , `` i miss you , brother . '' lippert 's deployment was not without irony , because he was in iraq at a time when his boss was actively campaigning against what he said was a `` dumb war . '' after his deployment , lippert returned to washington and served as deputy national security adviser and chief of staff for the national security council in the obama white house . in october 2009 , however , he decided to return to active duty . he was deployed to afghanistan and he also served as an intelligence officer for the naval special warfare development group in virginia beach . `` he is a close friend , and i admire and respect his devotion to our country and answering the call to active duty service , '' obama said in a statement at the time . lippert was nominated to be the top asia policy official in the pentagon in 2011 , amid stories that he had clashed with former national security adviser , retired gen. james jones , while he served on the nsc . bob woodward reported in his book , `` obama 's wars , '' that jones resented lippert and another former senate aide denis mcdonough , who later was to become white house chief of staff , referring to them as part of the `` politburo '' who he thought thwarted the effective framing of policy . woodward reported in the book that obama affectionately referred to the two close aides by the dr. seuss nickname of `` thing one and thing two . '' obama nominated lippert to serve as ambassador to south korea last year . cnn 's barbara starr , jim acosta and paula hancocks contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the attack on mark lippert , the u.s. ambassador to south korea , allegedly by a knife-wielding korean progressive activist at a breakfast meeting in seoul , was a rare and shocking reminder of the ongoing conflict that continues to divide the korean peninsula . despite the ever-present backdrop of inter-korean tensions , security in downtown seoul is typically quite relaxed . but on thursday morning local time , the alleged assailant , who has been tied to korean nationalist and anti-u.s. protests , reportedly shouted his opposition to annual u.s.-south korean joint military exercises and called for korean reunification as he cut the ambassador on the face and hand with a 10-inch knife . this breakfast meeting with lippert was taking place at a building directly across the street from the u.s. embassy in seoul . and the scene was probably not too different from a similar breakfast meeting i attended with the ambassador at a downtown hotel only a week before the attack . lippert moved freely without a security detail or security screenings at the entrance to the venue , and was accompanied by only one or two embassy staff . indeed , even since 9/11 , it is relatively easy to enter most large buildings in downtown seoul , and security procedures have been generally perfunctory . in part this is because direct confrontations between south korean citizens and u.s. government representatives in south korea have been rare , and violent political attacks are unusual . true , there have been periodic group protests against the u.s. military presence in south korea or against u.s. policy . but these protests have generally been conducted peacefully , a far cry from the environment of the 1980s , when pro-democracy protesters against a then-authoritarian south korean government attacked and burned u.s. government facilities . yet although downtown seoul has been relatively safe and public security has often been lax , violent attacks on public figures in south korea are in fact not unprecedented . the attack on lippert brings to mind a may 2006 attack by a knife-wielding assailant on park geun-hye , south korea 's current president , while she was campaigning in local elections in daejeon . -lrb- her calm demeanor despite receiving a facial laceration contributed to her reputation as a politician and future president who is cool in the midst of a crisis . -rrb- . the attack on park was n't the only time the dangers inherent in south korea 's lax security environment have been exposed : back in 2008 , a lone arsonist burned to the ground seoul 's unguarded namdaemun , or south gate , a south korean cultural treasure . and of course , there is the backdrop of the ongoing inter-korean confrontation , which plays out within korean democracy in the form of a bitter confrontation between progressive and conservative factions . there is speculation that some members of south korea 's progressive movement have ties with north korea , and some of them have allegedly been somewhat willing to foment violence to stir up conflict within south korean society . most recently , some members of south korea 's left-leaning united progressive party , which had won seats in south korea 's national assembly , were disbarred and convicted of plotting a violent insurrection , leading to the dissolution of the party itself . and while this hard-core group represents a fringe element within south korean society , it still remains active in part due to north korean ideological and financial support . all this said , the overwhelming initial korean public response to the attack on lippert has been one of outrage , condemnation and sympathy . indeed , far from revealing gaps in the u.s.-south korea alliance or fomenting discord over whether joint military exercises should move forward , the incident is likely to strengthen south korean feelings of support for the alliance with the united states . still , the incident also serves as a reminder that even in the most seemingly safe and pro-american environments around the world , there is a risk that some zealous critics of u.s. policy may resort to violence against official u.s. representatives overseas . and that 's especially so in regions such as the korean peninsula , where longstanding tensions still cast a shadow over security considerations .

'' fortunately , sallans did n't have any health complications . but his experience left him with a mission . he volunteers to speak with medical institutions , as well as with businesses and colleges , to urge them to be more lgbt inclusive . while a growing number of medical schools are teaching future doctors how to address health concerns that can be specific to the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender communities , studies show current doctors only get about five hours of training , if they get any at all . the transgender life : what to know , say and understand . for members of the lgbt community who live in more rural and conservative areas like nebraska , the struggle to get good , or at least up-to-date , medical care may be even more difficult . in general , legal protections and institutional supports for lgbt nebraskans are already thin , spotty or nonexistent . on march 2 , the united states district court struck down nebraska 's ban on marriage for same-sex couples , but that ruling is on appeal . then there were 12 : nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . without the legal institution of marriage , lgbt nebraskans typically lack family health benefits , unless their employers provide them to same-sex partners . a 2014 study from the williams institute at the university of california los angeles found that states without lgbt legal protections in place see lower rates of health insurance coverage for lgbt residents than states with protections . that plays out in nebraska . a 2014 study from researchers at the university of nebraska omaha found that lgbt residents in the rural parts of the state have lower rates of health insurance coverage than their counterparts in urban areas . time to close hiv 's racial disparities . even when lgbt nebraskans have health insurance , they struggle to find providers versed in lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender heath care needs . research shows that lgbt individuals often experience health issues linked to being regular targets of discrimination or social stigma . discrimination has been linked to higher rates of substance abuse , suicide and stress-related illnesses , which can include heart problems , obesity , eating disorders and cancer . if the available doctors are not familiar with the increased rates of these issues , they may provide inadequate care . patients who find their doctors do not understand their issues may also delay treatment , often with bad health outcomes , said jay irwin , an assistant professor of sociology at the university of nebraska-omaha and a researcher in lgbt health . sometimes patients are turned away by providers who do n't want to treat lgbt patients , particularly if there are no laws to prohibit such discrimination . irwin has completed studies that focus on the health care challenges of lesbians in rural areas and found that many people feel isolated and are afraid to come out -- or risk discrimination in the medical office . supreme court same sex marriage decision could impact election . nebraska 's sheer size does n't help . sixteenth largest in the nation by geography , members of its lgbt community often live far from large cities with significant lgbt populations and with teaching hospitals with staff members who have experience working with members of that community . the human rights campaign 's 2014 healthcare equality index named four nebraska health care facilities , all in omaha , as leaders in lgbt health care equality . omaha is on the state 's eastern border with iowa . lgbt residents in western nebraska -- for instance , places like north platte -- have to travel 270 miles in either direction , to omaha or denver , colorado , to reach facilities designated as leaders by the human rights campaign . people who work within the health care system have seen some improvement when it comes to treating members of the lgbt community . jill young is the client services manager at nebraska aids project 's scottsbluff , nebraska , office in the western part of the state . she recalled when she started working there in the late 1990s she saw medical staff refuse care to lgbt people with hiv/aids . hiv deaths among african-americans drop 18 % , cdc says . `` we had nurses , for example , who said they would n't serve patients with hiv/aids , '' young said . `` but we 've come a long way since then . '' young has seen more hospitals in the region adopting policies that are supportive of lgbt residents , including one that just started recognizing same-sex partners ' wills as legal documents that will allow them access to their partners when they are being cared for in areas restricted to immediate family only . but she said she still sees too many lgbt residents traveling great distances to get care and she still sees too many patients who do n't seek medical care until it is too late . `` we still go to the hospital , '' she said , `` and see people who are days away from dying . '' eric yarwood , 44 , has more experience than he would like with nebraska 's health care facilities . he spent over 100 days last year at hospitals in omaha for complications related to germ cell cancer . he had nine rounds of chemotherapy , three stem cell transplants , his third surgery two weeks ago and five more days for followup last week . for all but four of the days he was in the hospital , his partner , aaron persen , 36 , was at his side every evening . `` aaron and i are a unit , '' yarwood said . `` i can count on my fingers the number of times he did n't come . '' while the couple has found the overwhelming majority of physicians and medical staff to be `` genuinely supportive '' of their relationship , there still were a few instances when they felt uncomfortable and unaccepted , once with a physician and another time with a nurse . `` i 'm not sure how often the medical staff works with gay couples or receives training on how to work with gay couples , '' yarwood said . same-sex marriage fast facts . yarwood 's prognosis is good , and the couple looks with optimism to a future of having more access to lgbt-inclusive health care facilities and a more inclusive state overall . `` hopefully , by the time we get through the cancer and save a little money , '' persen said , `` nebraska will follow most other states and allow our relationship to be legally recognized . ''
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his supporters are trying to create `` an atmosphere of hysteria '' and `` fear-mongering , '' the iranian foreign minister said thursday . `` the only explanation that you can have here is that some people consider peace and stability as an existential threat , '' javad zarif told cnn 's christiane amanpour . `` because a deal can not be threatening to anybody unless you want conflict and tension and mistrust and crises . '' in a highly controversial speech to the u.s. congress on tuesday , netanyahu said that far from stopping iran , the deal currently being negotiated in switzerland would pave iran 's way to nuclear weapons . zarif told amanpour that netanyahu 's speech had `` no effect on the negotiating table . '' he spoke from montreux , switzerland , where iran , the u.s. and five other countries are trying to hammer out an agreement that would trade sanctions relief for guarantees on iran 's nuclear program . zarif told amanpour that he believed negotiators were `` very close '' to such a deal , but only if everybody avoided `` the path of confrontation . '' `` everybody has to make tough choices . we have made the choice to engage in negotiations , although we believe that this entire exercise was unnecessary -- this was a manufactured crisis . '' `` people have been predicting for the past 20 years that iran was a year away from making a bomb , and that prediction has been proven wrong time and again , '' zarif said . `` but unfortunately that is a reality , that this hysteria that has been fanned continues to be fanned . and we try to resolve that problem . '' while the details of a definitive deal are still decidedly out of reach -- `` i 'm not prepared to negotiate on the air '' -- zarif told amanpour that he had hope for a `` win-win situation for all . '' `` the object of this exercise is to ensure that iran 's nuclear program will always remain peaceful , and to remove all the restrictions that have been imposed on iran , in our view unjustifiably , '' he said . `` you can either have sanctions and continue to seek that path of confrontation , or try to resolve this issue through negotiations and through an agreement . '' as iran negotiates its nuclear future , a war against isis is being waged in neighboring iraq . tehran has supplied the baghdad government with advisers , weapons , and ammunition , and one of its top generals , qassim sulaimani , has been sent to the country , according to the semiofficial iranian fars news agency . the pentagon has suggested that iranians could themselves be participating in the fight , which zarif denied . `` we do not have forces on the ground in iraq . we have always had advisers helping the iraqi government and the iraqi army , '' he said . `` we were the first to come to the assistance of the iraqis , both in baghdad as well as in irbil , when the isis started moving in in massive numbers last summer . '' `` everybody knows that without our assistance , things would have been different in iraq , '' he added . `` we hope that this could unite iraqis . '' the united states , which also has military advisers in iraq and has launched an air campaign against isis , adamantly denies that it coordinates with iran in the fight against their common enemy . `` this is a global threat , '' zarif said . `` you see the implications in europe , you see the fact that they are recruiting from europe . so this is a global problem , it requires global cooperation and global work .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- many years ago i performed at the surf ballroom , in clear lake , iowa , which was the last stop on buddy holly 's final tour . he was killed in a plane crash in 1959 that also took the lives of singers j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson and ritchie valens . by this time , buddy holly and i had had a pretty long history together . the concert that i performed at had all the old members of his group . donna , who ritchie valens wrote a song about , was also there . peggy sue , who buddy holly sang about , was there too . the picks were there -- they sang background vocals on buddy 's records -- as well as singer tommy allsup , who claimed that years later he got his wallet back from the crash site . unfortunately some fans at this show were selling crash-site photos , which i thought was in extremely bad taste . i think the prospect of the national transportation safety board delving into the crash again , which might mean exhuming bodies and all the rest , would be in similarly bad taste . i think there 's a reason we say , `` rest in peace . '' buddy holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died , because of his accomplishments which , in retrospect , nobody -- and i mean nobody , not the beatles the rolling stones or anyone else -- can beat , for these reasons : by the time he was 22 years old he had recorded some 50 tracks , most of which he had written himself and each of them , in my view and the view of many others , a hit . buddy holly and the crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed . no rock 'n' roll records can touch songs like `` rave on , '' `` think it over , '' `` not fade away , '' `` peggy sue '' and many , many more . he was also a sensitive , ballad composer and singer , which people often overlook , with songs like `` moondreams '' and `` true love ways , '' among many . as a paperboy , i cut open the stack of papers on february 3 , 1959 , and saw that buddy holly had been killed in the plane crash . the next day i went to school in shock , and guess what ? nobody cared . rock 'n roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 , nor had the others in the plane crash . americans in those days were always looking ahead . death was not lingered over . we 'd had enough of that in world war ii . death and grief did not go with the exuberance and bright colors of the 1950s . since then we have embarked on what i would call the `` american death trip . '' one simply has to look at the slew of autopsy shows on television and the endless regurgitation of marilyn , elvis and jfk death details to get my point . furthermore , because of the ever-growing psychological power of the media , we seem to think we can reach back half a century and touch things as if they are real . we live in a virtual nostalgic world because of this . fortunately , buddy holly 's music is forever young and all any young person has to do is listen to it and his life will be changed forever .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- diplomacy can be dangerous . u.s. diplomats have come under attack in various places in the last few decades . here 's a look at u.s. diplomats who have been killed in the line of duty . the first u.s. ambassador assassinated while in office was john gordon mein , the u.s. ambassador to guatemala . according to a telegram from the embassy in guatemala city , a young man dressed in fatigues and carrying a sub-machine gun on august 28 , 1968 , ordered mein 's vehicle to stop and for the ambassador to get out . he did , then ran -- prompting a cry of `` shoot him , kill him . '' mein was shot and fell to the ground about 12 yards behind his limousine . cleo noel jr. , the u.s. ambassador to sudan , was nearing the end of a march 1973 reception in the saudi embassy in khartoum when terrorists stormed in . the gunmen took noel and another american , as well as diplomats from saudi arabia , belgium and jordan , according to a u.s. intelligence memo . the captors ' demand : free various people , mostly palestinian guerillas , then imprisoned in jordan , israel and the united states . this spurred negotiations that did n't go anywhere , ending instead with the killing of noel , fellow u.s. diplomat george curtis moore and belgium 's charge d'affaires . u.s. authorities say the assailants belonged to the palestinian terrorist movement known as `` black september , '' claiming that palestinian leader yasser arafat signed off on the attack . ambassador rodger davies , who had been in cyprus for less than months , hunkered down in a hallway on august 19 , 1974 , hoping he was safe from those involved in a nearby demonstration . instead , a bullet penetrated the embassy compound and struck his heart , killing him instantly . antoinette varnava , a 31-year-old local who was part of the small embassy staff for about a decade , also died in the violence . u.s. ambassador to lebanon francis meloy , his economic counselor robert o. waring and their lebanese driver disappeared in june 1976 as they crossed the green line , the division between beirut 's christian and muslim sectors . their bullet-riddled bodies were found a short time later in mainly muslim west beirut , which was then controlled by plo chairman yasser arafat 's guerrillas . two former muslim guerillas were convicted in the kidnapping and killings , only to be freed in 1996 . about eight months after president jimmy carter appointed him as u.s. ambassador to afghanistan , adolph dubs was taken from his car while heading home from the embassy . his captors took the foreign service veteran to the hotel kabul , where dubs died in a shootout between captors and afghan police -- a violent death that , whomever fired the fatal bullets , the u.s. state department considers an assassination . a former eight-story hotel facing the sea transformed into america 's embassy in beirut turned into a war zone in april 1983 , when a truck loaded with explosives was rammed into its entrance . the result was horrific . offices were pancaked on top of each other , the elevator shaft and stairwell destroyed , the cafeteria full of bodies and rubble , recalled the then u.s. ambassador robert dillon , who himself was dug out of the rubble . while 44 people inside the embassy survived the blast , 17 americans , 25 foreign service nationals , 10 contract workers and 10 visa applicants and passerby did not . in 2008 , dillon said the attack was believed to have been carried out by a family `` under the direction of members of iran 's revolutionary guards . '' on august 7 , 1998 -- around the exact same time a bomb went off at the u.s. embassy in dar es salaam , tanzania , killing 11 -- a huge explosion tore through the u.s. embassy in nairobi , kenya . the american foreign service association -lrb- afsa -rrb- lists eight people as having died in the attack on its memorial remembering americans who died while serving the u.s. government abroad in a foreign affairs capacity . twelve americans total were killed . those are both jarring numbers , but they 're still a fraction of the more than 200 people total killed in the attack , in addition to more than 4,000 wounded . in may 2001 , a u.s. jury found four purported al qaeda members guilty on all charges stemming from the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania . as his wife of 34 years looked on , laurence foley was shot dead outside his home in amman , jordan , by a lone gunman in december 2002 . a public servant for close to 40 years , the boston-born foley was serving as executive officer of the usaid mission in amman at the time . u.s. officials were quick to label foley 's killing a murder , with the head of the afsa calling it a `` brutal terrorist attack . '' they later implicated iraqi-based terrorist leader abu musab al-zarqawi for providing `` financial and other support to the terrorists who assassinated '' foley . exactly 11 years after the september 11 attacks in new york , washington and rural pennsylvania , terrorists struck at americans again -- this time some 5,000 miles away in the libyan city of benghazi . that 's where ambassador christopher stevens was when mortar and rocket fire struck a u.s. diplomatic annex there . stevens did n't survive , nor did state department computer expert sean smith or tyrone woods and glen doherty , two former u.s. navy seals then acting as security contractors . the attack was first portrayed as violence by an angry mob responding to a video made in the u.s. that mocked islam and the prophet mohammed . but officials later determined that it was a terrorist attack . anne smedinghoff , a 25-year-old public diplomacy officer at the u.s. embassy in kabul , was delivering books to a school in southern afghanistan when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy . she died in that april 2013 attack , as did four others . `` we thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound , '' her father tom smedinghoff told cnn . `` but as it turned out , anne really wanted to do a lot more . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a florida man arrested in the united arab emirates for comments he posted on facebook said he 's sorry for his remarks . `` i said some pretty derogatory things that i do regret saying , '' ryan pate said . pate , who is a helicopter mechanic for global aerospace logistics , an aerospace company based in abu dhabi , was on vacation in florida when he was notified by the company that there would be `` steps taken against -lrb- him -rrb- due to a medical condition . '' the 30-year-old said he was on facebook when he got the news that his pay would be suspended , so he immediately expressed his anger there . `` i did slam them verbally , '' he said . `` i called them backstabbers . '' pate 's fiancee , jillian cardoza , said it was the `` perceived lack of sympathy from his company '' that `` embodied his comments that he made on facebook . '' when pate returned to the uae in february , he was was arrested for `` cyber slander against the uae and his employers , '' u.s. rep. david jolly , r-florida , said in a letter to secretary of state john kerry . `` the u.s. embassy in abu dhabi is in contact with -lrb- pate -rrb- and providing all possible consular assistance , '' state department spokesperson marie harf said . harf confirmed pate was arrested on february 16 and was released on bail on february 24 . pate said he did not insult the uae , the culture or islam , but cardoza said she understands her fiance 's comments were still `` offensive to not only the company he made them at , but in a larger sense the arab population . '' `` what i said was very wrong , '' pate said , `` i apologize for it . '' pate said the prosecutor has told him that he faces a fine , possible prison time and deportation if convicted . `` it really all rests on what the judge wants to do with with situation , '' pate said . pate 's next court appearance is scheduled for march 17 . cnn 's samira said and nick salter contributed to this report .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- britain needs more women as spies -- and it could do worse than look to recruit them on popular parenting website mumsnet . that 's according to a report released thursday by parliament 's intelligence and security committee . the report recommends targeting women , including mothers and those who are middle-aged or mid-career , to help break through `` the permafrost '' of men in middle management `` who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook . '' the idea that a new cohort of british spies could be signed up via mumsnet , more usually associated with debates on pregnancy , childcare and homemaking , may surprise some . but lawmaker hazel blears , a committee member , said recruiting more women to the three intelligence and security agencies the committee oversees is a crucial way to change the intelligence agencies ' sometimes hidebound culture . the current setup fosters `` a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative , collaborative approach , '' she said . but women 's life experience and other qualities should not be overlooked , she said . in a sign of the changing times , the latest film iteration of british spy james bond has had a female boss -- `` m , '' played by judi dench . but while women currently make up about 37 % of the employees across the uk intelligence agencies , according to the intelligence and security committee report , they make up fewer than one-fifth of those in senior roles . the recruiting idea has met with some amusement in the mumsnet community . `` if they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog-haired jumper and not noticing , i 'm their woman , '' posts one mumsnet user . `` i would love to be a spy . like actually love it . and no one would suspect me . i am too boring and frumpy , '' writes another . a third , more skeptical , comments : `` yes , people who ca n't help but type their every passing thought into an online forum would make great spies . '' besides using women-focused outlets like mumsnet to reach a new pool of talent , the committee recommends certain steps to make working for mi5 , mi6 and government communications headquarters -lrb- gchq -rrb- more tempting for women . these include offering better career management , encouraging women to set up their own informal support networks and not limiting their options if they have children . `` women who have successfully been filling operational roles must n't be sidelined after they have children . they still have the first class skills that the agencies helped them to build , so these should be used , '' blears said . former u.s. secretary of state madeleine albright -- who similarly looked into the position of women in the cia -- backed the uk report and what it said about the value of women in the intelligence agencies . `` diversity should be pursued -- not just on legal or ethical grounds , important as these are in their own right -- but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security , '' she said .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- mohammed emwazi , the british-kuwaiti isis fighter the world knows as `` jihadi john , '' was fuming with righteous indignation when he met with a representative of cage prisoners -- a muslim advocacy group now known as cage -- shortly after being deported from tanzania in august 2009 . in a meeting recorded by the advocacy group , he claimed his plans for a safari vacation were ruined when he was detained at the airport and sent back first to amsterdam and then to dover , england , where he was subjected to several interrogations by british security officials . he said they accused him of traveling to tanzania so he could link up with the terrorist group al-shabaab in neighboring somalia and revealed they had been listening in on his phone conversations even before he made the trip . emwazi said that during the questioning he denied any connection to extremism and stated that innocent people had been killed in the 2005 london transport system terrorist attacks and that the 9/11 terror attacks in the united states were wrong . father : no proof my son is ` jihadi john ' but more than a dozen british administrative court documents obtained by cnn paint a very different picture of emwazi and explain why he was on british security services ' radar before he made the trip . the documents reveal british security services believed emwazi was part of a radical west london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa . last week , two u.s. officials and two u.s. congressional sources confirmed to cnn that `` jihadi john '' is mohammed emwazi , a kuwaiti-born londoner . one figure in the group -- a 30-year-old british-iranian identified only as `` ce '' who was allegedly trained by al qaeda terrorists in somalia in 2006 -- was later placed under a `` control order , '' a british administrative measure to restrict the freedom of movement of terror suspects . a december 2011 court document pertaining to ce 's case named emwazi as part of his extremist network . according to the document , british home secretary theresa may `` maintained she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that since his return to the united kingdom in february 2007 , ce has continued to associate regularly with members of a network of united kingdom and east african-based islamist extremists which is involved in the provision of funds and equipment to somalia for terrorism-related purposes and the facilitation of individuals ' travel from the united kingdom to somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity . the secretary of state maintains that members of the network include bx , j1 , mohammed ezzouek , hamza chentouf , mohammed emwazi , mohammed mekki , mohammed miah , ahmed hagi , amin addala , aydarus elmi , sammy al-nagheeb , bilal berjawi and others . '' some of these men are now dead . others are wanted . ce told british officials that mekki and emwazi often stopped by his wife 's apartment . several of the visits were in early 2011 , according to the document . many of the young men in this network grew up within a few blocks of emwazi in west london . according to the court documents , security services believe five members of the group -- ce , berjawi , bx , ezzouek , miah and chentouf -- attended an al qaeda training camp in somalia in 2006 in which they may have been instructed in the use of explosives . the camp was run by two veteran al qaeda operatives , saleh nabhan and fazul mohammed , who instructed the british group to return to the united kingdom `` to carry out facilitation activities and to recruit individuals to work on behalf of al qaeda and/or al-shabaab , '' according to the british government . nabhan and fazul mohammed were the most-wanted al qaeda operatives in africa and , according to a 2009 u.s. state department cable , their training camps offered far more advanced instruction than that offered by al-shabaab . nabhan , a kenyan operative , was suspected of playing a key operational role in the bombing of the u.s. embassy in nairobi , kenya , in 1998 , as well as a bomb attack on a resort in mombasa in 2002 , and on the same day , a failed missile attack on an israeli airliner taking off from mombasa 's airport . fazul mohammed , who was born on the comoros islands , was also suspected of playing a key role in the bombings of u.s. embassies in east africa in 1998 . he wrote in a 2009 memoir that western recruits should be provided with training rather than instantly dispatched as suicide bombers within somalia `` to build sleeping cells around the world . '' nabhan was killed in a u.s. navy seal raid in september 2009 and fazul mohammed was killed in an ambush in mogadishu in june 2011 . authorities recovered a document on a thumb drive found on his body -- probably authored by a british recruit -- proposing an attack on targets including eton college and the five-star dorchester and ritz hotels in the united kingdom , similar to the 2008 mumbai , india , attacks that killed more than 160 people . the author proposed two months ' training in somalia for british and western recruits selected for the attack , including target reconnaissance , hostage-taking , weapons and counter-surveillance . according to the court documents , at least one member of emwazi 's circle -- j1 , a 36-year-old ethiopian asylum seeker to the united kingdom -- had links to the al qaeda cell that attempted to bomb the london transport system on july 21 , 2005 , two weeks after bomb blasts on london underground trains and buses killed 52 people and wounded 770 . according to the british government , j1 , a christian convert to islam known in islamist circles as abdul shakur , contacted bomber hussain osman by phone on the morning of the july 21 attempted attack . in october 2009 , two months after emwazi 's alleged aborted attempt to wage jihad possibly in somalia , three members of his west london network -- bilal berjawi , mohammed sakr and walla eldin rahman -- traveled to join the terrorist group al-shabaab in somalia , according to the documents . british security officials estimate that a total of more than 100 british extremists traveled to join the group , according to published reports . the lebanese-born berjawi , from st. john 's wood in west london , swiftly rose to a senior position in al-shabaab and likely continued to work closely with the senior al qaeda operative fazul mohammed , according to a profile by raffaello pantucci , the director of international security studies at the royal united services institute . according to the uk court documents , berjawi remained in contact with the radical network he and emwazi belonged to in the united kingdom while in somalia . berjawi and sakr were killed in u.s. drone strikes in early 2012 . it is possible one of them authored the blueprint for attacks on luxury london hotels found on fazul mohammed 's body in mogadishu the previous year . by 2013 , emwazi 's west london radical network had a new cause célèbre : the jihad against the assad regime in syria . drone strikes and infighting in al-shabaab had made life increasingly difficult for foreign fighters in somalia . two members of emwazi 's network managed to leave britain despite being under `` terrorism prevention and investigation measures '' -lrb- tpims -rrb- , which means the monitoring of terror suspects who ca n't be charged . their current whereabouts are unknown , but one possibility is that they traveled to syria . tpims were introduced by the british coalition government in 2012 to replace the previous control order system . according to robin simcox , a research fellow at the henry jackson society who has conducted extensive research on control orders , the new system removed authorities ' power to relocate terror suspects , making it easier for them to re-engage with their radical networks . both of emwazi 's associates moved back to london and then fled the country . ibrahim magag -- a british-somali man previously identified as `` bx '' under the control order regime -- fled in december 2012 after using scissors to cut through the strap of his gps location monitoring device . british authorities believe he hailed a london taxi , and disappeared . he had previously attended the training camp run by the senior al qaeda operatives nabhan and fazul mohammed in somalia in 2006 and was involved in fund-raising for al qaeda in east africa , according to the court documents . in 2010 , prior to the introduction of tpims , a british judge had ruled he was `` too dangerous to allow him to be in london for even a short period . '' nevertheless , the british secretary of state wrote in court documents that `` magag is not considered to represent a direct threat to the british public . the tpims notice in this case was intended primarily to prevent fund-raising and overseas travel . '' his whereabouts today ? unknown . mohammed mohamed -- a somali-born radical previously identified as `` cc '' -- went on the run in november 2013 after entering a west london mosque and removing his gps monitoring device . security cameras captured him leaving the mosque , disguised as a woman wearing a burqa . in 2008 , mohamed had traveled to somalia , where al-shabaab provided him terrorist training . he was detained in somaliland in 2011 and deported to the uk . according to the court documents , he was involved in facilitating travel for others to somalia and fund-raising for al-shabaab , and was planning attacks potentially against western interests in somaliland before his arrest . he remains wanted by british security . it 's unknown if magag or mohamed rekindled their ties with emwazi in london before leaving the country . in 2013 , emwazi himself traveled to syria , joined isis , and began guarding western hostages . in august 2014 he was dubbed `` jihadi john '' -- the menacing , taunting , hooded face of isis -- when he orchestrated the brutal beheading of american journalist james foley , the first of many victims murdered on camera .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- how do republicans try to breathe new life into an old scandal ? we 've seen it time and time again . here 's how it works : . step one : republicans , with nothing in their arsenal to use against hillary clinton , selectively leak to reporters a `` scandalous '' tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported . step two : the new media bites . step three : the media hyperventilates and suffocates the airwaves with repetition of the same story . step four : upon further examination , the story falls apart . this is exactly how the latest media hype , this time over hillary clinton 's use of emails at the state department , has played out . and it presents yet another chapter in the benghazi hoax . the new york times story about hillary clinton 's use of a private email account at the state department is a perfect example of `` gotcha '' journalism , where reporters will take any bait the republicans give them without proper vetting . the new york times has a history of this . -lrb- whitewater , anyone ? -rrb- . the times story suggests secretary clinton broke federal rules in relation to her email . but the times ' main source for this allegation says clinton violated no laws . yes , clinton used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state . but so did secretaries of state before her . according to the state department spokesman marie harf , john kerry is the first secretary of state ever to rely primarily on official state department email . clinton asks state to release emails : what you need to know . in october 2014 , 18 months after clinton left , the state department was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies . the state department asked every secretary of state dating back to madeleine albright to provide records , including emails , from their time in office . clinton responded to the state department 's request for emails , providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails . she did so months ago . clinton has been fully transparent and has asked the state department for these emails to be made public . republican investigators seeking to hype the current benghazi investigation leaked the issue to keep a dying investigation alive . and once again , reporters bit . in the days since the new york times posted its story , there have been dozens and dozens of stories written on the topic . why ? because the clintons are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny . their perfectly usual , above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while republicans are left relatively unscathed . mitt romney used his private email account to discuss political business , and when he left the governor 's office , his administration destroyed records rather than turn them over to state archives . scott walker 's county executive 's office used a secret email system , which investigators determined was being used to engage in campaign work on county time and to avoid public records disclosure laws . mike huckabee 's office had files , including emails , cleaned and physically destroyed , including `` travel records , calendars , call logs , and emails . '' why has n't their behavior been scrutinized over and over again ? because their last name is n't clinton . in the end , all we are left with is the benign fact that hillary clinton used a personal email account at the state department . this is n't even a revelation -- it has been known for years . looks like the republicans wasted their breath , once again , for nothing .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- do n't bogart that spoon , man . lem me get a hit off that cone , dude . pass the bowl ... of ice cream ? could ben and jerry 's , the counterculture snack empire gone mainstream , be planning a marijuana-infused ice cream ? `` makes sense to me . you know , combine your pleasures , '' co-founder ben cohen said in an interview with huffpost live that 's been buzzing among marijuana aficionados since it aired last month . like attitudes about marijuana itself , the story went mainstream this week . it makes some sense . co-founder jerry greenfield noted that the duo has some experience with , uh , substances . and the company already gives a nod to the marijuana culture with flavor names such as `` half baked . '' marijuana is becoming more mainstream , too . four states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana , and attitudes nationwide have been changing in favor of pot , which remains banned by federal law . in january 2014 , a cnn/orc poll found that 55 % of americans favored the legalization of marijuana . only 16 % thought that in 1987 , cnn reported at the time . in colorado , where recreational marijuana use is legal under state law , edibles containing weed now make up nearly half the market for pot products , according to the denver post . alas , pot fans , cohen and greenfield no longer control the company . they sold it to unilever inc. for $ 326 million in 2000 . `` if it were my decision , i 'd be doing it , '' greenfield told huffpost live . `` but fortunately , we have wiser heads at the company that figure those things out . '' a spokeswoman for the company told adweek magazine that there are n't any current plans for pot ice cream , but she left the door open to the possibility . `` ben & jerry 's has n't given serious consideration to the possibility of cannabis-infused ice cream , '' spokeswoman kelly mohr told adweek . `` perhaps it 's high time .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- all you need is luck , to misquote one of liverpool 's most famous exports , the beatles . but liverpool 's footballers wo n't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at swansea to set up a pivotal clash with manchester united at the weekend . one of english soccer 's biggest rivalries is renewed on sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season 's european champions league . jordan henderson knew little about his winner in wales , the ball flying in after jordi amat 's clearance struck him , but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the reds . a sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of manchester united in fourth , with just four points separating liverpool from manchester city in second . `` it 's a great result , '' henderson told sky sports . `` the first half was disappointing but i felt as though we did better in second half , passed the ball and created a few chances . `` it was a great pass by daniel , i got a little fortunate with the finish but you 've got to be in the right position to score . `` overall we 're delighted with three points and we now look forward to sunday . we ca n't wait for it , we are high on confidence and have great momentum but united played well the other day . `` it 'll be a tough one but at anfield we go in confident and hopefully we 'll get the result we need . '' in a lackluster start , daniel sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for liverpool before england international adam lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at swansea goalkeeper lukasz fabianski . from then on swansea asserted control . martin skrtel had to be alert to clear as swansea 's french striker bafetimbi gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal . gomis then played a neat one-two with wayne routledge before forcing liverpool goalkeeper simon mignolet into a fine low save . next to threaten liverpool 's net was iceland international gylfi sigurdsson , whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before mignolet intervened . just before halftime jonjo shelvey , a former liverpool player , went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by alberto moreno . but having had a chance to regroup , liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot . first fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out philippe coutinho 's near post effort before the pole was then in action again to deny joe allen . though liverpool were in the ascendency , its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck . as henderson galloped onto a through ball swansea 's spanish defender amat got there first , but his clearance ricocheted off the liverpool player and into the net past fabianski . from then on liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter , striker daniel sturridge hitting the post late on as swansea left gaps at the back . reading seal wembley berth . in the fa cup -- england 's premier cup competition -- second tier reading sealed a trip to wembley to face arsenal in the final four after beating bradford 3-0 . goals from hal robson-kanu and garath mccleary inside nine minutes punished third tier bradford , before jamie mackie added a third in the closing stages . reading will face arsenal in april while the other semifinal sees aston villa play either liverpool or blackburn , who meet in a replay .
boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- she knew something awful had happened . it was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams . her foot was turned sideways and her legs would n't work right . and her good friend , krystle campbell , was just lying there on the ground . karen rand -- she 's karen mcwatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement . she wanted to get closer to krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos . `` i got close to her , '' she recalled . `` for some reason , i got close to her head and we put our faces together . '' krystle said that her legs hurt . they were the last words she 'd speak . the two women held hands until krystle 's went limp . mcwatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev , who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the united states for policies they believe inflict suffering on muslims . three people were killed in the blasts : campbell , a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain ; martin richard , an 8-year-old boy ; and lingzi lu , a 23-year-old grad student . more than 250 others were injured . and the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack , who recounted in detail the chaos of that day . prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted . tsarnaev 's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors . mcwatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people . their two faces , side by side , stand out among the jumble of limbs . krystle 's mouth is open , but she is very pale . `` i was really scared , '' mcwatters testified , `` and i remember screaming for someone to help us . everybody was screaming , everybody was screaming for help . it seemed like a long time before help got to us , but it probably was n't . '' by the time first responders reached krystle , it was too late . `` they were doing cpr on krystle and i started to think she did n't make it , '' mcwatters said . she grabbed her friend 's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket . by the time she arrived at the hospital , shock had set in . she was confused . for a while , that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was krystle campbell . when krystle 's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she was n't their daughter , they were heartbroken , mcwatters said . krystle 's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents . two days later , doctors told her they were taking her leg . her body was broken , and it hurt like crazy , she said . but not as much as losing her friend . campbell 's death was the first to be described in detail at tsarnaev 's trial . but descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the massachusetts institute of technology will come soon . there were runners conquering a 26.2-mile feat nearby , but noah 's attention was elsewhere , playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist . the 5-year-old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks , his mother , rebekah gregory , told jurors . gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that noah was happy playing scientist . the next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back . other witnesses used similar phrases : blown through the air , deafening explosion , cries for help . shane o'hara , the manager at marathon sports , a running store near where the bombs went off , said it sounded like a loud cannon , followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows . o'hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair . the decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him , he said . there were cries , sirens and screams , he said in answer to prosecutors ' questions . he sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the courtroom . he told the jury the plea he heard : `` stay with me , stay with me . '' outside , gregory tried to sit up , but could not rise much . `` my first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby , where was my son , '' gregory said . she could n't see her legs , but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk , she testified . `` at that point i thought that was the day i would die , '' she said . gregory lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh . somehow , over the cacophony , she heard noah calling for her . she was n't imagining it . colton kilgore , who was also part of gregory 's group and another of wednesday 's witnesses , remembered the terrified boy looking for his mother . boston marathon bombing timeline . the day 's testimony was dramatic and emotional , most likely as the prosecutors wanted it . anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened . the power of the survivors ' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real . they shared small memories , like what people said in the immediate aftermath of the attack . gregory told the jury about how she knew noah was being cared for . then she focused on the tourniquet that was being twisted on her leg by aid-givers . `` we have an amputee , '' she saw one of them mouth . what they told her aloud was something along the lines of `` this is really , really bad , but we will help you . '' another survivor , sydney corcoran , testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing `` just like leaving a concert '' -- she was hurt but did n't know that she was severely injured . she limped to a railing , grabbed it , and passed out , she said . eyes open again shortly afterward , she found herself on her back , with a group of men applying pressure on her thigh , trying to figure out where she was bleeding . `` i remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me i 'd be all right , '' she said . corcoran was a senior in high school . after the one man told her she would be ok , another said he could see her eyes going white . `` i could feel my body going tingly and i was getting increasingly cold . i knew i was dying , '' she testified . in court , she was asked if she knew why she was feeling cold . `` i was dying . the blood was leaving my body . i was bleeding out , '' she answered . it felt like she was sliding into sleep . almost peaceful , corcoran said . like she was going to go to sleep and fade away . doctors saved the teen , but her life was not spared the pain of the attack . corcoran awoke in a hospital and saw her father , she testified . because she was intubated , she motioned for a pen and a paper and wrote a question for her father . was her mother alive ? `` once he looked at what i 'd written he started to cry , '' corcoran told jurors . the father responded : `` she 's ok , but her legs are gone .

hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- disgraced former people 's liberation army -lrb- pla -rrb- general xu caihou has died of bladder cancer , chinese state media has reported . he was 71 . xu , who passed away at a hospital on sunday , became one of the highest-profile figures in china 's military to be caught up in president xi jinping 's war on corruption last year , when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations . the court decided not to prosecute xu due to his illness , but said his illegal income , including the bribes he was determined to have accepted would be handled in accordance with the law . formerly a vice-chairman of china 's central military commission , the body which runs the two-million strong pla , xu was also expelled from the chinese communist party and had his rank of general revoked , according to a statement from the state-run xinhua news agency . a seven-month investigation , which began in march last year , found that xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people . he confessed to accepting bribes personally and through his family . he was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members . the amount he received was `` extremely huge , '' the statement added . in chinese president xi jinping 's annual new year speech , he reiterated china 's `` zero-tolerance '' stance towards corruption , vowing to keep `` waving high the sword against corruption '' and `` fastening the cage of regulations . '' 2014 saw xi take down two top officials in china 's fight against corruption , in addition to xu . he took down former domestic security czar zhou yongkang , likely soon to become the most senior chinese official ever to face corruption charges , and ling jihua , a top aide to ex-president hu jintao . state media have touted the trio as the three biggest `` tigers '' caught in xi 's now-two year old anti-graft campaign , which has a stated goal of targeting both `` tigers and flies '' -- high-and low-ranking officials .
orlando , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- kaka grins as he recalls being mobbed by a boisterous crowd chanting his name at a florida airport arrivals hall in the early summer of 2014 . `` it was very nice ... a good surprise for me , '' he said , wistfully casting his mind back to images of football fans waving flags and hollering his name . the graceful brazilian midfielder once of sao paulo , ac milan and real madrid has become used to such fevered adulation over the years . a glittering decade playing in europe brought champions leagues , scudettos , la liga titles and , of course , a devoted following . but it was n't the loyal apostles of madrid 's ultras sur , the curva sud milano or even his compatriots in the unmistakeable yellow of a selecao with whom he won a world cup in 2002 that provided the heroes welcome in question . instead it was a passionate crowd festooned in the less heralded purple and white of orlando city , one of the newest franchises in major league soccer . only founded in 2010 , the team will make its mls bow this week . but interest was high that a former ballon d'or winner would be coming to play his football in a place more commonly associated with disney world and universal studios . local news stations carried live pictures of kaka 's plane touching down . leaving the airport to officially sign his contract even became a mission in itself , so keen were the orlando natives to get a glimpse of their first designated signing . `` when i arrived in the airport , this crowd -lrb- was -rrb- singing the team songs , singing my name . also -lrb- at -rrb- my presentation downtown , i was very , very happy , '' kaka said . `` now , the city is start -lrb- ing -rrb- to enjoy this moment and everybody 's looking forward to our , first game on march 8 . '' such frenzied devotion in the u.s. , so long resistant to the charms of the world 's most popular sport , may seem strange to fans in europe and south america , football 's historical and cultural heartlands . the mls is now approaching its 20th season but has long been pejoratively regarded outside north america as a retirement home for once top-level players -- a plastic , commercially driven product devoid of any real identity offering one last payday before the limbs give out . aged 32 and no doubt the recipient of a handsome remuneration package , there will be many who question whether kaka is merely jetting in to boost his bank balance before calling it a day . relaxed and polite as ever , kaka himself is having none of this . in all honesty , it 's hard to imagine a man as conscientious and clearly committed to his faith moving anywhere solely for the money . there was once a time when every kaka goal resulted in a lifting of his jersey to reveal a t-shirt which stated `` jesus loves you '' or `` i belong to jesus . '' these days , the celebration of choice is usually the upward point and grateful look to the heavens . `` in every moment of my life , not just on the field , but also off the field , my faith , jesus christ and the bible helped me a lot . `` so every time that i can i do my prayer , i read the bible , go to the church . these things help me a lot to stay in good peace on my mind . '' his faith was never more important than as an 18-year-old in sao paulo when he suffered a serious neck injury . `` all the doctors said look you are lucky to walk in this moment , so you need to be happy you can walk , '' he said . `` and my question was ` but i can play ? ' everybody said ` we do n't know , we have to wait . ' so , in that moment , the faith helped me a lot . `` god always supported me at every moment and after two months i start to play as a professional player . it was a very important moment of my life . '' talking of moments , kaka describes how moving to the u.s. was always a long-term ambition . upon meeting orlando city majority owner flavio augusto da silva in brazil a number of years ago , the pair discussed the potential of working together . moves to la galaxy and new york red bulls were mooted in the interim but never materialized for various reasons . it was then the orlando opportunity arose which he was only too happy to take . kaka points to other high-profile players like steven gerrard , frank lampard , david villa and sebastian giovinco being attracted to the league as proof of its appeal and progress . `` there 's a lot of good players that could have another team in europe but they chose to come here . i think it 's a good moment to be in this league . in a few years , we will listen a lot about the mls , '' he said . he might just have a point . the forthcoming mls season marks the first of a new eight-year tv deal and media rights partnership with espn , fox sports and univision . on top of this , average attendance across the league for the 2014 season was the highest in recent mls history , according to data on the mls attendance blog . yet questions remain over the long-term profitability of some teams . a report from forbes magazine in late 2013 found only 10 out of 19 mls franchises were making any money . critics might also argue that the players mentioned by kaka are past their very best with the possible exception of the 28-year-old giovinco . unsurprisingly , the former fifa world player of the year does n't see it that we way . he reveals he still harbors ambitions of continuing his international career and even making the world cup in russia 2018 . last october saw a surprise recall under returning brazil manager , dunga . `` i have a three-year contract with orlando , and at least these three . in four years , we have another world cup , '' said kaka , who will be 36 in 2018 . '' if i feel good and brazil needs me -lrb- it -rrb- will be a good way to stop playing . so i hope i can play another world cup . '' just mentioning the world cup in the presence of a brazilian can be tense after the trauma of last year 's incredible semifinal in belo horizonte . the 7-1 home-turf mauling at the hands of eventual winners germany was variously described in the unforgiving brazilian press at the time as `` an historic humiliation '' and the `` humiliation of all humiliations . '' never before has a brazilian side looked so inept , so fragile , so lacking in class , flair or bereft of that ephemeral quality known locally as `` joga bonito . '' `` that was very hard for us , '' said kaka even though he was n't selected for the tournament . `` that defeat in our country , in the semifinal world cup it 's very , very difficult . but i think we can use this to change some in the brazilian football . `` a lot of players play outside -lrb- of brazil -rrb- . most of them play in europe , but we have to change something organization in the soccer in brazil . `` for me , the most important thing is the organization and the calendar . it 's a lot of games , so the players ca n't play every game in a good shape . `` the level is a little bit down in this moment . also , the youth team is not what -lrb- we 're -rrb- used to being in brazil , so we need to wake up . '' kaka hopes that many of his compatriots will keep up with the mls and his career in orlando now that he 's exhibiting his much admired talents there . `` we have a facebook page in brazil , orlando city brazil , and a lot of fans -lrb- are -rrb- enjoying the page . a lot of brazilians are looking here now , '' he said . `` i think this season will be great for us in brazil . a lot of people will see the orlando city playing in mls . '' and despite earlier talk of an extended international career and making world cup 2018 , there really is only one goal at the forefront of his mind . `` my goal is always to win . i hope one day i can win the league with orlando city , '' he said . `` for this year , probably we want to arrive in the playoffs . let 's put the target a little bit down , but i still have ... this goal that we can win the league one day . ''
moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- ever since vladimir putin came to power , there have been killings of politicians , of human rights activists , of journalists . boris nemtsov , one of russia 's most prominent opposition figures , is only the latest victim . the key thing all these crimes have in common is that none of them get properly resolved . of course , the kremlin will issue condemnation and condolences , as it has done over the assassination of nemtsov . but the killers and the people who ordered the killings do n't usually end up facing justice -- and if you are an opposition politician in russia , or a human rights activist , or a journalist , you will know this . if the dangers were n't clear enough , the circumstances of the most recent killing are a stark reminder . it was late friday night . boris nemtsov and his girlfriend anna duritskaya , a ukrainian model , had eaten dinner at plush restaurant on red square . afterwards , despite the chilly weather , they decided to walk back to his apartment , perhaps to take in the stunning views . the kremlin looks spectacular at night . it was on this short journey , in the heart of moscow , that the gunman struck , leaving nemtsov dead within sight of the red kremlin walls -- walls which , by the way , bristle with security cameras . in the days since , thousands have made pilgrimage to the place where the outspoken putin critic was shot to pay their respects , leaving a mountain of flowers and personal messages . an opposition rally on sunday , which nemtsov was meant to lead , was canceled and replaced with a mourning march past the crime scene . it was the biggest pro-opposition rally in the russian capital for years . but few who took part could have missed the symbolism , the real message the killers -- whoever they are -- sent by gunning down such a prominent kremlin critic in the shadow of its towering walls . it 's this : if you oppose the kremlin , if you criticize its power , if you stand for greater democracy and reform , as boris nemtsov did , this could happen to you too . it 's hard to predict what impact this message will have . `` yet another terrible page has been turned in the history we all share , '' wrote mikhail khodorkovsky , the once-jailed oligarch-turned kremlin critic now in exile . `` what the next page holds is up to each and every one of us , '' he said , commenting on the death of nemtsov . the statement was issued under the banner `` we are not afraid '' . but many russians i 've spoken to since the killing are , in fact , very afraid . and while the hope among opposition activists is that nemtsov 's killing may at least invigorate their ranks , one very real possibility is that it will do the exact opposite : further silence an already very quiet minority opposed to the rule of vladimir putin .
atlanta -lrb- cnn -rrb- a suburban atlanta police officer is dead after an apparent ambush , while his colleague 's life was spared by his radio . fulton county police officer terence green , 48 , was killed wednesday in fairburn , georgia . a second officer was shot in the hip , but suffered no injuries . `` it was actually his radio -- the bullet went through -- the radio saved him . it penetrated the radio , '' said fulton police chief cassandra jones . the incident occurred when police were searching a neighborhood after reports of gunfire from the home of amanuel menghesha , 42 . menghesha allegedly fired at the officers without warning , authorities said . he `` appeared to have gone on a rampage , '' said fulton county assistant chief gary stiles , who described it as an `` ambush . '' police said the officers were shot with an `` assault style rifle . '' menghesha was then shot by other officers . green was shot in the head and died at a local hospital . the suspect was transported to the same hospital , but his injuries do not appear to be life threatening . charges are pending . the suspect was known to police , and had `` violent tendencies , '' jones said . police say weather and poor visibility also played a factor . there was dense fog in the area at the time of the incident . `` this is a call that i pray every night , every day , 10 times a day that i never get . and when you get it , you 're not ready for it , but you have to lead and you have to go on because you have to stand there and be that strength for your officers , but it 's one that you just ca n't even imagine , '' jones said in a news conference . `` it 's like losing a child because they 're all my children .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- back in 2010 britain 's politicians broke new ground . they were long used to haranguing each other in the uk 's rowdy house of commons -- but they 'd never had american style pre-election head-to-head debates . it is necessary and long-established political fare in the u.s. -- but over here in the uk , it was novel . it seemed to go well -- political points were scored , and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost . it was a drama of sorts , even though no knock-out punches were landed . prime minister david cameron and his conservative party won the election , but not by enough to go into government alone . for the past five years he 's been governing in coalition with the uk 's third party , the liberal democrats . and their leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , has mostly backed cameron in parliamentary debates against the opposition labour leader ed miliband . britain 's broadcasters , keen to channel lively politics onto prime time tv and boost ratings , have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout . what 's at stake is n't just the proposed debates ahead of may 's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into britain 's political architecture -- just like in the u.s. . but while cameron and miliband have hired former white house election advisers to edge them in to the lead , no one can agree on what form a debate should take , how many there should be , or even who should be invited . cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading uk parties -- giving equal airtime to the greens , the scottish nationalists and the upstart rightwing uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , among others . but miliband 's labour party is holding out for at least one head-to-head debate with cameron . no one seems to be budging but both of the uk 's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring . part of the problem is the british electorate , which has changed since 2010 , boosting the fortunes of some of the country 's former political outliers . the rightwing ukip , which has pledged to take the uk out of the european union , has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of cameron 's conservatives . in scotland , the september independence referendum -lrb- which narrowly failed -rrb- so reinvigorated the scottish national party that they could hit what is usually a key labour stronghold , undermining miliband 's bid for power . all of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous . for the big leaders who drive that conversation , it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals . it once looked like it would become as much of a british institution as rain , or fish and chips , but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all . on the upside , you can still tune in to house of commons tv most days of the week to get your fix of one lawmaker bellowing at another . but do it soon -- i hear that even those everyday raucous exchanges are being scrutinized for being a bit old-fashioned .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the maker of a controversial documentary about rape in india , leslee udwin , told cnn she is shocked by the indian authorities ' move to ban the film without even having seen it . the storm over `` india 's daughter '' blew up out of nowhere and is `` based on nothing , '' udwin said , in an interview for cnn 's `` the world right now with hala gorani . '' `` the tragedy here is it 's a missed opportunity for india to actually show by embracing the film ... to show the world that india is as concerned as the rest of the world is to put gender inequality on the agenda , '' she said . the bbc documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case in new delhi that sparked massive outrage and protests in india . an indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in india as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after comments by mukesh singh , the interviewed convict , were released in several media outlets . singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night , according to the documentary . the government has also asked google to remove excerpts of the film from video sharing site youtube . a google india spokeswoman , paroma roy chowdhury , said it would comply on the indian youtube site , `` as we are required to do so by the local law . '' a statement from the company read : `` while we believe that access to information is the foundation of a free society , and that services like youtube help people express themselves and share different points of view , we continue to remove content that is illegal or violates our community guidelines , once notified . '' udwin told cnn the restrictions appear to have been motivated by fear of `` public disorder . '' `` i presume they mean protests , '' she said . it was , in fact , the street protests , not the brutality of the crime , that first inspired udwin to make the film . but udwin , who spent 16 hours interviewing singh in prison over the course of three days , said the experience was chilling . `` he told me everything that happened that night , he told me everything about his attitudes towards society , women , hanging , all sorts ... he blamed her -- the society blames girls , the society itself , '' she said . `` look here 's the thing : all this hysteria ... people must understand these men are products of a learned attitude . they are programmed , they are brainwashed . the society itself tells girls to stay indoors after dark . '' udwin said she had done everything she could to elicit a human response from singh . she even had a list of the girl 's horrific rape-inflicted injuries , from which she died , read to him in hindi while she recorded his face . `` there were a few twitches but there was no remorse , there was no emotion , i do n't think he is capable of emotion , '' she said . singh , who was driving the bus on which the girl was attacked while traveling home from the movies with a male friend , is now on death row and has filed an appeal . but all singh says about how he , and the other men convicted over the rape , have been treated is to ask why such a fuss is being made about them when `` everybody 's doing it , '' udwin said . at the heart of the matter , she said , is the issue of gender inequality . from birth , boys in india and many other countries are accorded a higher status than girls , so it 's unsurprising that they go on to treat women as lesser beings . she compares gender inequality to a cancerous tumor that shows its spread through offenses against women . the dead girl 's father , who is also interviewed in the film , explained that in order to send his daughter to medical college , he sold a piece of ancestral land -- a big deal in india , udwin said . `` when he did that , his whole family was in revolt , '' said udwin . `` they said , ` why are you selling it to educate a girl ? ' `` now that is a comment that is in the documentary , uttered by the father . why is nobody saying to me , ` how dare you put that comment in the documentary ' ? '' in a statement , india 's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview , which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage . but udwin strongly rejected that claim . `` it would appear that the home minister has been utterly misinformed , '' she said . `` the permissions to interview this man were absolutely cast iron and all of the conditions imposed by them were obeyed by me and my team . '' udwin also speaks out for the `` massive swaths of indian people who are so forward looking , who are so embracing of change and are agents of that change . `` there are extraordinary women 's groups who have been working for generations towards this change . those protests were so admirable -- that 's what took me out there . '' and she stresses that the issues of gender inequality and sexual violence against women are not confined to india . the film ends with a series of statistics on sexual violence from other countries , she said , including the united states and united kingdom . this means that `` no viewer is is left off the hook at the end of the film in terms of thinking , ` this is something that happens to people over there . ' this happens to us , to every country , '' udwin said . cnn 's harmeet shah singh contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as many as 13 senior leaders of al-nusra front , including the terror group 's military commander , were killed in two syrian airstrikes thursday , a middle eastern security source who was briefed by syrian intelligence told cnn . abu hammam al shami was among those killed in the strikes against al-nusra , al qaeda 's largest affiliate in syria , the source said . syria 's state news agency sana also reported al shami 's death . the special operation that took place in hobait , in idlib province , was part of a wider effort by syrian forces to destroy areas believed to be gathering points for al-nusra militants around the province , according to sana . according to a 2014 al-nusra video , al shami joined the group after years of training in afghanistan and iraq . also killed in the northwestern province of idlib was a senior saudi operative in the group , the source said . there were initial indications that al-nusra leader abu mohammed al jolani was wounded in one of the strikes , the source said thursday . but on friday , the source told cnn the latest assessment of syrian intelligence was that al jolani was not injured . the strikes took place in the towns of salqin and hobait , both near the city of saraqeb in idlib . one strike targeted a meeting of senior al-nusra front leaders ; the other was on a home being used as a base , the source said . a spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition that is hitting isis targets in syria said its planes were n't involved . `` within the last 24 hours , we have not conducted any airstrikes within 200 miles of the province of idlib , '' the spokesman said earlier thursday . al shami was featured in a march 2014 video released by al-nusra front , in which he discussed his failed attempt to mediate between his militants and isis after rising tensions between the groups . the video included a biography by the group of al shami , which was translated by the long war journal . it said that in the late 1990s , al shami traveled to afghanistan , where he was trained in a camp run by abu musab al suri , a veteran syrian jihadi strategist . al shami then trained in al qaeda camps , where he met one of the 9/11 hijackers and personally swore allegiance to osama bin laden . by the time of the 9/11 attacks , al shami had started to train recruits in afghanistan and was named as the head of the syrian jihadist contingent within al qaeda . after the fall of the taliban , he fled afghanistan with senior egyptian al qaeda operative sayf al adel , the group said in the video . al shami began operating in iraq , where he began working with al qaeda in iraq founder abu musab al-zarqawi , conducting training for the group during the iraqi insurgency , the al-nusra video stated . in 2005 , al shami returned to afghanistan for a short period , at the request of al qaeda 's leadership . when he got to the afghanistan-pakistan region , one of bin laden 's top deputies , attiyah abd al rahman , tasked al shami with leading al qaeda efforts in syria , but he was arrested as he traveled through lebanon , according to the video , and was detained for five years . after being released , he found his way to syria , where he joined al-nusra , the group said . cnn 's jamie crawford contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year later , it still sounds impossible : a sophisticated $ 270 million airliner carrying 239 people disappears , leaving very few clues about where it went . but did the tragedy of malaysia airlines flight 370 really have to be such a mystery ? maybe not . lingering questions -- and the trauma experienced by friends and family of passengers and crew of the boeing 777-200er -- all might have been avoided if already proven technology had been put into place . believe it or not , in our modern world , airplane tracking technology has yet to enter the 21st century . take gps for example . why are n't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners ? how about communicating with satellites ? why do n't all airliners stream their so-called black box data to satellites in real time ? the technology is available . yes , it 's expensive , but so is searching hundreds of thousands of square miles of vast ocean . let 's break it down . flight 370 had eight ways to communicate with the ground while in flight : . • five very high frequency and high frequency radios that could transmit and receive voice and data transmissions . • two transponders that could send identification and altitude data to air traffic control radar screens . • one satellite transceiver that could transmit and receive text messages and phone calls . despite this technology , the world lost track of the flight with the airline industry codename mh370 . to understand why , you first have to know a little about the technology and the gaps in the system . throughout most of the world , air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s . radar is reliable , but it is limited . it comes with large gaps in coverage areas . aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens . radar covers only about 2 % or 3 % of the planet 's surface , experts say . the rest is a virtual aviation no man 's land . if an aircraft 's transponders are turned off , an aircraft can be seen only through so-called primary radar . in these cases , air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens . the blip is n't identified and the plane 's altitude is unknown . in a nutshell , here 's the electronic communication from flight 370 after it left kuala lumpur on march 8 , 2014 : . • nearly 30 minutes after takeoff , the plane sends a text via satellite that confirms it 's headed to beijing , as expected . • later , the plane sends a final radio call as it transitions between malaysia air traffic controllers to controllers in vietnam . but air traffic controllers in ho chi minh city never heard from the crew . • three minutes after the radio call , the plane 's two transponders mysteriously cease transmitting . • but primary radar operated by the military in malaysia and thailand is able to track the 777 for limited periods without its transponder being on . • later , an orbiting satellite checks in with the plane 's satellite transceiver , kind of like a cell tower pinging a mobile phone . the aircraft responds electronically -- `` shaking hands '' with the satellite . this provides evidence that flight mh370 ended somewhere in the southern indian ocean . all of these clues offer us only a few scraps of information that leave investigators with very little to go on . it leads them to an almost inescapable conclusion : whatever happened on mh370 was likely deliberate , experts say . we might know more if the plane 's transponders had remained active . in the wake of the tragedy , some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight . but many pilots oppose that idea as a safety issue . they want to be able to turn off any electrical system on board in case of a fire or other in-flight emergency . we might know more about what happened to mh370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners , instead of radar . in the united states it 's called the next generation air transportation system , or nextgen . an aircraft outfitted with this system determines its location using gps and transmits that data back to controllers by radio -- which has a greater range than radar . the technology is called automatic dependent surveillance broadcast , or ads-b . it is the keystone component of nextgen . but still , when an aircraft flies over the ocean , it will be out of range . so the industry is testing a space-based system -- where planes would determine their position via gps satellites and report those coordinates via communication satellite network wherever they are in the world . there are numerous technical details that need to be worked out , but moving from spinning radar domes to orbiting satellites could eventually make blind spots in airliner tracking a thing of the past . another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called afirs , the automated flight information reporting system , developed by a canadian company called flyht . afirs monitors what the flight data recorder , one of the so-called `` black boxes , '' is seeing . it starts transmitting key information automatically when it senses trouble or at the command of the flight crew or dispatchers on the ground . canada 's first air is among the first airlines to equip its fleet with afirs , which costs $ 100,000 per plane . if all airliners were equipped this way , we could know a flight was in trouble even if the crew could not communicate by other means . it could make searching for the black boxes a thing of the past . in the months since mh370 was lost , international aviation authorities have moved toward tracking airliners more closely . the international air transport association has announced new tracking mandates for member airlines , but there are no plans to require streaming data . and this week , australia 's air traffic control manager , airservices australia , announced a test partnership with malaysia and indonesia to track long-haul flights over remote ocean routes . they 'll use satellite-based positioning technology to track flights at least every 15 minutes -- improving on the previous tracking rate of every 30 to 45 minutes , airservices australia said in a statement . `` the system can be increased to real time monitoring should an abnormal situation arise . '' would any of these improvements in airline communication technology have helped the world learn what happened to flight 370 ? possibly . unfortunately , we may never know for sure . although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication , the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people .
hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- a canadian pastor , who went to north korea on a humanitarian trip in late january , is being held in the reclusive communist state , his family said early thursday . the family of rev. hyeon soo lim said they received notice from canadian officials that pyongyang has confirmed that the pastor is being held . `` the lim family and the church community is asking fellow canadians and the international community to continue praying for his release and safe return home , '' a family spokeswoman said in a short emailed statement . lim , 60 , went to north korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before , said lisa pak , a spokeswoman for his church , based in mississauga , ontario . on january 30 , lim traveled to north korea from china with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day . lim was scheduled to return february 4 from what was described as a `` routine '' trip to rajin , in northeastern north korea , where his church supports a nursery , orphanage and nursing home , according to the light korean presbyterian church . in 1986 , lim immigrated to canada from south korea with his wife and son . he speaks fluent korean and leads a 3,000-member church . pak , the church 's spokeswoman , said she does n't believe lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing , which is prohibited in north korea . `` he knows the language , he knows the nature of the government , so we do n't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained , '' she said . `` we do n't believe that 's the way he would have behaved . he 's very wise about that . '' previously , north korea has detained westerners on religious grounds . cases include american kenneth bae , who was detained for two years after north korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities . bae was released in november . another american , jeffrey fowle , was arrested after leaving a bible at a club in north korea and released after five months in detention . aijalon mahli gomes , a u.s. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a christian activist , was released from north korea in 2010 after a visit to pyongyang by former u.s. president jimmy carter . cnn 's kj kwon contributed to this report from seoul , south korea , and tina burnside from atlanta .
kano , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- suspected boko haram gunmen shot dead and slit the throats of 68 people -- including children -- in an attack on a village in nigeria 's borno state , according to survivors and vigilante sources . the attackers then burned down the entire village of njaba , the sources said . dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn tuesday , singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents , witnesses said . njaba village lies about 65 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- south of maiduguri , the capital of borno state . karimu lawani , who escaped to maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor , said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. `` they shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old , '' lawani said . he and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later . his account was supported by faltama bisika , 62 , who lost four grandchildren in the attack . `` they hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee . they particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people , '' bisika said . news of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous boko haram attacks . `` i only got information of the attack on my village last night , '' said a civilian vigilante from njaba who asked not to be named . the vigilante said his father was among those killed . the vigilante said he left njaba for maiduguri in june to join others fighting against the islamist radical group . he said he believes the attackers came from gwoza -- a town on nigeria 's mountainous border with cameroon that boko haram seized last june -- because njaba `` lies on the route to gwoza from maiduguri .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a new justice department report on ferguson 's police and courts could not be more clear : change is needed . the 102-page report details widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks at the hands of officials -- painting probably the clearest picture yet of what the rule of law looks and feels like in the missouri city . it includes 26 recommendations . the report is scathing in its critique , and clear about what needs to happen next , but it does n't address the question : who , if anyone , is responsible for what took place ? are individual officers to blame ? is the police chief ? what about city officials who repeatedly pushed police to increase revenue through ticketing , resulting in disproportionate targeting of african-americans ? writing for cnn , criminal defense attorney mark o'mara argues in favor of gutting the entire police department , and starting from scratch . so far , one person has been fired ; two more are on administrative leave . are more heads likely to roll ? `` when the attorney general said that the department of justice has made certain recommendations , those are n't necessarily just recommendations . the ferguson police department and municipal courts will have to reform . this is a must-do situation . we 're talking about wholesale reform , '' said cnn legal analyst sunny hostin . `` and i would be very surprised that any of the leadership remains . '' mayor james knowles said the two employees on leave are awaiting the results of an internal investigation . `` department of justice officials informed the city of ferguson that a review of city emails uncovered explicit racial bias by three individuals who are employed by the city of ferguson police department . let me be clear : this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the ferguson police department or in any department in the city of ferguson , '' he told reporters wednesday . `` the three individuals were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation . one has since been terminated . '' a source said the two employees `` will not survive the investigation . '' cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin criticized the mayor 's response , seemingly suggesting that more needed to be done in the wake of the justice department report . `` you read this report , and , one officer loses his job ? you know , you translate the bureaucratic gobbledygook of the mayor , that 's all that happened there , '' he said . surprisingly to some , controversial police chief tom jackson remains at the helm . so does knowles . although the report is limited to correcting action going forward , people affected by past abuses do have the option of filing civil lawsuits against specific individuals . such cases are not easy to bring , according to peter joy , a law professor at washington university in st. louis . `` in a court of law , the findings of this report would n't even be admissible , '' he said . `` basically , you 'd have to prove each allegation . '' joy gave an example of person who paid a $ 100 fine that was unjustly levied . finding lawyers who would take an individual case like that would be tough , he said , because there is no guarantee they could recover on behalf of their client , and the amount of damages could very widely . practically , that person may be out of luck . but if the justice department gets its way , illegal or improper behavior on the part of police and courts in ferguson could soon be a thing of the past . `` it is time for ferguson 's leaders to take immediate , wholesale and structural corrective action , '' said attorney general eric holder . `` the united states department of justice reserves all of its rights and abilities to force compliance and to implement basic change . nothing is off the table .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- one is a 21-year-old california man accused of trying to travel to syria to join isis . another , a 17-year-old virginia student charged with helping recruit for the radical islamist group . charges against both were released wednesday , and they are just the latest in a growing number of similar cases from the united states . more than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for isis , the terror group that controls portions of iraq and syria , experts have told congress . national intelligence director james clapper said 180 americans have tried to go to fight in syria . it 's unclear how many of those were attempting to join isis . here are some of their stories : . arrested at george h.w. bush houston intercontinental airport before a flight to europe , wolfe was charged in june `` with attempting to provide material support to terrorists , '' authorities said . he `` planned to travel to the middle east to provide his services to radical groups engaged in armed conflict in syria , '' according to a complaint . on february 2 , 2014 , an undercover agent met with wolfe and his wife and they watched a youtube video about foreign fighters in syria , officials said . wolfe allegedly discussed the activities of isis , they said . the 18-year-old from inver grove heights , minnesota , pleaded guilty at a minneapolis federal court to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to isis . yusuf was stopped by the fbi from boarding a flight to turkey from minneapolis/saint paul airport in may . yusuf and another man , abdi nur , were charged in late november with conspiring to aid isis . conley 's plan to join isis and serve as a nurse at a jihadist camp ended in september with a guilty plea on a terror charge in a colorado federal court . arrested in april , the 19-year-old was at denver international airport about to embark on a journey to germany and eventually to an isis camp near the turkish border . she told investigators she was going to turkey to await word from her suitor , an isis member she met on the internet , whom she planned to marry . the cincinnati 20-year-old was on the fbi 's radar for months as he posted about violent jihad on social media . the feds said they arrested him before he could hatch his alleged plot . reminiscent of the attack on the charlie hebdo offices in paris , he planned to set off pipe bombs at the u.s. capitol , and when employees and lawmakers fled the building , he and an accomplice would shoot them , according to a criminal complaint . cornell allegedly told an informant he had been in contact with people overseas , and that he had aligned himself with isis . the attack , according to the complaint , would be a way of supporting the extremist group . the stoughton , massachusetts , man was first placed on the fbi terror list for 2009 crimes but since has been suspected of joining isis , officials said . he 's fluent in both english and arabic , and if his college degree in computers is any indication , he has a way with technology . then there 's his interest in radical islam . put it all together , and authorities said former boston resident and u.s. citizen ahmad abousamra could be a good fit inside the isis social media machine that 's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda across social media . the son of a palestinian father and italian-american mother , the 22-year-old from vero beach , florida , is believed to be the first american suicide bomber to die in syria . the former high school football

-lrb- cnn -rrb- nascar driver kurt busch will not be charged with domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend , the delaware department of justice announced thursday , citing a lack of evidence . busch was accused by patricia driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against the wall in his motor home at dover international speedway in september . `` after a thorough consideration of all of the available information about the case , it is determined that the admissible evidence and available witnesses would likely be insufficient to meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that mr. busch committed a crime during the september 26th incident , '' delaware department of justice public information officer carl kanefsky said in a statement . `` likelihood of meeting that high burden of proof is the standard for prosecutors in bringing a case . for this reason , the department of justice will not pursue criminal charges in this case . '' in a statement thursday , busch said he is grateful that the prosecutors decided not to file charges . `` i wish to thank my family , friends , fans , and race team who stood by me throughout this nightmare with their unwavering support , '' busch said . `` thanks also goes to my legal team for making sure that the truth got out and was fully provided to the prosecutors . as i have said from the beginning , i did not commit domestic abuse . i look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life . '' while busch will not be charged , he must stay away from driscoll for one year , a kent county , delaware , family court commissioner ruled in february . driscoll had requested a no-contact order against busch . stemming from the family court ruling , nascar suspended busch indefinitely shortly before the daytona 500 . that decision was upheld after appeal . cnn has reached out to nascar for an update on busch 's status but did not immediately hear back . `` patricia and i are very disappointed that kurt will not be prosecuted for the abusive acts he committed in september , '' driscoll 's attorney , carolyn mcneice , said thursday . `` the -lrb- attorney general 's -rrb- decision , however , only makes the order that we received for protection from abuse that much more important . `` as you can see , in some cases , this is the only protection the victim will get . this civil no contact order is a critical tool for protecting victims . '' busch 's attorney , rusty hardin , previously has said that he would appeal the family court ruling and would continue to work to clear busch 's name . at the no-contact hearing , busch testified that he believes driscoll is a trained assassin for the u.s. government and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood . driscoll is a defense contractor and is authorized to carry weapons . mcneice has said that her client denies busch 's allegations .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- blame joshuah purdy brown . or , if you prefer , p.t. barnum . it 's thanks to those 19th-century promoters that the elephant rose to become the circus 's king of beasts -- the living symbol of `` the greatest show on earth . '' `` this is something that has been a big deal historically , '' says circus historian janet davis , an american studies professor at the university of texas . traditionally , she observes , elephants are the stars of the parade when circuses come to town . there was even a 19th-century phrase , `` to see the elephant , '' a euphemism used by soldiers for seeing battle , recognizing the wonder and rarity of these giant animals . on thursday , ringling brothers , part of the feld entertainment firm , announced that it would be ending use of elephants by 2018 . it 's a startling change for the show , which has made the giant pachyderms a centerpiece of its presentation for decades and weathered criticism for their treatment from animal rights groups . cnnmoney : the greatest show on earth will soon be without elephants . brown was perhaps the first to make elephants a part of the circus atmosphere . the modern circus only dates back to around 1770 , the invention of an englishman named philip astley , who added jugglers , acrobats and clowns to his equestrian show . -lrb- the term `` circus '' comes from the ancient romans , although the roman version was closer to a sporting event featuring soldiers , and it could be quite bloody . -rrb- . astley 's circus was such a huge success that he created one in paris , and his students and acolytes -- knowing a good idea when they saw one -- brought the circus to other cities . to this day , the ringmaster wears elegant riding clothes because of the circus ' equestrian roots . brown , a shrewd marketer who was also responsible for making the circus a tented traveling show , added a `` menagerie '' to the event to help combat the form 's sometimes seedy reputation . `` circuses in this era were really for adults , and not marketed for children at all , '' says davis . brown 's show , by adding a menagerie tent to the circus tent , could market their shows as educationally uplifting by `` showing people the wonders of the animal world , '' she adds . by the 1850s , elephants were regular circus attractions . then came barnum . in the early 1870s , the clever entrepreneur , who had made his fortune with such acts as the `` feejee mermaid , '' singer jenny lind and a new york-based museum of curiosities , created p.t. barnum 's museum , menagerie and circus . `` they had exotic animals from the four corners of the earth , and you had to go through the menagerie first and then you went to your seat in the big top , '' deborah walk , curator of collections for the ringling museums , told pbs for a 2010 documentary called `` circus . '' `` there was no way to miss the menagerie -- it was all part of the educational outreach to get people to go to the show . '' barnum and his partner made the circus an efficient business , running it on the railroad to far-flung destinations and transporting their animals long distances . `` elephants become this incredibly important signature part of the circus , '' says davis . the beasts were huge attractions . when barnum announced he was going to bring a white elephant back from asia , a competitor whitewashed his own elephant and engaged in a media war . -lrb- the clash popularized the term `` white elephant . '' -rrb- another barnum purchase , the african elephant jumbo , was the centerpiece of his circus , and when jumbo died in 1885 , the victim of a train accident , the news made worldwide headlines . the attitudes towards elephants , and circus animals in general , started changing in the early 20th century , says davis . for one thing , until world war i , the circus was the king of the entertainment circuit : `` there were no movies , radio or television to compete with the wonders of the circus ring and little traffic congestion or parking problems to impede those who sought to attend , '' wrote bob brooke in history magazine . and in recent decades animal-rights activists have increasingly protested against the use of performing mammals such as elephants and killer whales , demanding better treatment for them . ringling brothers and other circus companies have dealt with numerous challenges over the last half-century , including ever-splintering attention for entertainment dollars and the rise of acrobat-based shows such as cirque du soleil , which is now a global empire . but `` the greatest show on earth '' is still hugely popular , and davis believes the loss of elephants wo n't affect the circus ' bottom line . still , she says , there is something special about the majestic animals . at a show she attended in 2013 , the elephants had their own space , and a bunch of children were standing nearby , watching them in awe . `` it was very moving , '' she says . `` this physical proximity to these animals is powerful . '' when it comes to circus animal acts , are more changes to come ? are lions and tigers next ? davis wonders . `` in a way , the elephant is kind of the bellwether animal . i would imagine this is a kind of catalyst , '' she says . `` i would imagine that we have not heard the last of the kind of changes that are afoot in terms of animals and circuses . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the family of michael brown , the teen killed last year by ferguson police officer darren wilson , will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case `` very shortly , '' attorney anthony gray said thursday . neither he nor attorney daryl parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed , but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury 's and the justice department 's decisions not to charge wilson in the shooting . `` they have accepted -lrb- wilson 's -rrb- self-defense , '' parks told reporters . `` we do not accept his self-defense . '' the slain teen 's parents , michael brown sr. and lesley mcspadden , were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys , parks said . `` the last 24 hours have been tough for them , '' he said . word of the lawsuit comes a day after the justice department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge wilson in brown 's death but found in a separate investigation that the ferguson police department showed a pattern of racial bias . brown sr. and mcspadden released a statement wednesday saying they were disappointed that wilson would not face charges , but , they added , the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining . `` we are encouraged that the doj will hold the ferguson police department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color , '' the statement said . `` it is our hope that through this action , true change will come not only in ferguson , but around the country . if that change happens , our son 's death will not have been in vain . '' in november , a grand jury cleared wilson and , in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings , the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered . gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on `` pretty much the same evidence , '' but it will be cast differently . the jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence , rather than beyond a reasonable doubt , parks said . summing up the crux of the brown family 's case , parks said , `` there were other alternatives available to -lrb- wilson -rrb- . he did not have to kill michael brown .

seoul , south korea -lrb- cnn -rrb- a man opposed to joint south korean-u.s. military drills attacked the american ambassador in seoul , slashing his face and arm as he was about to give a speech thursday morning , authorities said . north korea quickly called the stabbing a `` knife attack of justice '' and said it reflected `` anti-u.s. sentiment '' in south korea . authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for the knifing suspect , kim ki-jong , an official at seoul central district court said friday . he was detained immediately after the attack , with authorities having time to formally arrest him or let him go . kim , 55 , who has a history of unpredictable behavior , could eventually be charged with attempted murder and other charges . a police official , yoon myeong-seong , also told reporters that kim had previously visited north korea seven times between 1999 and 2007 , and that authorities were `` intensively investigating '' a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and this attack . the u.s. ambassador to south korea , mark lippert , was in stable condition after undergoing more than two hours of surgery , in which he got 80 stitches to his face . he will probably remain hospitalized for three to four days , said dr. jung nam-shik at yonsei severance hospital . in 2010 , kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a japanese ambassador to south korea , according to the yonhap news agency . the motive for his attack thursday ? he wanted an end to the south korean-u.s. military drills to improve north-south relations , police said . the drills are held annually despite predictably harsh criticism from north korea . the north korean government believes the attack is `` just punishment for u.s. warmongers , '' according to its official news agency , kcna . south korean president park geun-hye , on the other hand , condemned it . `` this incident is not only a physical attack on the u.s. ambassador , '' she said , `` but an attack on the south korea-u.s. alliance and it can never be tolerated . '' u.s. diplomats have been attacked , killed in past . lippert was attacked while attending an event organized by the korean council for reconciliation and cooperation , which advocates peaceful reunification between the two koreas . the u.s. embassy did not request special security for the event , seoul police said . three police officers were on duty at the building 's entrance , and 25 others were on standby . kim sat down at a different table than lippert , then got up and ran to the ambassador 's right side yelling something that sounded like anti-american sentiments . `` when the man jumped on the ambassador , i stood up and jumped on the man , and they both fell on the ground , '' a witness , jang yoon seok , told cnn affiliate ytn . `` luckily i got on top of the man 's back and could press him to the floor . then others came to hold him on the floor . '' jang said he later saw the knife on the table . it had a wooden handle and did not look particularly sophisticated , he said . seoul police said a knife , about 10 inches long , was used in the assault and the suspect brought it from home . videos showed the suspect pinned on the floor , rolled into a blanket and carried out of the building . he was heard shouting , `` the south korea-u.s. military drills must stop . '' the drills began earlier this week . explaining the joint south korea-u.s. military exercises . after the attack , lippert -- clutching his right cheek and holding a bloodied arm -- was photographed hurrying out of the sejong cultural institute in central seoul . the cut to his face runs from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw and is about 4 inches long and about an inch deep , dr. jung said . fortunately , there was no damage to his facial nerve . lippert also suffered five gashes in his left arm and hand , but he is not likely to have permanent damage to his arm function . `` the ambassador was very calm . people around him were taken aback , but he was very calm , '' said dr. john linton . `` he was speaking with his doctor on what to do . it was surprising . '' as the ambassador left and headed to the hospital , investigators arrived , hoping to figure out exactly what happened . while there are videos showing what happened at the event , none of them will be from closed-circuit surveillance cameras , said yoon , the seoul police chief . the only such camera outside the building did help authorities determine exactly when lippert and kim came in . was the attack part of a larger plot ? did kim have any help , implicit or explicit ? not if you ask him , according to the seoul police chief . `` kim insists that this was done by himself , '' yoon said . `` but police are still investigating if he acted alone and what his motive was . '' park , south korea 's president , told lippert by phone that she was surprised and deeply troubled to hear about the attack -- an incident similar to one targeting her several years ago -- the asian nation 's foreign ministry said on its website . the south korean leader vowed that authorities will `` take necessary measures ... with utmost seriousness and urgency '' to get to the bottom of the latest attack . she also promised to keep close ties with the united states `` so that the incident would not have any negative implications on the -lrb- south korean -rrb- - u.s. alliance , '' according to the ministry . for park 's american counterpart , president barack obama , the attack is personal as well as political . that 's because lippert is a longtime friend and confidant , having been part of obama 's inner circle for years . obama called lippert `` to tell him that he and his wife robyn are in his thoughts and prayers , and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery , '' national security council spokeswoman bernadette meehan said . lippert has been close to obama ever since he arrived in the senate in 2005 . lippert worked with obama on the senate foreign relations committee and traveled the world with the then-senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign . when obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race , lippert was by his side again , and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the obama campaign . obama nominated lippert to serve as ambassador to south korea last year . thursday afternoon , lippert tweeted that he was recuperating . `` doing well & in great spirits ! robyn , sejun , grigsby & i - deeply moved by the support ! '' he tweeted , referring to his wife , his son and his dog . `` will be back asap to advance us-rok alliance ! '' he then added in korean , `` let 's work together !

-lrb- cnn -rrb- archaeologists searching for a lost city in the jungles of honduras have discovered the urban remains of what they believe is a vanished ancient civilization , national geographic reports . a writer and photographer for the magazine accompanied a team of scientists to honduras ' mosquitia region on the trail of a legendary `` white city '' or `` city of the monkey god . '' the expedition was launched after aerial light detection scanning -- known as lidar -- uncovered what appeared to be man-made structures below the rainforest , national geographic said . seeking to confirm the discovery , a team of u.s. and honduran archaeologists , a lidar engineer , an ethnobotanist , anthropologists and documentary filmmakers entered the remote region . they were protected by honduran special forces , the magazine said . writer douglas preston said the team emerged february 25 , after documenting the ruins of a `` vanished culture . '' `` in contrast to the nearby maya , this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown . archaeologists do n't even have a name for it , '' douglas wrote . archaeologists no longer believed in the existence of a single `` white city , '' he said , instead believing there had been an entire civilization with many cities . the expedition found earth works , including an earthen pyramid as well as a collection of stone sculptures , thought to potentially have been burial offerings . archaeologist oscar neil cruz from the honduran institute of anthropology and history -lrb- ihah -rrb- estimated they dated from a.d. 1000 to 1400 , douglas wrote . the researchers were greeted by wildlife which appeared never before to have seen humans , wandering unafraid through their camp . `` this is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in central america . the importance of this place ca n't be overestimated , '' ethnobotanist mark plotkin told national geographic . the team left their finds unexcavated and are keeping the exact location of the site secret in an attempt to prevent looting . but in his article , douglas warned that that the area was nonetheless under threat , with illegal logging for cattle farming within a dozen miles . ihah director virgilio paredes trapero told national geographic that the forest and valley could disappear within eight years unless action was taken . `` the honduran government is committed to protecting this area , but does n't have the money . we urgently need international support .

'' tazi 's studios also offer dozens of set options -- from styrofoam egyptian temples to plaster-cast tibetan palaces . national geographic used one of his sets in the mini-series `` killing jesus '' -- the seven-week production was filmed by a crew of 250 people and included 4,500 extras . bargain hunting . atlas studios opened in 1983 to host the michael douglas classic `` the jewel of the nile . '' since then , around 200 tv shows and films have been shot there , including `` babel , '' starring brad pitt and cate blanchett . `` morocco is one of the countries that goes out of its way to welcome film makers , '' says tony reeves , writer of the worldwide guide to movie locations . `` technical crews in morocco are well sought after -- builders , painters , extras , electrical resources . '' but in recent years productions have been hit by the global financial crisis and the uncertainty following the arab spring which ripped through north africa . between 2008 and 2013 , tazi 's revenue dropped by 50 % . such a slowdown hit ouarzazate ` seconomy , where many of the 100,000 citizens rely on the cinema industry from employment . `` the city is poor . there -lsb- are -rsb- few job opportunities , '' says resident abdelaziz bouydnayen , who once played osama bin laden in a national geographic documentary . `` we are all just waiting ... there are millions of dollars that come into this city , but the city is still poor . '' in the past decade , both of the town 's theaters have closed leaving residents without a place to watch the films shot in their back yard . changing times . yet , a series of recent developments have started to show the start of a revival . last year , 22 films used tazi 's studios -- up from 12 in 2013 . foreign film projects spent $ 120 million in 2014 , according to the country 's film commission -- up from $ 23 million the previous year . and part of the reason filmmakers keep coming to morocco are the tax-incentives -- foreign crews are exempt from paying value added tax . but the other reason is the experience of moroccan talent . `` making stories of biblical proportions requires that there be casts of hundreds '' says roma downey , who is producing the upcoming tv series `` a.d. '' in morocco . `` to wrangle that many people and have them be so focused and understand what they 're doing is a big part of what they 're doing . it save time , saves money . '' tazi is so confident that the current boom will continue that he plans to build a brand new roman-themed set this year . he 's hoping to keep the cameras rolling and action going in morocco 's hollywood . more from marketplace africa . read this : teenager brings poop power to kenyan school . read this : bitcoins hit africa 's money transfer traditions .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- with the discovery of a gray , fossilized jawbone in a remote corner of ethiopia , a student at arizona state university may have changed our understanding of our earliest ancestors . the partial lower jaw is the oldest known fossil evidence of the genus homo , to which modern day humans belong , according to a study published wednesday in the journal science . the jawbone has been dated to 2.8 million years ago -- which predates the previously known fossils of the homo lineage by approximately 400,000 years , according to arizona state university . chalachew seyoum , a graduate student from ethiopia , came across the fossil -- the left side of a lower jaw with five teeth -- while on a field expedition in the afar region of eastern ethiopia in 2013 . `` honestly , it was an exciting moment , '' seyoum said , according to a news release from the university . `` i had good experience in field surveying and knew where potential sediments are . i climbed up a little plateau and found this specimen right on the edge of the hill . '' the age of the fossil means it could help fill in an important gap in our knowledge . fossil found by fisherman may reveal new type of ancient human . it also means the homo genus could have evolved nearly half a million years earlier than previously thought . researchers have previously found fossil remains dating back 3 million years or more , such as the skeleton of `` lucy , '' the famous 3.2 million-year-old remains of the species australopithecus afarensis . those remains were found in 1974 not far from the site of the latest discovery . scientists have also found fossils that are 2.3 million years old and younger , which are in the genus homo and are closer to modern day humans . but until now there has been little fossil evidence from the 700,000 years in between -- a crucial period in the evolution from hominids like lucy to the homo genus . `` the importance of the specimen is that it adds a data point to a period of time in our ancestry in which we have very little information , '' said william h. kimbel , director of asu 's institute of human origins , in the university 's news release . `` this is a little piece of the puzzle that opens the door to new types of questions and field investigations that we can go after to try to find additional evidence to fill in this poorly known time period . '' the jawbone , found in the ledi-geraru area of the afar region , combines features seen in australopithecus afarensis with those seen in later specimens of the homo genus , according to the study . professor kaye reed , of arizona state university , said the discovery was the result of years of searching in the area . surveying began in 2002 , she said , but researchers only began to pick up fossils in the area where the jawbone was found in 2012 , having realized the sediments there were old enough to yield australopithecus afarensis specimens . `` instead , we were rewarded with a much more exciting discovery , '' she said . already the team has been able to establish that this early human ancestor walked on two legs and lived in a dry , arid climate , reed said . researchers are still working to determine what it ate and whether it used stone tools . `` it 's an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution , '' said kimbel . paleolithic skull may shed light on humans ' path from africa .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- isis has again destroyed cultural treasures , this time bulldozing the site of the ancient assyrian city of nimrud in northern iraq , the nation 's ministry of tourism and antiquities said . `` isis continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity , '' the ministry said in a statement . `` they violated the ancient city of nimrud and bulldozed its ancient ruins . '' the extent of the damage was n't immediately clear , according to iraqi state broadcaster iraqiya tv . `` our ministry condemns these criminal acts , '' the statement said . `` letting these lost gangs go without punishment will encourage them to destroy humanity 's civilization , the mesopotamian civilization , inflicting irreversible priceless damages and losses . '' photos : precious monuments lost in conflicts . nimrud was a city in the assyrian kingdom , which flourished between 900 b.c. and 612 b.c. . the archaeological site is south of mosul in northern iraq . the razing of nimrud comes a week after a video showed isis militants using sledgehammers to obliterate stone sculptures and other centuries-old artifacts in the mosul museum . that museum held 173 original pieces of antiquity and was being readied for reopening when isis invaded mosul in june , according to qais hussain rashid , the antiquities ministry 's director general of iraqi museums , who spoke to iraqiya tv last week . nimrud and nearby nineveh are the sites where two assyrian kings , sennacherib -lrb- 704-681 b.c. -rrb- and ashurnasirpal ii -lrb- 883-859 b.c. -rrb- , recorded successful military campaigns on the walls of their palaces , according to the world monuments fund , a group dedicated to saving the world 's most treasured places . `` depicted in the reliefs are marauding troops in foreign lands , rendered in a style marked by lively action and attention paid to topographic and ethnographic detail , '' the fund 's website says . `` the palaces of sennacherib at nineveh and ashurnasirpal ii at nimrud are vestiges of the political , cultural and artistic height of the assyrian empire . the remains of these palaces , the only assyrian palaces left preserved and decorated with reliefs , are now protected against vandals and function as site museums where visitors can appreciate ancient wall reliefs in their original setting , '' the fund said in a website posting before this week 's isis assault on nimrud . king ashurnasirpal ii made nimrud the royal seat and the military capital of assyria , encyclopedia britannica 's website says . buildings at nimrud `` have yielded thousands of carved ivories , mostly made in the 9th and 8th centuries b.c. , now one of the richest collections of ivory in the world , '' the encyclopedia says . isis has destroyed other ancient and deeply meaningful sites in iraq . officials have said isis has blown up shrines such as the tomb of jonah . opinion : destruction of antiquities proves folly , hypocrisy of isis .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- australia lodged a formal complaint friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution . during the transfer , a senior indonesian police officer was pictured in photos with the australian pair on a flight . myuran sukumaran and andrew chan were being taken from kerobokan prison in bali to nusakambangan island in central java , where they will be held in a maximum security facility before facing a 12-man firing squad . the date of the execution is not yet known , although the convicted will be informed at least 72 hours before they are put to death . australia 's department of foreign affairs said it had lodged a formal complaint with the indonesian embassy in canberra over the treatment of the prisoners during the transfer , which took place before dawn on wednesday . australian foreign minister julie bishop told australian media that an undue show of force , including armored vehicles and dozens of officers in helmets and balaclavas , was also used during the transfer . `` i just can not comprehend it . they are two men who are described by their own prison governors as model citizens , two gentlemen who pose no risk to anyone , '' she told the abc 's am program . `` i can not comprehend the manner or the method of their transfer to the so-called execution island . '' a spokesman for indonesia 's ministry of foreign affairs said the photos were taken without the consent of the officer involved , commissioner djoko hari utomo . `` the officer was inquiring about the physical condition of mr chan , '' arrmanatha nasir told cnn in regard to one of the images . `` it is regretful that this photo is being used by the media to portray something more than what it really is . '' australia 's complaint comes after indonesia dismissed a last-minute proposal to save the pair 's lives through a prisoner swap . nasir told cnn that there are no indonesian laws that would allow or provide for an exchange . `` indonesia does not have legislation or laws or any other legal instruments that will enable the issue of a prisoner exchange to be conducted , '' he said , adding that the australian government had been informed of this stance . sukumaran and chan , members of the so-called `` bali nine '' smuggling ring , have been held by indonesian authorities for nearly a decade . they are expected to be held in a maximum security facility on nusakambangan where they will be isolated before being put to death . they are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution . australian government and opposition parliamentarians attended a candlelight vigil at dawn thursday , as a spectacular sunrise lit politicians from across australia 's political spectrum , united in opposition to the impending executions . `` we appeal to the indonesian president to grant a stay of clemency , '' bishop told the gathering . she reminded the indonesian government that legal avenues remained open , before appealing for mercy on behalf of the convicted men 's families . `` i 've spoken to the families . they are going through an unimaginably difficult time and i ask that you think of the families who are praying that their son , brother , grandson can have their life spared . we appeal again to president widodo , the leader of a strong and proud country , to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young australians . '' australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair . they have been jailed since april 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from bali to australia . opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war . prime minister tony abbott said people should not let anger affect australians ' relationship with indonesia . `` we abhor drug crime , but we abhor the death penalty . we think that these two australians deserve to be punished , but they certainly do n't deserve to be executed , '' he said . the bali nine were arrested after indonesian police received a tip from australian federal police . chan , 31 , was called the ringleader of the plot , and sukumaran was described as chan 's collaborator in the scheme . seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences . police caught four people at the denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies . another four -- including sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of kuta . chan was detained after a boarding a plane to sydney -- he was n't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot . the indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two australians against president joko widodo . the attorneys wanted a review of the president 's decision to deny them clemency . todung mulya lubis , who represents the pair , said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons . `` there should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on , '' lubis said . sukumaran and chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars , according to fellow inmates and the jail 's chief warden . sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates . chan has found spirituality , which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems . their rehabilitation is genuine , bishop has previously said . `` andrew and myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve , '' she told the australian parliament in february . indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers , and widodo has made it clear he does n't intend to introduce a policy of leniency . in december , six prisoners were killed by firing squad , including five foreigners from brazil , the netherlands , malawi , nigeria and vietnam . brazilian president dilma rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had `` severely affected '' relations with indonesia . cnn 's steve almasy , camille feanny and jennifer deaton contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the photographs released by isis in its stronghold of raqqa are dated march 2015 . the first ones show a large crowd , mostly men , but also among them a handful of women and children , all looking up . three men on top of a building , faces covered in black balaclavas , stand on either side of their victim , while a fourth seems to be taking a photo or video . their victim is thrown off the building . in the last photograph , he is seen face down , surrounded by a small crowd of men , most carrying weapons , some with rocks in their hands . the caption reads `` stoned to death . '' the victim brutally killed because he was accused of being gay . there are at least half a dozen documented cases of men being similarly killed by isis . what 's even more sickening for nour , a gay syrian man , is the onlookers ' reaction . `` it 's too much to watch , and people are just standing there in these images and watching , and they are not doing anything , and their facial expressions are really scary because they are not even scared of what is going on , '' says nour , who 's also an lgbt rights activist . `` they might be a little bit excited or maybe happy to get rid of homosexuals in the city . '' though in istanbul , fear of persecution continues to haunt nour , who asked us to conceal his identity as he waits and hopes for asylum in america and continues to campaign for rights for people who are lgbt -- lesbian , gay , bisexual and trans . as a teenager , over a decade ago , nour suffered because of his sexuality . `` the worst bullying was at school , '' he remembers . `` i was approached in the street a number of times , verbally abused and sometimes physically abused . '' there was no one to protect him . his family rejected his sexual orientation , his country criminalized it . article 520 of the syrian penal code of 1949 states : `` any unnatural sexual intercourse shall be punished with a term of imprisonment of up to three years . '' nour left syria in 2012 , before isis took over huge swaths of the country , after seeing a video of two men being beheaded . according to the voice on the clip , they are accused of being spies . then toward the end , the voice speaks about `` shaking the throne of god . '' `` whenever we hear this in video or audio , we know that this is exactly meant for gay people , '' he says . `` it was the moment of clarity , the moment of understanding ; this place is not safe anymore . '' the pictures released by isis and other videos refer to gay men as the tribe of lot , who , according to readings of the quran and the hadith , or prophetic traditions , sinned by refusing prophet lot 's call to cease their homosexual activity and led to the destruction of sodom . one hadith states , `` when a man mounts another man , the throne of god shakes . '' since the revolution turned war in syria , the situation for the nation 's lgbt community has become even more dire . `` lgbt people in syria need help , and they need to be supported . we tried to reach out to some groups , international entities , and they said that lgbt people in syria are not our priority , and that would mean that our lives are not worthy for them to rescue , '' nour says . this week , the international gay and lesbian human rights commission , a nongovernmental organization based in new york , started `` do n't turn away , '' an awareness-raising campaign calling for action to protect lgbt syrians and iraqis from isis ' merciless brutality . on its website , the group states , `` what is clear is the islamic state 's intent -- to spread terror among an already persecuted population in the region and to warn against any kind of ` moral ' transgression . '' the commission is calling on governments and the united nations high commissioner for refugees to expedite resettlement and refugee applications for lgbts . sami and his partner are among those waiting . dressed in matching outfits , they already consider themselves married , laughing about how they first met online . they too , like nour , do n't want their identities revealed . when sami 's family found out about his relationship , he says , his brother tried to beat him up . he started to receive threatening phone calls from family and strangers . this past summer , while the couple was walking in the streets in damascus , a car tried to run them over . `` i was able to pull myself away , but my husband could n't , '' sami recalls . `` the car hit his leg and he fell to the ground . '' there is no doubt that it was a deliberate attempt to kill them . two hours after the attack , sami 's phone rang . `` there was a man who said this time you could have made it , you could have survived , but the next time you will not . '' the couple fled to turkey a few months ago , but they ca n't shake the fear that their relationship could cost them their lives . they share housing with other syrian refugees , where they have to continue to pretend that they are straight . when the isis photographs emerged , one of their housemates made a sickening comment . `` he made an absurd joke about how he was so amused , had too much fun watching homosexuals . he says now gay men can fly . '' they say they will never return to syria . and neither will nour . `` it 's too damaging for my psychological state , because i have been abused too much from my family , friends , school . it 's not safe for me psychologically or physically , '' he says . opinion : isis 's warped take on morality .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the islamic state of iraq and syria is making headlines again . on wednesday , images began circulating from the city of raqqa in syria of a man being thrown off a building , allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act . the scene is sickening and horrifying . and it 's meant to be , because isis is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like , do , or say . this latest execution is the eighth that isis has claimed it carried out for sodomy . in addition , the syrian observatory for human rights -lrb- sohr -rrb- has reported the murders of four more men , also accused of sodomy , who were killed in similar style by isis in syria . isis is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in syria accused of adultery . it 's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize . some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death -lrb- and in some cases both -rrb- . in its social media postings about the executions , isis shows victims being brought to a city center , with militants purporting to read from a self-styled `` court '' ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd . a final picture usually depicts a lifeless body . the militia 's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention : to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror . the international gay and lesbian human rights commission -lrb- iglhrc -rrb- , of course , condemns these acts . but it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves . indeed , despite our efforts , and those of other independent observers , neither the accusations nor the exact nature , time , and location of the executions can be corroborated . we know nothing about the victims ' sexual orientation or gender identity . without evidence or independent confirmation , we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved . still , whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases , as iglhrc and the women 's rights organization madre have asserted , the public and gruesome nature of these executions , and isis 's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be `` sodomy , '' raise concerns for anyone in iraq or syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about `` proper '' women and men . and the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under isis 's control . for iraqi individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms , living under the rule of isis means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence , as pointed out in our report with madre and the baghdad-based organization of women 's freedom in iraq . where do we go from here ? there are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of isis . the antidote to their bleak worldview will be long-term and hard-won , rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities . however , the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today . internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to u.n. agencies and human rights ngos who work directly with vulnerable people . meanwhile , applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited . we can not sit idly by while isis commits wanton violence in the name of protecting `` morality .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- many years ago , a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by `` amazon mom , '' a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts , recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years . in bold print , the company says the program is `` open to anyone , whether you 're a mom , dad , grandparent , or caretaker . '' but still it is called `` amazon mom , '' irking my colleague 's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies . ` dad ' gets a makeover in super bowl ads . my friend 's husband was not alone . a petition created a few years ago calls on amazon to change the name of the program from `` amazon mom '' to `` amazon family . '' but the drive did n't get much traction . that changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger , oren miller , who created a facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members . in 2013 , miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get amazon to change the name of the program . `` why did amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the uk ? what made them realize they could n't get away with calling it ` amazon mom , ' and why do they get away with it here ? '' miller wrote . `` someone actually started a petition to change the name to ` amazon family ' in the us , and so far it has less than 100 signatures . why is that ? why are we ok with letting england be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood ? they have a queen ! they are ruled by a freakin ' queen ! we can do better than that ! '' he wrote . no more dumb old dad : changing the bumbling father stereotype . i had the pleasure of interviewing miller for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit . the 42-year-old stay-at-home father of two , who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog , was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014 . miller , of owings mills , maryland , died saturday . now , members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor , trying to step up the pressure on the internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times . mike heenan , a stay-at-home father of two in northern california and founder of the blog at-home dad matters , never got to meet miller but says that when miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers , it changed his life . `` he got me writing again , inspired me to publish , to contribute , to tell my story ... to be a better dad for my daughters . '' heenan , like several other dad bloggers , took to twitter using the #amazonfamilyus hashtag to call for amazon to make the change . `` the push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and , like oren , many of us think the change to ` amazon family ' is a no-brainer , '' heenan said . judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad . buzz bishop , a father of two in calgary , alberta , and founder of the blog dad camp , points out how amazon calls its program `` amazon family '' in germany , japan , austria , france and canada as well as the united kingdom . `` so why is it called ` amazon mom ' in america ? '' bishop wrote in a blog post . `` we are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the dad bloggers facebook group , oren miller , '' wrote bishop . `` in his name , we want to finish the job . '' the petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures . amazon has not commented on the movement . in the meantime , miller 's supporters wo n't stop pushing . i hope they never do . do you think amazon should re-name its `` amazon mom '' program `` amazon family '' ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the two years since `` lean in '' became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality , author sheryl sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men : what can they do ? now the facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet . if lebron james is encouraging men to lean in for women , do n't you think some of his 19 million twitter followers will get the message too ? that 's certainly what sandberg and her leanin.org colleagues are hoping , following their brand new partnership with the national basketball association and the women 's national basketball association and the creation of a public service campaign called #leanintogether . in a 30-second video of nba and wnba all-stars , we see james of the cleveland cavaliers holding up a poster , which says `` all-star dad . '' dwayne wade of the miami heat says , `` when men lean in , everyone wins , '' and then touts how he leans in for his wife , mother and grandmother . `` help women aim high , '' says al horford of the atlanta hawks . the significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold , says sandberg . to truly bring about equality at home and at work , men need to be part of the discussion , and we need to bring the discussion to where men are , she says . sheryl sandberg at blogher : not every woman has to be a ceo . `` the conversation about equality has long existed by women , for women , in women 's forums where women are , and that will continue , and that 's important . but bringing it to the center of the court , bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like lebron james and steph curry -lrb- of the golden state warriors -rrb- and dwayne wade , saying ` i 'm in for equality and here 's why ' -- i think that could be transformative , '' said sandberg in a phone interview . what sandberg and leanin.org are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do , providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work , and as managers , as soon as they finish reading this story . many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50-50 in household and child care duties at home . but sandberg says with the list of `` simple , clear , everyday things , practical things '' men can do that are based on real data , men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit . for instance , research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier , mentally and physically , happier , have stronger emotional attachments and relationships , are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home , sandberg said . for girls , there 's an extra benefit , she said . by age 14 , if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework , her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who do n't see their fathers doing household chores , she said , pointing to a study by the university of british columbia and published in a journal of the association for psychological science . `` the way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level , no matter how active a mother is , do better -- a lot of men , particularly those with wives who are home -lrb- and who say -rrb- ` i 'm covered . my kids are in good hands ' ... they are motivated , '' said sandberg . despite ` lean in , ' workplace equality remains abysmal . dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want , but if mom is still doing all the cooking and cleaning , their girls are n't getting the full message . `` what really matters is seeing what you do . you have to walk the walk . she needs to see equality to believe it . '' another huge goal , sandberg says , is showing men they wo n't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms . `` if you 've long been in the majority and long held power , and you see change , you could naturally be nervous that this was n't going to help you , '' said sandberg . men need to realize it 's not a zero sum game , she said . `` when companies do better , there are more jobs , more promotions , more salaries for everyone . when companies do worse , there 's less for everyone , '' she said . she mentioned a recent study by the international monetary fund , which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the u.s. , our country 's gross domestic product would grow by 5 % . `` we have n't seen 5 % gdp growth in a long time . ... that 's a lot of jobs for a lot of people , so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone , i think , is huge . '' work-life balance not just a women 's issue . sandberg 's #leanintogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality . sandberg will be one of the opening night speakers at a four-day conference on engaging men and boys that begins thursday in new york . the conference is sponsored by the center for the study of men and masculinities at stony brook university . in january , a u.n. conference sponsored by iceland and suriname , which i was honored to attend as a panel participant , brought together ambassadors , other policymakers , and athletes and artists , with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality . an overriding message repeated at the conference was that we ca n't keep telling men what to do . we need to show them what many men are already doing every day at home and at work . `` dad ' gets a makeover in super bowl ads . that is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year 's super bowl was so applauded by men like sociologist michael kimmel , who is spearheading this week 's new york conference on men and masculinities . `` this provides a counternarrative to all the action hero , buffoon images that we see , '' kimmel told me when i talked to him days before the super bowl . kimmel said very few men , fewer than 10 % , can relate to the way the media depict masculinity , according to a study conducted by dove men + care . kimmel was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research . men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in american history , and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well , said kimmel , who is the author of more than 20 books including `` manhood in america : a cultural history . '' sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like james and wade goes a long way toward doing that . `` i am increasingly convinced that unless we fully accept men as caregivers , we ca n't fully accept women as leaders , '' she said . `` we 've got to stop calling it ` mommy and me . ' as long as we are calling it ` mommy and me , ' we are communicating to women that this is their job ... and we have to do both sides of this . '' admittedly impatient about gender equality -lrb- i 'm impatient too ! -rrb- , sandberg concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and leanin.org can close its doors . `` we have been fighting for equality for too long , '' she said , noting that women starting earning about 50 % of college degrees back in 1981 . `` thirty-four years is plenty of time to get 50 % of the top jobs , and we 're not close . we 're at 5 -lrb- % -rrb- in the fortune 500 . and so we have to change , we have to change more . we have to get more people involved .

'' @mayormark you better get each and every one of us a therapist after all of stress you 're causing us , '' wrote one . `` the kids take it tongue in cheek . they understand , because it 's sort of a tradition around here , '' said boughton , who told cnn he 's been trading jokes about snow days with students on twitter for several years now . `` we go back and forth . but it 's all in good fun . '' one twist of the whole thing is that boughton does n't even make the call about closing danbury schools . that decision is left to superintendent of schools sal pascarella , who confers with boughton by phone and then sends an automated update to every parent 's phone . but boughton , who ran for governor of connecticut last year and has 18,000 twitter followers , usually posts his school-closing tweets first . finally , after hours of build-up , the mayor gave people of danbury the news at 6:21 a.m. wednesday : schools would open two hours late . the mayor says he wants to help young people engage with public servants -- and show them that he can be funny . `` i have a very serious policy side ... but i like to have a good chuckle , '' he said . `` that 's who i am . in the end , i think it -lrb- social media -rrb- is about being yourself . '' he says he rarely gets complaints about his twitter feed , and that `` parents think it 's hysterical . '' but maybe not all danbury parents . `` as a parent , has it been helpful ? no , '' said stephanie pabon , whose 6-year-old son attends a danbury magnet school . `` because as a parent i do n't have time for twitter . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- patrick and sue ellen kilgallon knew the storm was coming . they tried to get out of northern kentucky on wednesday night . instead , they got stuck in the snow on interstate 65 . the florida couple and their two dogs were still there thursday morning , more than 14 hours later , unable to get back to the sunshine state . `` we 're just sitting here praying , hoping to get out , '' patrick kilgallon told cnn on thursday . they were among hundreds of motorists who had been stranded on i-65 near elizabethtown , kentucky , and on interstate 24 near paducah after a storm so intense that road crews just could n't keep up . gov. steve beshear said thursday afternoon that some traffic had begun to inch along . `` we have finally cleared some emergency lanes on the sides of the roads , and the traffic now northbound on i-65 is beginning to move slowly and to clear out , '' he told cnn . `` it will take several hours to clear it out , because it 's backed up so much . but it is moving again , thank goodness . '' video shot from news helicopters above the interstate showed that by 4 p.m. , cars and many tractor-trailers were rolling along , once they cleared a hill near elizabethtown . but in some places , the vehicles that still had gas had to maneuver around those that did n't . and thursday evening , traffic was still at a standstill in hart county between mile markers 71 and 74 , the kentucky transportation cabinet said . the kentucky national guard was helping motorists , taking some to nearby warming centers and returning others to their cars where the highways were passable , lt. col. kirk hilbrecht told cnn . 94 million americans say : ` enough with winter , already ' beshear told cnn that officials had been prepared . `` we did everything we could in advance , '' he said . there were no reports of any deaths or major injuries , the governor said . `` i-65 was literally a parking lot for 15 hours , '' said rev. janette wilson , who was stuck on the highway while headed from chicago to selma , alabama . `` the thing that troubles me the most was the lack of preparedness for the storm and the inability of the kentucky emergency response team to investigate ... the impact on people on the road . '' no one checked whether people had run out of food or gas , or gave those stranded an update , she told cnn 's anderson cooper . wilson said they were stuck on the road and not moving between 2:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. . a morning weather report indicated that over a 15-hour span , 21 inches of snow had fallen on elizabethtown , about 50 miles south of louisville . other parts of kentucky , along with parts of ohio to the north and tennessee to the south , had more than a foot of snow . the kentucky transportation cabinet published a hotline number for motorists stranded on the highway . the kilgallons gassed up wednesday night and tried to beat the storm as they traveled south for florida . but 25 miles from louisville , they hit `` nothing but dead stop '' on i-65 . kilgallon has a scanner in the car and said she has heard that a tractor-trailer collided with several cars , and while the truck was moved , there were not enough tow trucks to move the other vehicles involved in the accident . the kilgallons had a few snacks left and are rationing the water they have left , patrick kilgallon said thursday afternoon . they ran the engine on their new jeep all night to keep warm and prevent the ice from encrusting the car too deeply , he said . asked whether she was upset with kentucky officials , sue ellen kilgallon said no . `` i think they 're doing the best they can , '' she said . `` i 'd cry if it were n't so amusing .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- it was a sophisticated attack with sophisticated devices . authorities quickly identified the boston bombing suspects , but almost immediately after tamerlan tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt for the perpetrators and dzhokhar tsarnaev was captured , investigators privately questioned if more people were involved . if there were others , perhaps a bomb maker is on the loose . dzhokhar tsarnaev told police he and his brother built the bombs , but court documents show some people involved in the case had their doubts . the bombs were described as powerful pressure-cooker explosives controlled remotely . there were fuses from christmas lights and detonators constructed from model car parts . the twin bombings in april 2013 killed three people and wounded more than 250 others . `` these relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others , '' prosecutors wrote in a filing opposing a move by tsarnaev 's lawyer to throw out statements he made in the hospital . two years after the attack michael marks , a former special agent for the naval criminal investigative service , agrees on the technical aspects of the bombs . `` these were two relatively sophisticated devices that went off almost simultaneously . they had a very , very short delay , '' he said . `` it would be my opinion that they had somebody who was more of a skilled bomb maker , an engineer if you will , assist them in saying these are the steps you need to go through and then assemble the device to make it safely and to make it function the way they want . '' they were the kind of bombs that need testing to make sure they work the way you expect . `` there has been no evidence that the two brothers actually tested and tried out making a bomb and detonating it , '' cnn national security analyst juliette kayyem said . `` now it could be luck that they put this thing together , put it at the boston marathon finish line , and were able to detonate them so close to each other and sequentially . but it was a pretty sophisticated attack . '' dzhokhar tsarnaev told fbi agents he and his brother built the bombs following instructions from al qaeda 's inspire magazine . no one has been publicly named as a possible co-conspirator . investigators have focused on tamerlan tsarnaev 's suspected ties to militants . in 2012 the older tsarnaev spent six months in russia . authorities have questioned how much exposure he may have had to radicals and whether he could have received training there . there are other clues that the brothers would have needed help with the bombs . there was n't trace evidence -- black powder from fireworks -- found in either home , their cars or anywhere associated with them , the court documents said . also , investigators apparently were troubled that they recovered one remote-controlled detonator at the scene of the bombings when there should have been two . that suggested the other was being kept to use with other bombs . marks said investigators did n't find circuit testers . `` you want a separate circuit tester in order to test the functionality of the components without it being hooked up to the actual device , for your own safety , '' he said . the trial underway in boston will center on not whether dzhokhar tsarnaev did it , but why he did it . the prosecution will paint a portrait of a cruel co-conspirator , an equal partner in hideous crimes . a man who planned to kill and did . but the defense will draw the accused as a boy living in the shadow of a mastermind older brother . younger , struggling in school , abandoned by his parents . an easy victim of deep manipulation . the question of how he was influenced is essential to the case . kayyem , who said she believes the brothers acted in tandem without outside help , said she think the defense strategy will be to create enough doubt within the jurors ' minds of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's mental state leading into this . `` so this idea that there might be some evil hand out there telling dzhokhar what to do -- whether it 's his brother or someone who 's a bomb maker -- fits nicely into that narrative , '' she said .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- they were not-so-affectionately dubbed the `` bed-wetters '' by then-obama senior adviser david plouffe . the definition : democrats who run to the hills every time there 's a bump in the road . the chicken littles . the woe-is-us crowd . well , they 're at it again . not surprisingly , it 's because of the hillary clinton email brouhaha , an unforced error that is now ricocheting around the political world . and the home team stands in place , just watching , somewhat stunned . but democrats do n't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out . hillary clinton is their candidate ; their putative nominee . `` their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible , '' says one senior democratic strategist . `` and from time to time , this may require an intervention . '' now might be a good time . but while the anxious democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs -- and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup -- they might do well to look at themselves . over the past six years , there 's been a sharp structural decline of elected democrats everywhere below the presidential level . sure , we all know about how the republicans regained control of the senate in 2014 , but what about the fact that blue-state governors fell like tent poles ? or that gop governors now outnumber the democrats by almost two-to-one , 31 to 18 . or that republicans have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the democrats , 30 to 11 . and down the ballot , democrats under obama have lost more than 900 state legislative seats : the worst showing of any modern president . that 's eye-popping . so , the conventional judgment that the clinton behemoth is just too big -- too well funded , too well supported , too historic -- all helps account for the paucity of alternatives , to be sure . but there 's much , much more to it than the phenom of bigfoot hillary . it 's the phenom of barack obama , too -- and the very strong counterforces he 's generated around the country . the gains at the presidential level have not been cost-free : the country is polarized , the democrats are often on defense and they 're losing ground . one result : a thin presidential bench , which is painfully evident . clinton asks state to release emails : what you need to know . and if you take a peek at those blue-state governors who might be president , consider this : at 76 , jerry brown , an able leader , is probably past his sell-by date for a presidential bid . new york gov. andrew cuomo has made very few moves to raise his national profile . and democratic governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland . any time you have republicans winning the gubernatorial races in massachusetts , illinois and maryland , democrats should pay attention . as has been the case with other presidents , for obama party-building has not been on top of the agenda . but it shows . and so when hillary clinton runs into some trouble , the democrats ought to worry . the republicans have a deep and varied field ; the democrats have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate . speaking of hillary clinton , part of the problem right now is situational . those democrats who want to defend her say there 's a problem -- they 're not quite sure what they 're defending , because they 're not sure exactly what happened , or why . in other words , the wagons are circled , but the surrogates are left outside . next , while team clinton may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy -lrb- why not let the gop battle it out ? no need to give the gop early target practice ? -rrb- , the downside is now obvious : how do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond ? if you 're out there making personal appearances , it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room . no matter how much you tweet about it . clinton 's stumbles fuel democratic critics . bottom line , there is no organized pushback and there is no plan b. -lrb- ok , jim webb , martin o'malley and bernie sanders , we know who you are , and that you 're probably running , but still . -rrb- or at least no big plan b . the pre-presidential league on the democratic side is not exactly overflowing with big-time candidates . -lrb- unless you think vice president joe biden is running or secretary of state john kerry is running , which they likely are not . same for massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren . -rrb- . so `` bed-wetters , '' beware . the truth is simple : your job is to defend hillary clinton , not to bury her . yes , it can be hard . even annoying . but think about it this way : if you do n't , her problems become your own .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you were the member of a minority group and tried to create a system to control and oppress the majority , you could not have done a better job than the white leaders of ferguson , missouri . let 's start with the demographics . ferguson is small -- roughly 20,000 residents -- and is 67 % black and 29 % white . over the past decade , ferguson 's population has changed from majority white to majority black . its elected officials did not . five of six city council members are white , as is the city 's mayor . how does this happen in a city two-thirds black ? two answers : timing of elections and type of elections . ferguson , like most municipalities , holds elections in april of odd-numbered years . however research shows that such `` off-cycle '' elections reduces voter turnout . ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections , which means that there are no party labels on the ballot . this not only reduces the likelihood that people will vote , it also has been shown to reduce what voters know about the candidates . although missouri does not track the race of its voters , according to an article in the washington post , catalist , a private voter data firm , performed a study and found that the voting rules operating in ferguson effectively suppress the black vote . in the national election in november 2012 , the study found , voter turnout between blacks -lrb- 54 % -rrb- and whites -lrb- 55 % -rrb- was virtually identical . but because of the vast racial differences in the city 's population , it resulted in an electorate that was 71 % black and 28 % white . fast-forward five months later in april , when whites were three times -lrb- 17 % -rrb- more likely to vote than blacks -lrb- 6 % -rrb- . that resulted in an electorate that was majority white : 52 % versus 47 % . that is how a majority-black population winds up with almost all-white elected representatives . ferguson 's law enforcement officers are also not representative , with roughly 94 % of its police force being white . similarly ferguson 's local judges are nonrepresentative . i 'm sensing a pattern here . local judges are appointed by the ferguson city council upon nomination by the mayor for a two-year term . the ferguson municipal court is also all-white . but the black citizens of ferguson apparently keep the police and local judges very busy . in 2013 , ferguson had the highest number of warrants issued in the state , when you control for size : 3.6 pending arrest warrants per household and 2.2 arrest warrants on average per person . and 95 % of people arrested for jaywalking in ferguson are black . while 67 % of the population is black , 86 % of vehicle stops involve a black driver . while 29 % of the population is white , 12.9 % of vehicle stops involve a white driver . blacks were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites , even though searches of blacks were less likely than whites to result in contraband being found -lrb- 21 % vs. 34 % -rrb- . nobody said racism made sense . but for ferguson , it has made money . in prior years ferguson tried to raise sales tax but learned the hard way that it did not result in increased revenue because people voted with their feet and took their wealth with them . ferguson turned to a different revenue source : collecting traffic fines and penalties from the largely black population . those revenues constitute ferguson 's second-highest revenue source . once a resident gets a ticket and does not appear in court with an explanation , an arrest warrant is likely issued . once arrested , the resident may sit in jail for a very long time , while the fees and fines continue to accrue . a class-action lawsuit filed this month against the city of ferguson has challenged this funding system , calling it a `` modern debtors ' prison scheme . '' the remarkable part of this story is how patient the black residents of ferguson have been . it took the death of a teenager to get them mad enough to protest and the nation got mad with them . between the class-action lawsuit and the department of justice 's involvement , blacks in ferguson should know the world is watching . the arc of history is long and bends towards justice -- and help is finally on the way .
hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- china says its military budget will increase by 10.1 % in 2015 , the latest in a series of double-digit increases that will narrow the still-significant gap with the united states on defense spending . according to a budget report released at the start of china 's national people 's congress - the annual meeting of the country 's rubber stamp parliament -- defense spending will total 887 billion yuan -lrb- $ 144.2 billion -rrb- this year . `` building a solid national defense and strong armed forces is fundamental to safeguarding china 's sovereignty , '' premier li keqiang told thousands of delegates gathered in the cavernous great hall of the people in beijing 's tiananmen square . the increase underscores china 's intention to prioritize military spending even as economic growth slows . it also comes amid unease among china 's neighbors about the pursuit of its territorial claims in the south china sea and east china sea . traditionally , the people 's liberation army army has been focused on protecting its own borders , but recent missions have seen it join u.n. peacekeeping efforts in places like south sudan , and fighting piracy in somalia . analysts say that china 's spending on defense is notoriously opaque and the budget includes paramilitary forces such as the people 's armed police as well as the people 's liberation army , navy and air force . paul burton , asia pacific director at ihs aerospace , defence & security , estimates that actual spending is 35 % higher than the announced budget . `` china 's expanding strategic reach and extensive modernization requirements will continue to require significant investment over the next decade , '' burton said . china 's defense budget is still dwarfed by what the u.s. spends on its military -- $ 598 billion , according to 2014 figures provided by ihs . but , while china 's budget has increased by double digits every year since 2010 , u.s. spending has declined since then . china 's defense budget grew by 12.7 % in 2011 , 11.2 % in 2012 , and 10.7 % in 2013 , according to china 's state news agency xinhua . alexander neill , a senior fellow at the international institute of strategic studies in singapore says china is likely to prioritize spending on its naval power -- its force has traditionally been focused on winning land battles . `` a growing chunk of budget is going toward china 's navy , particularly its submarine force and its seaborne nuclear deterrent , '' he said . china 's first aircraft carrier went into service in 2012 and a second is thought to be under construction . neill also said that the pla is likely to make its pay more competitive to attract higher quality recruits , such as college graduates . a u.s. congressional report released last month said that many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education . it added that the country 's one-child policy , which has created the `` little emperor '' phenomenon of spoiled children , produces recruits who `` may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline , '' the report added . `` serving in the military , in a chinese cultural sense , is not a sought-after professional career , '' neill said . `` if the pla can offer competitive salaries , they may be able to attract a new stratum of specialist talent .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a 17-year-old virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for isis , federal law enforcement officials said wednesday . the teen , whose name was not disclosed , was taken into custody last week , the officials said . prosecutors are seeking to charge him as an adult but currently have charged him as a juvenile , one of the law enforcement officials said . the case remains under seal . it was first reported by the washington post on wednesday . the post , citing officials and neighbors , reported that investigators spent more than a month watching the teen and his home before he was arrested . the teen , who lives in a virginia suburb of washington , is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to syria . the adult is believed to have joined isis there , a separate law enforcement official said . the teen is also accused of distributing isis messages to a network of contacts , one of the officials said . the teen is an `` intelligent kid , '' a man who hired him to write for a digital currency news website said wednesday evening . dustin o'bryant , the editor of the website coin brief from alabama , said : `` he did not come across as radical in any way . '' the teen wrote freelance articles for the website for seven months last year . he was told not to bring religion into his writing , o'bryant said , adding he had noticed the young man had written online posts about his faith . the teen complied , he said . the website editor said he was `` extremely , extremely surprised '' to learn of the arrest from reporters calling him . he had n't spoken to the teen since february , when the young man said he was dealing with personal matters but wanted to start writing for the website again at some point this year . give me two weeks to three months , the boy told him . o'bryant said he is shocked by the charge . `` i hope there 's some sort of misunderstanding here , and that he did n't know what he was doing , '' he said . he added that he did n't realize the teen was in high school because he had college courses on his resume . more than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for isis , the radical islamist group that controls portions of iraq and syria , experts have told congress . national intelligence director james clapper said 180 americans have tried to go to fight in syria . it 's unclear how many of those were attempting to join isis . it was also unknown if the man the teen allegedly helped is a u.s. citizen . the names : who has been recruited to isis from the west . others have been prevented from going there or providing support . also wednesday , a 21-year-old california man arrested last summer was indicted , changed with attempting to support terror and other counts . adam dandach , of orange , california , was accused by the fbi in the indictment of attempting to provide himself and material support to work under the direction and control of isis . he will be arraigned march 16 . california man accused of trying to join isis . in february , three men from new york -- abdurasul juraboev , 24 ; akhror saidakhmetov , 19 ; and abror habibov , 30 -- were arrested and charged with conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization . an unsealed criminal complaint accused one of the men of discussing a potential attempt to assassinate president barack obama . one had discussed hijacking a flight and handing it over to isis , the complaint said . four women from colorado have been accused of attempting to join isis . three denver teenagers , who investigators say were recruited via social media , were stopped in germany in october and sent back to the united states . after being arrested in spring 2014 , shannon maureen conley was one of the first americans sentenced for conspiracy to support isis . two men who have appeared in horrific isis propaganda videos could be from the united states or canada , according to analysts . the individuals , both of whom are shown wearing masks covering everything but their eyes , spoke in what sounded like north american accents . one was in a video entitled `` flames of war , '' which shows the execution of a handful of men . the other militant is the speaker in isis ' first propaganda video out of libya , which ends with the graphic beheading of more than a dozen egyptian christians . cnn 's brian todd and pamela brown reported from washington . cnn 's shimon prokupecz reported from new york .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- as a manager at several prominent media outlets , katharine zaleski did not understand the demands on working moms and often belittled their work ethic . then she became a mom , and everything changed . in a widely shared piece this week for fortune.com , the journalist-turned-startup executive apologizes for disparaging the mothers she worked with in her 20s at the huffington post and washington post . zaleski said she committed multiple `` infractions , '' against these women , including scheduling late-afternoon meetings or happy hours without considering that mothers with after-work responsibilities would n't be able to attend . she even did n't disagree `` when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she ` got pregnant . ' '' now a mother to a young daughter , zaleski said she was wrong to undervalue mothers ' contributions by counting hours logged in the office and not the actual work done . `` i wish i had known five years ago , as a young , childless manager , that mothers are the people you need on your team , '' she wrote . `` there 's a saying that ` if you want something done then ask a busy person to do it . ' that 's exactly why i like working with mothers now . '' zaleski 's piece has been shared more than 1,000 times and has been hailed on social media by many commenters who applaud her for seeing the error of her ways . `` your message is so important and it 's about time it was addressed , '' said heather bouvier on twitter . `` thank you for writing this . there are so many people like your then-childless 28-year-old self who need to read it . seriously , thank you from the bottom of my heart , '' wrote alice gomstyn on facebook . since the essay was published tuesday , zaleski told cnn she 's received more than 2,000 emails from readers who admit they 've committed similar infractions in the workplace . `` i 'm so motivated and thrilled , '' she said . `` i could n't be more psyched for the responses . '' but not all the responses have been positive . some people refuse to accept zaleski 's apology and accuse her of borrowing from similar apologetic essays by other new moms . `` this woman has basically stolen another woman 's post about her views on mothers with children in the workforce for her own personal gain !! , '' wrote one commenter on zaleski 's essay . others accuse zaleski of writing the essay just to promote the new company she co-founded , power to fly , an online platform that matches women with technical skills to freelance projects they can do from anywhere . `` this woman & her shameless self-promoting article disgust me . no awareness . no integrity , '' kitten holiday said on twitter . zaleski said that notion is `` just silly , '' and she 's taken a huge risk leaving a stable job to start a company that is a part of the solution . zaleski said her company , which launched in august , enables women to work from home so that they can `` be valued for their productivity and not time spent sitting in an office or at a bar bonding afterwards . '' but some critics say encouraging mothers to work from home only perpetuates a problem . `` i like this article a lot , but wish the solution was n't to have a company that helps mothers find jobs that keep them tucked away at home , but to change the dominant culture to create better , more supportive workplaces where flexible schedules are encouraged , '' said suzanne pekow carlson on facebook . others say they wish zaleski went further , and instead of only addressing the challenges of the working mother , wished she 'd included other caregivers , like dads . `` i hope the convo ... expands beyond just working moms to working dads , folks taking care of sick parents , etc. , '' abc 's karen travers said on twitter . `` i do n't understand why we still refuse to acknowledge that our society needs to be more flexible for parents . it is not just the woman 's burden , '' said margaret weingart berger on facebook . and said another commenter on zaleski 's essay , `` if it takes this woman becoming a mother to understand the value of working mothers and have compassion for them , then i guess we ca n't expect men to understand and have compassion because they will never be able to be mothers themselves . '' zaleski said she finds the criticism `` frustrating , '' but said she refuses to dwell on the negative . she wants to `` stay focused on helping women find fulfilling work they can do from home . '' she said her essay represents her `` own personal experience , '' which happens to mostly involve working with mothers . but she 's glad her piece has opened a dialogue and she hopes the conversation continues . women not supporting women `` is a systemic problem in our society , '' zaleski said . serena markstrom nugent , posting on facebook , agreed . `` to the women mad at her -lrb- zaleski -rrb- and saying too little too late : she not only had not had kids but was very young and ambitious . in the spirit of not tearing down other women , i would say cheer her on for where she is on in the journey , '' she wrote . `` still young , still learning , and at least at this point , it appears , part of the solution . '' still other critics suggest the issue is n't as simple as parents versus non-parents in the workplace . instead , they say , it 's about the lack of empathy that exists between colleagues whose circumstances are different from their own . `` why is it necessary to ` walk in someone 's shoes ' before we understand their perspective ? '' said ann oconnell on facebook . `` until we strive to have understanding and compassion for people regardless of our personal circumstances or life choices , we will remain selfish and self-centered as a whole . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a suspect from ohio learned a valuable lesson this week : do n't taunt authorities on social media , especially when you 're a wanted man . andrew marcum , 21 , jumped in and posted his two cents after authorities shared his picture on facebook as a featured warrant of the week . allegations against the lemon township resident included burglary , kidnapping , domestic violence and criminal endangering , the butler county sheriff 's office posted in a message accompanying its post . apparently not intent on going down without a fight , a man bearing the name andrew marcum responded to the post . `` i ai n't tripping half of them do n't even know me , '' he posted . in addition to sharing the suspect 's name , the facebook account is several years old and had other photos resembling marcum , including one with a large tattoo spelling his last name on his back . authorities took the man 's post seriously enough to respond to it . `` andrew marcum , if you could stop by the sheriff 's office , that 'd be great , '' they posted . sheriff richard k. jones raised the stakes by moving their pleas to twitter . he posted a picture of a jail cell that apparently awaited the suspect . marcum 's purported post appeared monday , and authorities arrested him a day later . `` thanks to our social media friends for helping turn up the heat on this week 's featured warrant , '' the sheriff 's office tweeted . `` marcum in custody . '' jones posted the suspect 's arrest mug shot , showing him in tears .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- after months racing not only to treat ebola but to find ways to prevent it , health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease . the trial , using vaccines developed by the public health agency of canada , will be administered in basse guinee , a region that has had the highest number of ebola cases in guinea . another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study , according to a press release from the world health organization , medecins sans frontieres -lrb- doctors without borders -rrb- , and the norwegian institute of public health . `` we have worked hard to reach this point , '' who director-general dr. margaret chan said . '' ... if a vaccine is found effective , it will be the first preventive tool against ebola in history . '' patient zero -- i.e. the first case in the current ebola outbreak -- is thought to be a 2-year-old guinean boy who contracted the virus in december 2013 and died a few days later . since then , the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by who have come in guinea and neighboring liberia and sierra leone . there are new ebola cases every day , including 132 in the last week of february -lrb- which is up from 99 reported the previous week -rrb- . while liberia did n't have any of these new incidences , guinea did -- especially in forecariah and conakry . still , authorities in africa and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease . the progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases , with january 's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities ' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic . this positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control , public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices . but the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive . that 's why , over the past six months , who has been working with scientists , ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting ebola in the first place . health workers in the guinea trial will start with a new ebola case and then trace all of that patient 's contacts , giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated . john-arne rottingen , from the norwegian institute of public health , said this program is happening at the request of guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there `` vital '' to its success . `` the ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we can not let our guard down until we reach zero cases , '' who official marie-paule kieny said . `` an effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- ben carson suggested to cnn on wednesday that prisons can turn straight people gay . former arkansas governor mike huckabee called being gay a lifestyle choice , like drinking alcohol . i guess the next thing these two presumed 2016 presidential hopefuls will tell america is being black is a choice , too . like it or not , it 's no wonder jeb bush is emerging as the republican party 's 2016 frontrunner . of course , there is that awkward little name thing , something he seems fully aware of -- despite only being in the exploratory phase of a potential campaign , jeb has already declared he 's not just another bush . `` a lot of people know my dad , they know my brother . as in everybody 's family , we 're all a little different , '' he reportedly told a crowd in las vegas this week . and he seems to keep trying to distance himself from his family . `` do you have brothers and sisters ? are you exactly the same ? '' he insisted . yet jeb is banking hard on the same vault of donors and operatives his father george h. w bush and his brother george w. bush used in their presidential campaigns . he 's already raising lots of money , asking donors recently not to give more than a still eye-popping $ 1 million to his super pac . `` they did n't need to be persuaded , '' howard leach , a republican fundraiser for jeb , told the washington post . so , what exactly is in a name like bush ? apparently , a whole lot of cash , which helps win presidential nominations and elections . and if jeb wins the nomination in 2016 , it will likely be less `` joyfully , '' as he promised last year , than ruthlessly . after all , we 're still more than 18 months from the election and jeb 's locking in many of the same kinds of consultants that worked with his brother and father . `` those who hold out can sense a distinct chill , '' noted a recent new york times article . jeb 's campaign is seeking to hire `` donors , advisors and operatives , '' wrote the times , with `` deep connections to the bush family 's past presidential campaigns and administrations . '' those same family members from whom jeb swears he 's different ? and if consultants do n't abide by jeb 's rules of loyalty and decide to work with other 2016 republican aspirants ? `` swift rebuke follows , '' the times notes , pointing to the example of imge , a technology company that reportedly fell out of favor with the bush campaign after one of the firm 's founders indicated imge was hoping not to be tied to a single candidate . none of this is to suggest that jeb bush does n't have appeal as a candidate -- i like some of the things he did as florida governor , like his record of cutting $ 19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs . -lrb- although i 'm not a fan of his willingness to grant illegal immigrants amnesty in any shape , fashion or form . -rrb- he seems more equipped to lead america and get things done than some others in the already cramped horse race like new jersey gov. chris christie , who seems more concerned with telling people off than sounding presidential . then there 's rick santorum and huckabee , caring christian men , but both too consumed with running for president of morality than bringing the entire country together after years of obama supposedly dividing us on race , religion and sexuality . but what troubles me a little about bush 's early attempts at `` corning the market '' is that he 's relying on the same consultants that have cycled through the last 20-plus years of elections -- some of whom worked for romney 's campaign . this raises the question of why , if jeb does n't want the public to view him as just another bush running for president , he seems to be relying on the bush network of consultants ? the same playbook that helped get his brother and father get elected president is n't going to work for this bush . the demographics of the country have changed , but it seems unlikely the republican party and its operatives have changed with it . the truth is that any republican candidate who wins the nomination will have to refrain from business as usual . he -lrb- let 's face it , the gop wo n't nominate a woman -rrb- will have to hire minorities and women in meaningful campaign positions and have a strategy to aggressively compete for minority votes . this is something romney did n't do nearly enough of . jeb is only in the `` pre-presidential '' phase , ruminating over the idea . but he appears to be assembling a lot of the same old -lrb- white -rrb- faces of recent losing republican campaigns we 've seen before . as a black conservative who would like to see a republican in the white house again , i hope jeb is n't romney 2.0 .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- foreign intervention in yemen 's chaos has dramatically raised the stakes in the arabian peninsula , threatening to expand what is already a civil war into a conflict pitting iran against saudi arabia and an arab coalition . the saudis launched operation `` decisive storm '' last wednesday with dozens of airstrikes in an effort to blunt the advance of houthi militia and allied army units on the port of aden -- and to protect the last bastion of yemen 's internationally-recognized president abd-rabbu mansour hadi . there were also strikes in and around the capital , sanaa , which resumed early monday . many analysts were surprised at the speed and scale of the saudi air campaign , which the kingdom said would continue until the houthis -- a shia minority that has swept across the country in the last six months -- retreated and laid down their arms . essentially the saudis are trying to bomb the houthis to the negotiating table . the houthis have responded by threatening a campaign of suicide bomb attacks inside saudi arabia . iran , which has supported the houthis as fellow shia , described the saudi offensive as a `` dangerous move that would kill any chance at peaceful resolution of the crisis . '' yemen is becoming the latest battleground in a contest for regional superiority between saudi arabia and iran that goes back to the overthrow of the shah during iran 's islamic revolution in 1979 . it now resembles syria , or bosnia 20 years ago : a patchwork of shifting fiefdoms where force is the only means of influence . there is a real risk that yemen will collapse as a state , with a revived independence movement in the south , the houthis in the north , and the sunni heartland in between . adam baron , a visiting fellow at the european council on foreign relations and expert on yemen 's tortured recent history , says , `` it 's not difficult to divine saudi arabia and its coalition partners ' motivations for taking this action . '' the houthis were on the verge of overrunning aden , a strategic port that overlooks straits through which 20,000 merchant ships pass every year . according to the u.s. energy information agency , 3.8 million barrels of oil a day passed through the bab el mandab straits in 2013 . but baron believes the kingdom 's `` decision to launch a full-scale military action truly risks inflaming the situation further . it will be seen as an act of aggression by most yemenis and risks taking the situation to a place that no-one will be able to control . '' as in afghanistan , factions in yemen do not respond well to foreign intervention . in 2009 the saudis took military action against the houthis in support of then president ali abdullah saleh , using airstrikes and special forces , but were unable to subdue them . now the houthis have at least some of the $ 500 million in military equipment provided by the u.s. to yemen since 2010 , and they have proved to be capable fighters . they staged a lightning invasion of the capital , sanaa , last september , taking advantage of popular discontent and an unwillingness among many army units to resist them . since then they have moved on the red sea port of hodeida and surged south toward aden . they have also grafted themselves onto parts of the army in the battle against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- that is now raging in central and southern yemen . whether saudi and egyptian ground forces will become involved in the conflict is the big unknown . an arab league summit in egypt at the weekend agreed to form a joint military force , but that will take months at least to build . in the meantime , saudi tanks and armor have been moved closer to the yemeni border , but saudi officials say there are no immediate plans to launch a ground offensive . yemen has history as a graveyard of foreign forces . in the 1960s egypt intervened in yemen 's civil war on behalf of the anti-royalists -- an operation that sapped the egyptian army and contributed to its failure against the israelis in the 1967 war . the extent of the houthis ' backing from iran is hotly disputed . president hadi said at the weekend that iran was behind yemen 's turmoil and the houthis were no more than its stooges . the houthis deny receiving help from iran , but as the conflict worsens , they may indeed turn to tehran for the sort of military advice that the iranian revolutionary guards are providing in iraq -- and for funding and oil . saudi and iranian involvement in yemen threatens to deepen sectarian distrust in a country where sunni and shia have historically not been enemies . this would suit both aqap and isis -lrb- islamic state in syria and iraq -rrb- which announced its sudden and murderous arrival in yemen this month with massive suicide bombings at two houthi mosques in sanaa , killing at least 150 people . as the international crisis group puts it , a `` long history of coexistence is beginning to break down '' in yemen . baron says one critical question is whether isis and aqap will now go head-to-head in trying to kill as many houthis as possible . for the united states , which worked hard to `` stand up '' the hadi government and encourage its campaign to eradicate aqap , recent events have been a disaster . there will be less actionable intelligence against one of al qaeda 's most potent affiliates , and its sunni allies in the middle east -lrb- and especially the gulf -rrb- will have even less interest than before in dialogue with iran on issues from its nuclear program to iraq . u.s. options have also diminished with the hurried withdrawal of some 100 military personnel from al-anad airbase in the south of yemen hours before it was seized by the houthis . drone operations from the base had at least blunted aqap 's freedom of action , even if they failed to eradicate the group . the unseen hand in yemen 's collapse is former president ali abdullah saleh , who was badly injured in a bomb attack in 2011 , and eventually -lrb- very eventually -rrb- persuaded to cede office to hadi after 33 years in power . but he was allowed to remain in the country and has not given up his political ambitions . last fall , he was sanctioned by both the united nations and the u.s. for undermining efforts to forge a new political settlement in yemen . baron believes saleh is biding his time -- waiting for an opportunity to inject his son , ahmed ali , into yemen 's complex political equation . ahmed ali was formerly commander of yemen 's republican guard , and parts of the armed forces are still regarded as loyal to the saleh clan . for now , saleh has a marriage of convenience with the houthis , but few expect it to survive . when he was president , saleh launched a series of brief wars against the houthis between 2004 and 2010 . `` neither trusts the other ; their recent cooperation notwithstanding , they are competing for political dominance , especially in the northern tribal highlands and the military , '' says the international crisis group . for the people of yemen , the brief flash of hope that came with the arab spring is now a distant memory . last week , at least nine protesters were killed in the central city of taiz and more than 100 injured by houthi militia . aden has been rocked by looting and score-settling among rival clans . `` human rights in yemen are in free-fall as even peaceful protest becomes a life-threatening activity , '' according to said boumedouha of amnesty international . for the past three years , different parties and factions have fought over the state 's few assets while the standard of living of ordinary yemenis has continued to plummet . a u.n.-led effort to agree on a new constitution has been mired in squabbling , with all parties failing to honor commitments . `` even more damaging , those with most influence -- the saudis and iranians in particular -- are taking steps to undercut the negotiations , '' says the international crisis group . `` this combination of proxy wars , sectarian violence , state collapse and militia rule has become sadly familiar in the region . nobody is likely to win such a fight , '' the icg says . but for now , such a fight seems destined to continue .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- australian cricket great shane warne has been criticized for promoting an unhealthy drinking culture , following post-match interviews at cricket 's world cup final in which he repeatedly quizzed players about their drinking plans . acting as part of the commentary team for australian broadcaster channel nine , warne interviewed the victorious australian players at the melbourne cricket ground in the wake of their comfortable win over new zealand . broadcast live and amplified throughout the stadium , the exchanges -- in which warne seemed preoccupied with how much the players planned to drink -- prompted a backlash on social media using the hashtag '' #thirsty . '' to wicketkeeper brad haddin , warne asked : `` you feeling thirsty ? '' he continued the theme with steve smith , asking : `` what about you , gon na have a bit of a drink tonight too smitty ? gon na get thirsty as well ? the boys are thirsty they seem . '' shane watson and josh hazlewood were subjected to a similar line of questioning : . `` so what 's the plan , besides lots of drink and that , how long 's that gon na last ? just one night , two nights ? '' asked warne . the comments sparked an immediate reaction on twitter , with users criticizing warne for setting a poor example to young cricket fans , and one labeling him a `` bogan '' -- australasian slang for an unsophisticated person -- for his line of questioning . some twitter users played on warne 's publicized fondness for the tinder dating app , which has seen the former cricketer hit the headlines in recent times . not all responses were critical , with british journalist piers morgan among those coming to warne 's defense . warne , a noted bon vivant who was often photographed with drink in hand after wins during his playing days , took to twitter to tell his detractors to `` get stuffed . '' warne 's interviews provoked further discussion on australian television monday when , on the `` today '' show , channel nine presenter david campbell criticized the example he set . `` i hate this , '' he said . `` there is a stadium full of young men and women who look up to these guys , and it would have been nice if one of those cricketers was accountable enough to say ` nothing will be better than what i did on this field , warnie ' . '' `` we ca n't sit around here ... going ` we have a drinking problem ' and then sit there and celebrate that . '' the boozy indiscretions of professional athletes often make the news in australia , although players from the footballing codes of rugby union , rugby league and australian rules are more commonly in the spotlight . members of the successful australian team partied late into the night sunday , with coach darren lehmann tweeting a picture of team members celebrating in their uniforms as the sun came up , with drinks in hand . warne 's inquiries about the team 's plans to celebrate were apparently not in vain . at about 3 a.m. he posted a picture on instagram of himself holding the world cup trophy alongside australian captain michael clarke , the latter with a drink at his side .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the president repeated an unfortunate and ill-fated claim while campaigning hard for obamacare . you remember it . `` if you like your health care plan , you can keep it . '' with that false sloganeering , barack obama made sure he thoroughly owned a piece of the scorn spawned every time an insurance company changed or canceled plans after the aca became law . bad move . he 's apologized , but history will record the affair as his `` read my lips , no new taxes '' moment . yet , there are worse moves politicians can make . republicans are making one now . republican leaders are stepping up to offer woefully inadequate stand-ins for obamacare . they 're offering these salves because they 're hoping the supreme court issues a death blow to the federal exchanges that are now facilitating health coverage in 37 states and they want to have a possible alternative . there is plenty of potential the case , king v. burwell , will succeed in halting the insurance subsidies that federal exchanges require to function . the republican leadership is smart . they understand some of the anxiety already percolating up now could transform into a true panic . but in trying to contain fear , they 're guaranteeing they 'll own the anger that comes next . a collection of three congressmen , including senate finance committee chair orrin hatch -lrb- r-utah -rrb- , recently acknowledged the dire need for an alternative in the wake of obamacare 's demise and issued a `` blueprint '' that nods toward some of the key concepts . rather than subsidize the cost of heavily regulated insurance plans , this proposal would free up the market more , including more price variability , and offer tax credits to help defray the cost for people making up to three times the poverty level . in place of medicaid expansion , the republican plan would cap the federal medicaid support , linking it to the consumer price index . the plan effectively kills universal access by offering people a one-time chance to sign up for coverage , and it does n't require that anyone obtain coverage , making the individual insurance market unsustainable yet again as primarily those who already know they 're in ill health will flood the market and premiums will become unaffordable . if anything , the massive outreach campaigns required to push traffic to healthcare.gov demonstrate the difficulty in getting young , healthy people to act in their own best interests . while this outline potentially salvaged some semblance of the broad health care access the aca is achieving , senator hatch showed his hand with a subsequent washington post op-ed he shared with two other senators . insisting that `` republicans have a plan to help americans harmed by the administration 's actions , '' you might be forgiven if you did n't realize the harm was simply enforcing one 's civic duty to purchase affordable health insurance . instead , hatch and his colleagues hope to soften the blow by offering a transitional period so that marketplace health plans are n't immediately canceled after the supreme court issues its ruling , expected in june . the senators would generously allow states to develop their own plans , something only the intellectual powerhouse of massachusetts managed to accomplish prior to the aca . with most of the affected 37 states having one or more government branches controlled by a party that preferred the status quo prior to the aca , such state-level innovation is n't likely . louisiana governor and distant republican presidential hopeful bobby jindal advocates a starker response : let 's roll out the welcome mat for the apocalypse . he argues that canceling the subsidies in all 50 states would reduce taxes by $ 48 billion , so canceling them in 37 states is a great start . jindal actually thinks the supreme court 's potential decision against the aca presents republicans with an electoral `` solution '' -- the chance to bask in the glory earned by a massive tax cut . the white house got a bit desperate in the run up to obamacare , that much is clear from the poor vetting they applied to president 's own stock stump speeches . beyond his unclear rhetoric , they pushed the law through both chambers of congress hurriedly and did n't allow it to receive the normal careful editing and revisions in a joint committee . the president leaped to sign the bill , warts and all , as it very well could have flitted away altogether . now one of those warts has turned cancerous . it surprised everyone involved with debating and covering the aca at the time of its passage , including the lawyers behind this suit , to learn the bill erroneously specifies only state-run exchanges can dole out subsidies . yet in their giddiness over the law 's potential demise over its own inconsistencies , the republicans are getting sloppy too . the case is driven by a small nonprofit outfit called the competitive enterprise institute , which while it has tentacles throughout the republican establishment , means that the case itself , at one point , could n't be blamed as the gop 's own strategy . but now that multiple republican leaders have stepped up to offer these farfetched fix-it plans , and several leaders have even supplied the court with amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs , there 's simply no separating the gop itself from the supreme court 's decision in king v. burwell . republicans are n't promising that you can keep your plan if you like it . they 're promising , that for millions of americans now receiving their health care through the federal marketplace , you wo n't be able to keep any plan at all . over 9 million people would lose health insurance altogether if the plaintiffs win in king v. burwell , and many more will suffer due to the destabilized markets that in many cases will shut down altogether as rates skyrocket and insurers pull out . none of the republican plans can realistically come together to fill the gap anytime soon , so a gulf will emerge between states with the political will to operate their own exchanges and the red and purple states that do n't have such fortitude . we suffered a rocky transition into the aca , no question , but hospital systems , providers and patients are just now getting the lay of the land . we are seeing some great advantages , particularly in fields like mine . in rehabilitation medicine , we 're seeing that serious injuries that once blocked access to insurance are no longer a barrier . the white house is n't making the mistake of owning what comes next . they 're frank : there are no contingency plans . republicans , apparently , want to own the next wave of insurance cancellations , while refusing to make a simple edit to a bill that for once guaranteed health care for the poor , injured and disabled . so be it -- 2016 is in sight .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- researchers say dr. ben carson may be a brain surgeon , but science shows he 's dead wrong about how sexual orientation works . wednesday on cnn , carson , a retired neurosurgeon and potential republican presidential candidate , said he `` absolutely '' believes being gay is a choice . but scientists say decades of research overwhelmingly shows sexual preference is inborn , not a choice . `` it does n't seem to be the social environment , it does n't seem to be the parents or peers that make you gay , '' said gerulf rieger , a lecturer in the department of psychology at the university of essex in england . `` it seems to be something that comes from within . '' `` sexual orientation is biologically determined , '' added cynthia struckman-johnson , a professor of psychology at the university of south dakota . `` i do n't think any educated person aware of the research would argue differently . '' in a statement wednesday , carson apologized for what he said on cnn , and softened his words , saying the verdict is still out on whether people are born with their sexual preference . `` i do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation , '' he added . while science is seldom definitive about anything , especially something as complicated as why we love who we love , researchers say the preponderance of the evidence shows sexual orientation is not chosen . they point to studies showing children are aware of their sexual orientation at a young age . plus , genetic studies suggest homosexuality runs in families . finally , researchers have found that the very structure of the brain -- specifically , regions of the hypothalamus -- differs in gay and heterosexual men . `` ask a bunch of straight guys -lsb- if they could switch to being gay -rsb- and they would tell you , ` are you kidding me ? '' rieger said . `` so the other way around does n't work either . '' so what was carson 's scientific support for his argument that being gay is a choice ? he pointed to prisons . `` a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out , they 're gay . so , did something happen while they were in there ? ask yourself that question , '' carson told cnn 's chris cuomo . experts on sexual activity in prisons challenged the very premise of carson 's statement , calling it `` preposterous '' and `` appalling . '' `` to , in any way , suggest that a person would go in as a heterosexual and then somehow become a homosexual as a result , that 's simply preposterous . there 's no evidence to support that , '' said robert dumond , a mental health counselor who 's testified to the department of justice about rape in prison . prisoners do engage in homosexual practices , but that does n't mean they 've gone from straight to gay , the experts said . prisoners are often raped , they say , or coerced to engage in sex in exchange for protection from violent prisoners . `` they 're physically forced or forced through blackmail to engage in sex , '' struckman-johnson said . `` to have someone say this is chosen is just showing such great disregard for what we know about the world of sexual assault in prison . '' opinion : prison does n't make people ` come out ' gay . the prisoners who are perpetrating the rape are often either gay to begin with , or are heterosexual and rape to subjugate other prisoners . `` it 's more about power than sex , '' said chris hensley , a criminologist at the university of tennessee who 's done extensive research on sexuality in prison . `` these men do n't see what they 're doing as homosexual , and they will leave their incarceration heterosexual . '' other prisoners do willingly engage in homosexual activity , but the experts say it 's more of a way to release sexual tension and have some degree of intimacy . `` it does n't mean they would choose someone of the same gender in any other situation , '' struckman-johnson said . critics of these studies point out other research they say indicates that orientation is a choice , namely studies that show sexual orientation can change over the course of a lifetime , and that `` socialization '' can alter orientation . overall , the scientists with whom we spoke said they were shocked at carson 's arguments . `` i 'm deeply saddened on multiple levels that someone in the 21st century would take this position , '' dumond said . jen christensen contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a suicide bomb attack in iraq this week was carried out by an american jihadist , isis claims . the terrorist group released a photograph on tuesday of a masked fighter it identified as abu daood al-amriki , an alleged american jihadist who committed the suicide attack . the claim grabbed headlines , but days later , neither cnn nor u.s. government officials have been able to confirm the identity of the attacker . isis claims the attacker used an explosives-laden vehicle to mount an attack in samarra , iraq . two senior iraqi security officials confirmed that an attack matching the description did take place -- that a suicide attacker rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a convoy of iraqi forces . at least three iraqi security forces were killed in the attack , the sources said . but isis has not released the birth name of the alleged american suicide bomber , or shown his face . u.s. officials tell cnn that for the moment there is nothing to corroborate the claim .

boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- bill richard knew his son was n't going to make it . but the father of three told his wife he could n't stay by 8-year-old martin 's side . the boy 's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the boston marathon . his skin had changed color . a crowd hovered over him , frantically trying to help , but he was dying . speaking from the witness stand at dzhokhar tsarnaev 's trial on thursday , richard told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice . `` i knew in my head that i needed to act quickly , or we might not only lose martin , '' he said . `` we might lose jane , too . '' moments after the blast , richard had stumbled toward jane , his 7-year-old daughter . his pants and sneakers were torn apart . his legs felt like they were on fire . he could barely hear . and the air smelled `` vile , '' he said , like gunpowder , sulfur and burned hair . but he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter . `` she tried to get up and she fell . that was when i noticed her leg , '' he said . `` she did n't have it . it was blown off . '' so richard left one son to die near the marathon finish line , and shielded his other son 's eyes from the carnage as they raced to the hospital , hoping that doctors could save his daughter 's life . `` it was , '' richard said thursday , `` the last time i saw my son alive -- barely . '' richard 's description of the explosion 's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high-profile trial . tsarnaev 's attorneys admit that he carried out the 2013 attacks , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the marathon . a fourth person , an mit police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , allegedly ran from police . tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , was killed after a gunbattle with police . and now , his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings . his attorneys say he was influenced by his slain brother to participate in the attacks . they argued thursday that now is n't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions , arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial , when jurors will decide what penalty tsarnaev should face . but the judge sided with prosecutors , who argued the testimony was necessary to support their indictment . on thursday , jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts . defense attorneys did n't ask them any questions . jeff bauman was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line . `` i thought it was weird , '' he said thursday . `` if you are at the airport , if you see any unattended luggage , you notify authorities . '' but this was boston , he thought , where stuff like that does n't happen . still , he told a friend they should move . an explosion came two seconds later . `` i saw a flash , heard like three pops and i was on the ground , '' bauman said from the witness stand thursday . `` at first i opened my eyes and saw the sky . the first thought was , that was a big firework . '' bauman 's ears were ringing , and everything was muffled , but he heard the screams . the first bomb had exploded . `` i looked down and saw my legs , and it was pure carnage , '' he told jurors . `` i could see my bone . '' bauman testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns , wounds on his back , and his legs . `` i knew my legs were gone . i know that instantly , '' he said . he kept repeating to himself , `` this is messed up , this is messed up , this is messed up . '' then the second explosion . `` we are under attack , '' he thought to himself . all he wanted to do was call his mom . when boston police officer lauren woods saw people running by , screaming , she ran against the grain , toward boylston street , the last leg on the marathon route . one of the first victims woods came across was lu lingzi , a graduate student at boston university . lu was vomiting profusely , woods recalled thursday . others were already performing cpr on her , and the officer attempted to clear lu 's airway . `` i smelled the residue of smoke , '' woods said . `` smelled like fireworks , cannons . '' paramedics arrived , and eventually told woods the young woman was not going to make it and they had to move on to other people . lu became one of the three fatalities at the scene . it smelled like gunpowder , alan hern told the jury , and `` kind of felt like we were underwater . '' hern 's wife -- who was pregnant -- was running the race . he found her uninjured , but hysterical from the explosions and ensuing chaos , he said . there were powder marks on her jacket . hern , a high school football coach , then went searching for his 11-year-old son , aaron . a figure covered in black soot and hair standing straight up caught hern 's eye , and he knew it was aaron , he testified . his son 's left thigh was cratered , mangled flesh and blood , hern said . `` it was like something you 'd see in a war movie , '' he said . `` his eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up . '' another of thursday 's witnesses , roseann sdoia , also referred to it as something out of a movie . before she hit the ground from the blast , she said , it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg . `` when i looked down , my leg was tucked under me , but blood was pouring out , '' she told jurors . in front of her lay a socked foot . she started thinking -- did i wear socks today ? she decided she had n't worn socks that day . it was someone else 's foot . `` it was almost like i was starring in a horror movie , '' she said , `` as was everybody else around me . '' doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee . traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital , bill richard went from one terrifying scene to another . `` you know it 's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors ' faces , '' he told the court thursday . `` jane was devastatingly injured . '' doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body , he said . richard soon learned that , as he 'd feared , martin did n't survive the bombing . his wife , denise , was also hospitalized after the attack . she lost sight in one eye . the father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered . the ringing in his ears never stops , and he lost some of his hearing . but richard said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at thursday 's trial . he can still hear music . and the most important thing . `` i can still hear , '' he said , `` the beautiful voices of my family . '' cnn 's ann o'neill reported from boston . mariano castillo and catherine e. shoichet wrote the story in atlanta .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there were three selma to montgomery marches in march 1965 , and rosa parks had missed the first one . parks , whose act of civil disobedience sparked the montgomery bus boycott in 1955 , moved to detroit two years later for safety reasons . death threats , in alabama , were too much for her to endure . for eight years , parks , a working-class woman , toiled at the stockton sewing co. in michigan , making dishrags , for low wages . but on march 1 , 1965 , she abruptly quit to join u.s. rep. john conyers ' staff in detroit . the voting rights movement in the south , led by the rev. martin luther king jr. , coupled with the assassination of malcolm x that february , had re-energized her appetite for direct political action . on sunday , march 7 , parks was at home in detroit watching the abc television premiere of `` judgment at nuremberg '' when the broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a news flash from selma , alabama . a peaceful throng of voting rights activists had marched onto the steel-arched edmund pettus bridge that spanned the alabama river , only to be brutally assaulted by police and alabama state troopers , most of them wearing gas masks . before being arrested and beaten these protesters had been headed to the state capital in montgomery , a distance of 54 miles , to demand federal protection of blacks ' right to vote . that sunday afternoon , 25-year-old john lewis , then chairman of student nonviolent coordinating committee and today a u.s. congressman from georgia 's 5th district , had been tear-gassed and billy clubbed as he tried to cross the bridge . the sight of him being beaten sickened parks . lewis had emerged as the bravest and youngest of the major civil rights leaders of the kennedy-johnson era , even speaking at the march on washington in 1963 . as a freedom rider in the south , he was arrested 24 times , and proud of it . therefore on march 9 , to protest `` bloody sunday , '' as the incident became known , parks walked down detroit 's wide woodward avenue in full solidarity with brother lewis and the others arrested in selma . `` the edmund pettus bridge for me was wrought in symbolism , '' parks recalled years later . `` the photos taken that day made me think of the bridge as a battlefield , like at lexington and concord . it was the start of a turning point . '' so when king -- who had been in atlanta for `` bloody sunday '' -- telegrammed parks about returning to alabama to take part in a third mass march from selma to montgomery , her immediate answer was `` why , of course . '' once back in montgomery in late march at king 's request , parks looked around to see what had changed since the '50s . `` one of the first things i did was look at the buses , '' she told me in 1997 . `` and yes -- they were integrated . ... that felt good . '' on march 25 , parks , the `` mother of the movement , '' spoke eloquently in montgomery though her soft voice was barely audible over the crackling speakers . per usual , king stole the show that day with a rousing piece of oratory . `` we are on the move , '' the nobel peace prize-winning preacher shouted , `` and no wave of racism will stop us ! '' that evening king flew back to atlanta in high spirits , deeming the third selma-to-montgomery march an unqualified success . yet parks , near broke , took a bus back to atlanta the next day , deeply depressed . there was too much white hatred still in montgomery to feel victorious . her great fear was that selma was only a stride forward , in basketball parlance , not a slam-dunk . america was still poisoned by the curse of institutional racism . the fight for voting rights was just beginning . true ballot-box equality was still a long way off . even after president lyndon b. johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 that summer , parks remained somewhat skeptical . she knew southern white bigots would concoct evil new ways to disenfranchise black people . as america reflects on the significance of the 50th anniversary of selma this weekend , it 's important to honor the martyrs of `` bloody sunday '' in a lasting way . certainly , the fact that barack obama , an african-american , is u.s. president proves that lewis did n't get his head dented in vain . but the recent egregious findings of the department of justice following the michael brown case as well as other incidents resulting in the deaths of unarmed men of color still give us reason to pause . `` i remember feeling something was not right , '' parks recalled shortly after the third selma march . `` even though the march was over , i felt that everything was not right . '' one thing `` not right '' on the 50th anniversary of the selma marches is the sad fact that the edmund pettus bridge has n't been renamed the john lewis bridge . continuing to honor pettus -- a confederate general , u.s. senator and white supremacist -- is insulting to america 's civil rights heroes . when the bridge was built in 1940 , jim crow ruled alabama . dallas county blacks had no say in the bridge being named to honor a reconstruction-era white supremacist . thankfully a group of conscientious students has recently started a petition drive to rid the iconic bridge of pettus ' name . but let 's go further than just removing pettus ' name ; let 's rename the bridge for someone who deserves our admiration . i 'm not a historian who thinks confederate memorials should be boarded up . places such as jefferson davis ' beauvoir estate along the mississippi gulf coast and the pedestaled statue of robert e. lee in new orleans -lrb- turning his back to the north -rrb- need historic preservation . but the edmund pettus bridge -- which in 2013 was declared a national historic landmark -- is n't symbolic of the civil war in a meaningful way . it is , however , the modern-day battlefield where the voting rights movement was born . there is no more fitting tribute to the death of jim crow than to rename the `` bloody sunday '' bridge after lewis . i urge president barack obama , the national park service , the state of alabama and the city of selma to `` do the right thing . '' like the statue of liberty , the john lewis bridge would become a sacred place for visitors to reflect on noble american traditions -- in this case , peaceful protest and voting rights . the `` we shall overcome '' year of 1965 would , at last , be given its historical due in selma . `` i 'm with the kids , '' the rev. joseph lowery , a close associate of king 's , recently said in supporting the edmund pettus bridge being redesignated . `` let 's change it . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the suspect behind the knife attack on the american ambassador to south korea had a long , troubled history and often blamed the u.s. for tensions in the korean peninsula . kim ki-jong , 55 , was quickly overpowered and taken into custody after he attacked u.s. ambassador mark lippert with a fruit knife thursday morning . police say kim 's motive for the attack was to improve north-south korean relations and to stop the annual military exercises held jointly by the u.s. and south korea . it was n't the first time kim has taken drastic steps to make his point . -- in 2010 , kim was given a suspended jail sentence for hurling a concrete block at a japanese envoy to south korea , according to the yonhap news agency . that incident is believed to be the first attack on a foreign ambassador in south korea . -- kim allegedly harbored sympathies for north korea , according to korean media reports . yonhap reported that kim had visited north korea six times between 2006 and 2007 , had attempted to erect a memorial for former north korean leader , kim jong-il in seoul , and once set himself on fire in front of the presidential office . -- he was frequently seen at protests , wearing a beret and blaming u.s. policies for straining relations between north and south korea . kim was a member of the korea council for reconciliation and cooperation , which hosted lippert at the thursday event where the attack occurred . the group advocates reunification of the koreas as well as humanitarian aid to north korea . kim was one of its 181 members , but was n't on the list of those invited for the event , according to police . but he was allowed in because an event staff recognized him from the organization . a witness who was sitting next to lippert during the attack said kim was known for having `` unpredictable behavior '' in the organization . even though he appeared somewhat disheveled thursday morning , he was able to enter the event because the staff was familiar with kim , police said . immediately after he allegedly slashed the ambassador in the face and arm , kim was tackled to the floor . as he was transferred to a hospital kim shouted , `` the south korea-u.s. military drills must stop . '' every year , the united states and south korea hold joint military drills , which both countries say are defensive and non-provocative in nature . but the exercises also draw criticism from the north korean regime , which characterize the drills as rehearsals for an attack on the regime . kim also told south korean reporters that he had planned the attack for 10 days , and claimed responsibility for burning a u.s. flag at the embassy in the 1980s . a website associated with kim , displayed a photo of him with protesters holding a sign that read : `` stop war exercises that block north-south korean dialogue . '' the picture was taken at february 24 , in front of the u.s. embassy , according to his website . it also contains a picture of an american soldier inside a red crossed-out circle . on thursday , kim shouted at reporters , saying that the u.s. was to blame for blocking family reunions of north and south koreans who have been separated since the korean war . on the website , he lamented that `` the whole atmosphere of the korean peninsula is freezing up like a frozen soil .

seyne-les-alpes , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a dangerous task as well as a grim one . the rescue workers battling to gather the pulverized pieces of germanwings flight 9525 and the remains of the 150 people on board must contend with high winds as well as treacherous terrain . they climb up a rugged mountain , appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails . bit by bit , bag by bag , high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters , trying to remain stable in the high winds . rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments . winched down from helicopters on to the steep , icy slopes , where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters , workers have had to be tied together in two-person teams . one is there to carry out the investigation and recovery . the second is charged with ensuring their safety as they 're buffeted by the weather . complicating matters , very few of the bodies have been found whole , yves naffrechoux , captain of rescue operations , told cnn on friday . and winds have picked up , making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the french alps in the first place , he said . authorities have deployed 45 alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely , naffrechoux said . his team is based out of seyne-les-alpes , a normally sleepy alpine village that since tuesday 's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation . the leaders of germany , france and spain have visited . the families of the victims have laid flowers and prayed at a nearby memorial . journalists have flocked to the spot as they report the latest developments . meanwhile , the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission . before anything could be recovered , the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped . human remains must be treated with due respect despite the tricky conditions . the workers are now removing more bodies from the site , naffrechoux said . the priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second `` black box , '' the plane 's flight data recorder , he said . investigators hope , once found , it could yield more clues into what happened on the flight deck of the germanwings plane before it slammed into the mountainside at about 430 miles per hour . already , the marseille prosecutor , brice robin , has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that german co-pilot andreas lubitz `` wanted to destroy the aircraft . '' the recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a dna testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units , said naffrechoux . it 's hoped the process will take 10 to 15 days , depending on weather , he said . testimonials posted by france 's interior ministry from rescue and recovery workers at the scene also give an insight into the tough conditions at the remote crash site . cmdr. emmanuel g. , of the criminal research institute from the national gendarmerie , said it was a `` really complicated '' process . `` we are working in two-person teams , whether it 's alongside -lrb- police -rrb- mountain guides , the local gendarmes or the alpine firemen and emergency teams , '' he said . `` we do not know how to continue in this situation otherwise , we really need them to ensure our security at all times .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- angelina jolie 's decision to remove her breasts and ovaries to prevent cancer -lrb- as she detailed in today 's new york times op-ed -rrb- might sound extreme , but breast cancer experts say she was spot on . `` i understand what angelina jolie did , and i would have done it , too , '' said dr. otis brawley , the chief medical officer of the american cancer society . brawley said if he were jolie 's doctor he would have advised her to do what she did because her mother , aunt , and grandmother all had ovarian cancer , and her mother had breast cancer as well . plus , jolie has a gene that gives her about an 87 % chance of getting breast cancer sometime in her life . `` she has one of the particularly bad breast cancer genes , '' brawley said . the decision is made even easier by advances in breast reconstruction and by hormone treatments that help ease women into menopause , which is induced by removing the ovaries . the ovary surgery was a no-brainer , doctors say , and some wondered why she did n't do it sooner . in her op-ed , jolie explained that every year she 's had a blood test called ca-125 , to monitor for ovarian cancer . but that test often has false positives and false negatives , said dr. dr. funmi olopade , director of the center for clinical cancer genetics at the university of chicago . `` you really ca n't rely on it , '' she said . instead of screening , experts in cancer genetics recommend that women at a very high risk for ovarian cancer , like jolie , remove their ovaries as soon as they 're done having children . `` i ca n't emphasize enough how important this is , '' olopade said . olopade was glad to hear tuesday morning that jolie had decided to move forward . `` what she 's done is really important to save her life , because there 's no way to detect ovarian cancer , '' she said . jolie 's decision about her breasts -lrb- also documented in an op-ed -rrb- , however , is not so clear cut , olopade explained , because it would have been perfectly acceptable if jolie had decided to keep her breasts and to get regular mris instead . `` we have lots of survivors who went that route , and they 've done well , '' she said . some made the decision to keep their breasts because they could n't afford a good plastic surgeon for breast reconstruction , she added . `` celebrities have access to that kind of surgery , but that 's not the life everyone lives , '' olopade said . brawley added that jolie 's decision likely would n't be right for someone with a different kind of breast cancer gene mutation . for example , some women have a mutation that gives them a 15 % chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime . that 's not much higher than the 12 % chance a woman has of getting breast cancer even if she has no mutation at all . he says he worries that some of these women with just a slightly increased risk will hear about jolie 's decision and want to remove their breasts , too . `` to get surgery in their situation is really overkill , '' he said . `` most of these women would be just fine if they took tamoxifen for five years and got regular mammograms . '' but all in all , doctors say they 're glad jolie has been so public with her decision making . `` these very publicly shared medical sagas from respected figures play a very powerful role in creating these teachable moments , '' said dr. ken offit , chief of clinical genetics at memorial sloan kettering cancer center . cnn 's john bonifield also contributed .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- two u.k. charities have stopped funding a muslim advocacy group that had earlier helped isis 's masked murderer `` jihadi john , '' now identified as mohammed emwazi , before his radicalization , the group said . the human rights and advocacy group cage in london said it accepted the loss of funding from the roddick foundation and the joseph rowntree charitable trust . but cage blamed a `` neo-conservative '' leadership on the u.k. 's charity commission for pressuring the two charities to halt funding . `` we respect their decision . we thank them for their past support . both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of muslim civil society here in the uk , '' cage spokesperson amandla thomas-johnson said friday . the termination of funding came after the charity commission `` took robust action '' and cited how `` public statements by cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities , '' the commission said in a statement . the commission did n't specify those statements by cage , but stated that `` in our view , those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding cage 's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees , '' the commission said . `` cage is not a charity but has been in part funded by british charities . as it is not a charity and given the nature of its work , and the controversy it has attracted , the charity commission has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity , '' the commission said . `` as the regulator of charities , we expect all charities and trustees to ensure that all charitable funds are used according to their charity 's purposes and in the way that the public would expect , '' the commission said . cage said it had worked with emwazi and indicated that british authorities ' tactics pushed him to radicalize . cage said that emails he sent the organization paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help . emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to cage . emwazi , a kuwaiti-born londoner , was a `` polite '' and `` beautiful young man '' who would drop into the cage office with treats to thank the group for helping him , the group said . emwazi came to cage in 2009 looking for support when he felt that british authorities were -- in the words of asim qureshi , cage 's research director -- `` harassing '' him . but emwazi has now been identified by u.s. officials as the masked man in isis videos showing beheadings of western hostages . more than a dozen british administrative court documents obtained by cnn reveal british security services initially believed emwazi was part of a radical west london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa . the two charities gave sizeable funds to cage . the rowntree charitable trust has given 271,250 british pounds , or almost $ 408,000 , to cage since 2007 , the commission said . the trust had pledged a total of 305,000 pounds , or almost $ 459,000 , the commission said . the roddick foundation gave cage of 120,000 pounds , or more than $ 180,000 between 2009 and 2012 , the commission said . in acknowledging the funding losses , cage criticized the commission . `` this is just another manifestation of their objective of pursuing a cold war on british islam , '' thomas-johnson said . `` cage will remain committed to its principle of speaking truth to power and calling for accountability and transparency . we will not hesitate in performing our role as whistleblowers and as advocates for due process . '' supporters of cage tweeted their criticism of the charity commission and the two philanthropies ' decision to terminate funding . one supporter remarked that `` if @uk_cage is not there to provide us with a counter-narrative when it comes to ` radicalization ' ... . who will ?! '' the commission said it will soon conclude its `` open cases '' into the two charities and publish a report and lessons '' for other charities which fund non-charitable bodies . ''
concord , new hampshire -lrb- cnn -rrb- scott walker brought his midwestern swagger to new hampshire on saturday , leading a crowd of activists to cheers as he sought to draw a contrast to his top-tier rival in the unofficial gop presidential race , jeb bush . the wisconsin governor , amid charges from critics that he 's a flip-flopper , also acknowledged that he had changed positions on immigration reform but argued that he 's remained consistent in everything else . walker was met with great fanfare at his only open event during his two-day stop to the first-in-the-nation primary state . activists gathered at concord high school for a training event that was hosted by the new hampshire gop and headlined by walker 's appearance . jeb bush makes 2016 debut in new hampshire . the contrasts made against bush were subtle , but walker emphasized his modest roots as the son of a preacher and reiterated his penchant for shopping at kohl 's while armed with coupons . `` i actually stopped by kohl 's and bought this sweater in the rack where it 's 70 % off , '' he said , pointing to the sweater he was wearing . `` and we paid one dollar for it with our kohl 's cash ... so , living the high life , '' he added . walker has used his humble beginnings and department-store bona fides in iowa as well , a strategy aimed to cement the fact that he did n't grow up with `` fame and fortune , '' as he frequently says . on saturday , he also put on a cap handed to him by an audience member with the logo for gun owners of new hampshire . `` you 've got a first-rate record on the second amendment ; we hope you 'll wear the hat often and keep up the good work , '' the man said . walker wore it for the rest of his time on stage . -lrb- while he may have donned the cap-and-sweater look saturday afternoon , he was set to sport a tux later that night for his speaking appearance at the gridiron club 's annual white-tie dinner in washington , d.c. president barack obama was also scheduled to speak at the dinner . -rrb- . answering a question from another audience member , walker laid down his staunch opposition to common core , a set of testing standards that bush defended as usual during his visit to new hampshire on friday . walker also stood against re-authorizing the no child left behind act , another topic on which the two republicans disagree . those comments came after walker argued , in an interview with the tampa bay times on friday , that bush would represent a step towards the past , rather than the future . `` we had bob dole , john mccain , mitt romney . if it 's just whoever 's next up , that has n't worked so well for the republican party in the past , '' he said . `` jeb 's a good man . you 're not going to hear me speak ill will of jeb ... i just think voters are going to look at this and say , ` if we 're running against hillary clinton , we 'll need a name from the future -- not a name from the past -- to win . ' '' in his remarks saturday , walker also hit the president over foreign policy and took a shot at hillary clinton for giving `` russia a reset button . '' on domestic policy , he laid out his small-government vision for a system in which success is measured by `` how many people are no longer dependent on the government . '' asked by reporters saturday to respond to flip-flopping accusations by his critics , walker said the `` the only major issue out there was immigration . '' indeed walker reversed his stance earlier this month when he acknowledged that he 's no longer in favor of legislation that would let undocumented immigrants remain in the united states . he said saturday that his change in tune reflected the will of the public . `` this is one where we listened to the people all across the country , particularly border governors who saw how this president messed that up , and that 's an issue where i think people want leaders who are willing to listen to the people on that , '' he said . any other accusations of flip-flopping , he added , `` are just ridiculous . '' critics have argued that walker has been taking a tougher line against abortion in an effort to woo conservatives during the primaries . the governor recently expressed support for a ban on abortion after 20 weeks , after first declining to state his position during his re-election bid in the fall . and critics point to an ad by his campaign in which walker said he supports legislation that leaves `` the final decision to a woman and her doctor . '' walker said saturday he 's remained steady in his views on abortion . `` i 'm pro-life . my position is consistent on that , '' he said . `` they 're taking an ad out there that talked about what the law did in the state -lrb- that -rrb- was endorsed by wisconsin right to life , so it 's a pro-life law . '' he also defended his support for the federal ethanol mandate that helps iowa farmers , despite opposing it in wisconsin in the past . walker 's more private itinerary included meetings with new hampshire business and political leaders , including massachusetts ' former senator , scott brown , who resides in new hampshire and ran unsuccessfully for the u.s. senate seat in the state last year .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a spanish dolphin trainer who was accused on social media of abusing the animals has been found dead , a source with the spanish national police told cnn on saturday . jose luis barbero was expected to become vice president of the georgia aquarium in atlanta , cnn affiliate wsb reported . he was found dead inside his vehicle in the public parking lot of the palma de mallorca airport on the island of mallorca , the source said . the source said the case is being treated as a suicide . georgia aquarium chairman and ceo mike leven issued a strongly worded statement that said : . `` georgia aquarium began a search for truth in hopes of disproving these unsubstantiated claims . sadly , -lrb- barbero -rrb- and his family received death threats , and groups and individuals rushed to judge him . he was not given the right or the privilege to be considered innocent until proven guilty ... his death is untimely , unnecessary and unjust .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- gunmen killed 19 people and sent tourists scrambling for cover in a siege at a museum in tunisia 's capital on wednesday . the north african nation 's prime minister called it a cowardly terrorist attack and warned that three suspects were still on the loose . tunisian security forces killed two attackers as they ended the hostage siege at the bardo museum in tunis , prime minister habib essid said . but the death toll , which included 17 tourists and at least one tunisian security officer , could climb . polish , italian , german and spanish tourists were among those killed , essid said , with another 20 foreign tourists and two tunisians wounded in the attack . `` it 's a cowardly attack mainly targeting the economy of tunisia , '' the prime minister said . `` we should unite to defend our country . '' the scene played out at a popular tourist destination in the heart of tunisia 's capital in a building linked to where the nation 's parliament meets . lawmakers there were in the middle of a committee meeting when they heard gunfire erupt . `` the tourists were frightened and they were running in different directions . we opened the doors and we got them to enter to the parliament , '' lawmaker mehrezia labidi told cnn 's christiane amanpour . an administrator told lawmakers to lay down on the ground as a gunbattle broke out between terrorists and police , said sabrine ghoubatini , a member of parliament . it was n't long before the building was evacuated . photos on twitter showed security forces in bulletproof vests and black helmets and masks , guns drawn , in the area . authorities set up a large security cordon around the targeted museum . rescuers carried wounded tourists away on stretchers . essid did n't specify where the attackers came from . interior ministry spokesman mohamed ali aroui called them islamists in remarks on national radio . the museum , housed in a 19th century palace , bills itself as `` a jewel of tunisian heritage . '' its exhibits showcase tunisian art , culture and history , and it boasts a collection of mosaics , including one of the poet virgil , as well as marble sculptures , furniture , jewels and other items . no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack . but it happened just days after a tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group . in his message , the jihadi claimed to belong to jund al-khilafah in tunisia , a group that in december pledged allegiance to isis , even though that vow did n't seem to have fully registered with the islamist extremist group . his post comes after an isis fighter in raqqa , syria , recently appeared in a video questioning why jihadis in tunisia had not pledged fealty . `` this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be isis ' debut on the tunisian stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from tunisian jihadis for maximum impact , '' cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said . tunisia has seen far less militant violence than other nations in the region that were part of the arab spring uprisings , like neighboring libya . but it has n't been immune to it . the government has been battling a jihadist presence in the chaambi mountains . there have been several apparent political assassinations . and in february , the country 's interior ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . up to 3,000 tunisians are believed to have traveled to iraq and syria to fight as jihadists , more than any other country , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london . `` there are hundreds that have returned from the battlefield , yet we have n't seen this kind of activity in tunisia yet , '' said rick francona , a former u.s. air force intelligence officer and cnn military analyst . `` i think it was only a matter of time . and today was the day . '' tunisia is where the arab spring took root in december 2010 , when a poor , 26-year-old man set himself on fire in front of a tunisian government building after police confiscated his vegetable cart , sparking protests there . protests throughout the middle east and north africa soon followed , with revolutions toppling governments in some countries . while violence and instability have continued to shake egypt , libya and syria , in many ways , tunisia has been the exception , with the economist going so far as to name it `` country of the year '' for 2014 . `` the idealism engendered by the arab spring has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism , with a shining exception : tunisia , '' the magazine wrote . '' ... its economy is struggling and its polity is fragile ; but tunisia 's pragmatism and moderation have nurtured hope in a wretched region and a troubled world . '' while it has been more peaceful than other countries , tunisia has seen its share of violence and political turmoil . there was cautious optimism after the october 2011 elections -- the country 's first since its independence in 1956 -- that involved 60 political parties and thousands of independent candidates vying for seats in the country 's new constitutional assembly . the next two years saw some crackdowns on media freedom , as well as criticisms of efforts to criminalize blasphemy and inject strict religious discourse in mosques . in 2013 , two opposition leaders were assassinated . but analysts say wednesday 's attack could have been carried out by people who care more about fomenting terror or establishing a strict islamic caliphate -- isis ' aim -- than tunisian politics . the country has also been batting socioeconomic problems such as youth unemployment . young people who ca n't get jobs are finding that joining extremist groups like isis and al qaeda is a way out . up until now , these recruits have largely done their fighting away from home . experts think that by taking the fight to tunisia , they 'll hurt their cause not just by hurting the tourism-reliant economy , but also by alienating most of their countrymen . `` they 're already isolated and marginalized , and they further isolate and marginalize themselves by these actions , '' said mubin shaikh , a former undercover counterterrorism operative . '' ... this will just further isolate and alienate these groups from the rest of the public . '' travelers warned of risks as tunisia reels from attack . cnn 's samira said , ashley fantz , alanne orjoux , gul tuysuz , sandrine amiel , antonia mortensen , laura perez maestro , vasco cotovio , as well as journalists shokri shihi , barbie latza nadeau and livia borghese , contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for years , they 've wanted six seasons and a movie , and at 3:01 a.m. et tuesday , fans got it ... almost . there 's no movie yet , but `` community 's '' much-awaited sixth season made its debut . not even cancellation by nbc could kill the fan favorite sitcom , as yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early tuesday . the show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to yahoo , though cast member yvette nicole brown -lrb- now on cbs ' `` the odd couple '' -rrb- had to leave the show for family reasons . the premiere briefly touches on this in its own way , with shirley 's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff -lrb- as the character abed points out , along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode -rrb- . the `` new shirley , '' as dean joked , is paget brewster 's frankie , who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group . soon , the group was running a prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with frankie . and how about the end of the first episode , which gave us a look at the spinoff , `` the butcher and the baker , '' with shirley and steven weber as a southern lawyer ? episode two got even more out there , with dean pelton 's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving britta 's parents . most interesting was the introduction of keith david as '90s tech genius elroy . critics praised the show , with the hollywood reporter 's amy amatangelo saying , `` everything fans loved about community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references -lrb- portuguese gremlins , anyone ? -rrb- and meta commentary . the show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue .

selma , alabama -lrb- cnn -rrb- in a passionate speech about racial progress in america , president barack obama on saturday told thousands of people who gathered here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of `` bloody sunday '' that `` our march is not yet finished . but we are getting closer . '' obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were brutally beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights . `` if selma taught us anything , it 's that our work is never done , '' the president said near edmund pettus bridge , where the confrontation between authorities and marchers was captured in film and photographs that jolted the nation . read president obama 's prepared remarks . the president said that what civil rights marchers did years ago `` will reverberate through the ages . not because the change they won was preordained ; not because their victory was complete ; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible ; that love and hope can conquer hate . '' he hailed the marchers as heroes . the president said that `` the americans who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing , but they gave courage to millions . they held no elected office . but they led a nation . '' the `` bloody sunday '' anniversary marks 50 years from the day hundreds of people were brutally attacked by alabama state troopers as they marched from selma to montgomery , alabama , to protest racial discrimination in voter registration . about 600 people participated in the planned 50-mile journey on march 7 , 1965 . the marchers were protesting discrimination that kept black people from voting . but as the marchers approached the foot of the bridge , state troopers used force and tear gas to push them back . as events were underway saturday in selma , hundreds of people marched across the brooklyn bridge in new york to symbolize their unity with the alabama commemoration . television coverage of the event in 1965 triggered national outrage and eventually led congress to pass the landmark voting rights act of 1965 , which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination . 50 years later : memories from ` bloody sunday ' nurse . many of the nation 's leaders , activists and celebrities were in selma on saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event . on saturday , rep. john lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of congress from both parties joined the president at the bridge in selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of pettus , a confederate general who was also a ku klux klan leader . `` we must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work . there 's still work to be done , '' said lewis , adding this is an opportunity to `` redeem the soul of america . '' the president said that though progress has been made , racism is still too prevalent in america . `` we just need to open our eyes , and ears , and hearts , to know that this nation 's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us , '' he said . `` we know the march is not yet over , the race is not yet won , and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character -- requires admitting as much . '' the president called on congress to restore the voting rights act , first passed in 1965 . in 2013 , the u.s. supreme court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to `` pre-clear '' any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them . efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in congress . john lewis 's memories of the march . reflecting a sense of change in the half century since bloody sunday , and with selma again in a national media spotlight , the mood in the crowd saturday was of unity , and talks were focused on how to move america forward . but some current selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82 % black and with more than 40 % of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance . many black residents of selma say they still live in a divisive society and still feel the sting of racism , with true change yet to come . geraldine martin , 59 , has lived in selma all her life . she was 9 years old on `` bloody sunday '' and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister , belinda , to the world on that day . the two sisters grew up in selma less than a decade apart . they graduated from selma high school and both had to make decisions about whether to stay in their hometown when few opportunities existed for young people . `` we need to reevaluate our education system , '' said geraldine , who became a special education teacher at selma high . `` we need incentives for young people . i am hoping today 's events will help us move forward . '' opinion : selma 's historic bridge deserves a better name . belinda shook her head . she left selma after high school and now lives in atlanta . her view of selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside . `` i do n't see how selma will move forward without togetherness , '' said belinda . `` there is no diversity in selma . people do n't live together . `` i want to ask white people : ` so why are you so angry at us ? is it really the color of my skin or something deeper ? ' '' maybe , she said , the attention on selma this weekend will help spark a relevant dialogue . 50 years later : the house where mlk stayed . cnn 's moni basu reported from selma . cnn 's slma shelbayah wrote and reported from atlanta . cnn 's steve almasy and douglas brinkley contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy , regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation . rainbow gatherings -- annual events that take place throughout the world -- encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement . photographer matjaz krivic 's `` somewhere under the rainbow '' series was shot over 19 years at rainbow gatherings in various countries . according to krivic , the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient hopi native american prophecy about `` rainbow warriors . '' rainbow gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals -- peace , harmony , freedom and respect . those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a `` rainbow family . '' the community , which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages , comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society 's popular culture of consumerism , materialism and mass media . those who attend are not required to pay any form of money , not even for food , and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader . instead , rainbow gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community 's beliefs in a more equitable society and its people 's love and tolerance for one another . `` the magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want , '' krivic said . '' -lrb- but -rrb- nobody needs to pay for the food . everybody is welcome to go and eat there . '' krivic says that rainbow gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that `` need to be healed '' after having experienced devastating conflicts . past gatherings include those held in serbia , bosnia and ukraine . `` i really do n't like what 's going on in this world . ... there 's just so much stuff happening , '' krivic said . `` you can always go to -lrb- rainbow gatherings -rrb- and stay there and have a nice time , and you do n't even have to pay for it . it will be a nice time , nice energy , not aggressive . '' one of the most enjoyable aspects about rainbow gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available , where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques . another significant part of rainbow gatherings is the all-encompassing sound . `` i like the music , i 'm an audiophile . i like all sorts of music , but when i go there it 's live , it 's there , '' krivic said . `` it 's like two guys playing and eventually it 's like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful . '' the first rainbow gathering took place in colorado in 1972 , and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture `` tribes '' from northern california and the pacific northwest . since then , the gatherings have extended to other areas in the united states as well as a number of different countries . the international gatherings generally take place during the summer , before august 's full moon . according to krivic , the exact locations of some of the rainbow gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at rainbow gatherings , and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography . ever since his first rainbow gathering , krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses . `` the gatherings did n't change , '' krivic said , `` but my photography did change -- a lot . ... i consider photography differently now . '' krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital , which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings . he also had to carefully decide who to photograph . `` i had some friends and i could take photos of them , and then eventually when i was going on and on , it just became like a family , '' he said . `` it 's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year . '' just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way , `` somewhere under the rainbow '' enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos , leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations . in one photo , krivic takes viewers to pakistan in 1998 , where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands . it 's then 2003 in france . light rays power through colossal trees , illuminating tents and tepees and dosing the atmosphere with warmth . viewers later discover a delicate morning hug between a man and woman at last year 's rainbow gathering in hungary , with a sunflower softly blooming out of a ukulele . as for krivic , he feels that `` somewhere under the rainbow '' is not finished and will never be . `` i will never complete it . i will always go because i like it , '' he said . `` i will take photos again of friends , and just go on with it .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- what 's better than the sun on a march day in europe , at the tail end of winter with spring on the doorstep ? no sun , apparently . that was the verdict of many around the continent , who found friday morning 's solar eclipse picture perfect . millions from around north africa , the middle east as well as europe woke up with a chance to see the rare cosmic event . for some of them , it was a partial eclipse ; but others -- say if you were at the north pole , or in svalbard or the faroe islands between iceland and norway -- got the full deal . such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself , happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the earth and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger . an eclipse happens when the moon passes right in front of the sun , blocking the sunlight and casting a shadow on the earth . that means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again , until the sun and moon get out of each other 's way . staring at the sun anytime can be a bit dangerous , even when it 's there , not there , then there again during an eclipse . that 's where the term `` eclipse blindness '' -- which is really retinal burns -- comes from . luckily , a lot of those peering into the skies friday came prepared . at least that was the case for famous bayern munich footballers xabi alonso and pepe reina , who looked cool looking up in their 3-d movie-type glasses . or a bunch of children at stockport grammar , a british school not far from manchester . one of them looked more like a welder than a stargazer but did n't seem to mind , giving a thumbs-up to the view . not everyone was similarly enthused ; not because they do n't love a good eclipse , but because they do n't like a bad one . cnn 's nick thompson in london , for instance , went out hoping for an out-of-this-world experience and instead saw little more than a bunch of clouds . he was n't alone , as many in britain in particular did n't get the big show they 'd hoped for . clouds be damned , some folks there used a sun costume , along with an earth-and-moon prop , to put on a show of their own . if the sun wo n't come out for you , then you might as well be the sun , their reasoning went . even in the united kingdom , whether you were glasgow university students cheering when a glimpse of the eclipse emerged from the clouds or a bird soaring the sky , there was a lot of enthusiasm for the eclipse . and there were even more cheers elsewhere , in berlin , beirut and beyond . norwegians , especially , got some of the most spectacular perspectives . eclipses are n't everyday events , and they 're getting less common . while there will be more full eclipses , they will get rarer and rarer as the moon moves away from the earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters -lrb- about 1.5 inches -rrb- every year . that means there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun . but do n't sweat it just yet : nasa calculates this will take about 563 million years , meaning there 's still time to catch another eclipse . weather permitting , of course . cnn 's dave gilbert contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the tragic news that germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the french alps by a pilot deemed `` 100 % fit to fly '' challenges the common understanding of the phrase . marseille prosecutor brice robin said co-pilot andreas lubitz apparently `` wanted to destroy the aircraft , '' taking advantage of the pilot leaving the cockpit and most likely refusing to open the cabin door after activating the plane 's descent . the ceo of lufthansa -- of which germanwings is a subsidiary -- said lubitz had been `` fit to fly . '' but for most of us , the prosecutor 's preliminary finding that the 28-year-old german purposefully caused the deaths of 150 people on march 24 puts him squarely outside that term . in fact `` fit to fly '' does not mean the pilot 's psychological state has necessarily been assessed . simon mitchell is a pilot and visiting fellow at cranfield university 's safety and accident investigation centre in southern england . over the last few years the aviation industry has been considering the amount of time spent examining pilots ' skills compared to the time spent examining how they thought , mitchell said . many organizations had begun assessing the safety of particular airlines when considering which carriers their members should fly on , he said . `` it 's not uncommon for those corporations to have in their assessment matrix a look at pilot selection procedures , '' mitchell said . `` increasingly we 're looking at their all-round personalities and ability to work in teams and what they 're like as people . `` apart from ` do we want to ensure we have n't recruited somebody who might have some sort of mental disorder , ' there 's also a very good reason in a day-to-day way . you want to recruit somebody who works well in a team , '' he said . `` the airline industry is quite unique in the amount of trust and liability it places in the hands of a very small number of employees , '' mitchell said . `` if you look at the value of the aircraft and the immeasurable value of the lives being flown in that aircraft , you come up to a huge number -- in the hundreds of millions , if not billions -- of dollars of risk associated with that asset . in effect , a medium to large sized company is being placed in the hands of a few employees . `` it is important that these airlines take a great deal of care -- not just about whether that pilot can fly -- but how fit that person is to carry that sort of responsibility . '' on thursday , lufthansa ceo carsten spohr said the company 's pilots did not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they were flying . but he said lufthansa did consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots . `` we do n't only look at competence , but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , '' spohr said . the pilot and co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525 had passed the test the airline used to evaluate applicants , he said . but mitchell said aviation regulations only required a physical and not a psychiatric medical examination , looking at a potential pilot 's fitness to fly in terms of factors such as heart attack risk . those being examined were legally required to declare any mental disorder , but there was no standard psych testing from a regulatory point of view , he said , with airlines and industry bodies failing to reach consensus on types of tests to be used . `` the doctor is supposed to note any evident issues that he notices -- but what is he going to notice in half an hour 's medical ? the rest of it relies on your medical history and you being honest , '' mitchell said . the federal aviation administration told cnn that u.s. scheduled airline pilots must renew medical certificates every year if they 're less than 40 years old and every six months if older . `` pilots must complete an official faa medical application form , and have a physical examination conducted by an faa-designated aviation medical examiner , '' it said . `` the faa medical application form includes questions pertaining to the mental health of the pilot . the ame can defer a pilot to the faa office of aerospace medicine if he or she believes that additional psychological testing is indicated . all existing physical and psychological conditions and medications must be disclosed . '' on its website , the faa guidance for ames states : `` the faa does not expect the examiner to perform a formal psychiatric examination . however , the examiner should form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant . '' in terms of a pilot 's fitness to fly on a particular day , mitchell said attempts by many companies and airlines to introduce random drug and alcohol testing had hit problems with unions . `` when crew report for duty , they obviously are seen by other company personnel and they 're also supposed to stop someone who 's not fit for duty , '' he said , adding that was not a particularly robust system . `` it does rely on a professional crew member turning around and stopping the flight . '' in the short term , the industry needed to be sensitive to the fact that the crash was `` an incredibly tragic event , '' mitchell said . `` we need to be conscious in short-term not to exacerbate stress of the families in the first days , '' he said . `` it is important as an industry to recognize the amount of trust that 's been put in our hands and ensure the system is robust enough to live up to that . '' but managing an industry with global implications was complex , mitchell said , pointing out that lubitz was able to lock out the other pilot because of strengthened security measures introduced after the september 11 hijackings . `` it 's horribly , tragically , ironic that an unintended consequence of trying to mitigate one risk has actually facilitated an equally horrendous act -- that would n't have been possible if we had n't done something to try to mitigate the other risk . '' was 9/11 safety precaution a flaw ? john newsome and laura smith-spark contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- what does it take to help a single dolphin entangled in fishing line ? in the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of florida , about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations . and that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention . with spring approaching , marine experts say it 's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water . from plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots , marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris . with limited time and resources , experts ca n't save them all . `` you really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff , '' said elizabeth stratton , national oceanic and atmospheric administration fisheries ' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region . `` we feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal 's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans , '' said stratton , who was involved in last week 's rescue . so where does an intervention begin ? a couple spotted the calf off the coast of fort pierce with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum , or snout . the mammal was riding the wake of their boat . they reported it january 18 to the harbor branch oceanographic institution , which set out to find the calf and his mother . the group found the pair and took more pictures , which were sent to the noaa fisheries on february 9 for evaluation . the photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf 's upper jaw , cutting into the tissue to the bone , threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection . veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life-threatening . `` we ca n't disentangle every animal , '' stratton said , `` but if it comes back as life-threatening , we mobilize to do disentanglement . '' the next step was to find the creatures again . through characteristics on the mother 's dorsal fin , the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search . after a two-day search , the group found the dolphins on friday and approached for intervention . the process took about an hour , from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way , stratton said . apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition . rescuers gave the calf a long-lasting antibiotic and radio-tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean `` where they belong , '' stratton said . the moral of the story for humans : `` be conscious of your gear .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- if death is the big sleep , as it is sometimes called , is there anything wrong with a dying person choosing a medically induced smaller sleep -- deep sedation -- to avoid the pain of a terminal illness ? is it ok for a patient to choose to spend his or her final days on this mortal coil in what would amount to a medically induced coma ? or is it simply euthanasia in disguise ? members of the french parliament offered resounding support tuesday for the proposition that is should be permissible for doctors to induce sleep until death in terminally ill patients who are in pain . they approved a bill allowing that by a vote of 436-34 . there were , however , 83 lawmakers who declined to vote -- a measure of just how contentious the issue has been . the bill goes now to the french senate . should it become law , doctors would be allowed to administer `` deep sedation until death '' to terminally ill patients who request it , and for whom palliative care would not ease the pain . the law would also allow doctors who have stopped life-saving measures to administer deep sedation , if they deem it appropriate , to terminally ill patients who are unable to give their consent . `` everyone has the right to a death that is dignified and soothed , '' the proposed law says . and health professionals , it continues , should `` implement all the means at their disposal to fulfill this right . '' what the law entails , according to jean leonetti , the member of parliament who proposed it , is simple : `` sleep before death to avoid suffering . '' what it also entails is legal protection for doctors who , in fact , already sedate some dying patients , and who are sometimes taken to court by relatives as a result . euthanasia is illegal in france , though president francois hollande promised in his 2012 campaign that he would reopen the issue . polls show that more than 90 % of french people support the proposal -- an astonishing majority for any proposal -- and hollande has said it would represent a big step forward . but , as might be predicted , the proposed law has proved divisive in the extreme . some lawmakers on the left of the political spectrum said in advance they would abstain from tuesday 's vote because they thought the bill did not go far enough toward legalizing euthanasia . and some on the right said they , too , would abstain , because they saw the law is a way of legalizing euthanasia in disguise . cnn 's jim bittermann in paris contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- it recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history , but for critics on social media , one comic book cover went too far , and it 's now been pulled . dc comics pulled the cover for the upcoming `` batgirl '' # 41 , which portrays the joker threatening a frightened batgirl with a gun , with `` joker makeup '' on her mouth . the twitter hashtag #changethecover had been trending since friday , when the cover was revealed . it 's a variant , aka an optional cover , which tends to grab the attention of collectors but wo n't be the main cover seen in most stores . for the month of june , dc 's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain . the cover recalls barbara `` batgirl '' gordon 's encounter with the joker in the classic story `` the killing joke . '' in it , he brutally attacked barbara , kidnapping her , and it was heavily implied that she was sexually assaulted . after being shot , the character remained in a wheelchair for decades , until dc retconned barbara 's fate in 2011 , allowing her to walk again and be batgirl . the criticism of the cover spread over a few days , though others defended it with their own hashtags . dc comics -lrb- owned by time warner , which also owns cnn -rrb- said in a statement late monday that artist rafael albuquerque 's cover was going to be pulled . `` regardless if fans like rafael albuquerque 's homage to alan moore 's the killing joke graphic novel from 25 years ago , or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society , '' they said . `` we stand by our creative talent , and per rafael 's request , dc comics will not publish the batgirl variant . '' albuquerque said in his own statement , `` my batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that i really admire , and i know is a favorite of many readers . ` the killing joke ' is part of batgirl 's canon and artistically , i could n't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between barbara gordon and the joker . '' he continued , `` for me , it was just a creepy cover that brought up something from the character 's past that i was able to interpret artistically . but it has become clear , that for others , it touched a very important nerve . i respect these opinions and , despite whether the discussion is right or wrong , no opinion should be discredited . he concluded , `` my intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art . for that reason , i have recommended to dc that the variant cover be pulled . i 'm incredibly pleased that dc comics is listening to my concerns and will not be publishing the cover art in june as previously announced . '' albuquerque added in a tweet on monday night that he was never threatened -lrb- the `` threats '' dc referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover , per `` batgirl '' writer cameron stewart -rrb- . stewart tweeted more : `` i stand behind rafael as an artist and a friend , and think he made the right decision . the cover was not seen or approved by anyone on team batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic . so , we have the creators of the book and the artist himself all agreeing that the cover was inappropriate . there 's no ` censorship ' here . '' that did n't stop the controversy on social media . it was just the latest brouhaha involving portrayals of women in comic books and variant covers in particular . in september , marvel comics canceled future variant covers from artist milo manara after a `` spider-woman '' no. 1 variant cover caused an uproar for being `` over-sexualized . '' -lrb- the company later said there was no connection between the two events . -rrb- .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- marvel is going back to war . the massively popular superhero entertainment factory has the third `` captain america '' movie on the way , `` civil war , '' which will include iron man and quite possibly , the new spider-man . it 's based on a story arc from almost a decade ago , which tackled issues of freedom versus security , with the two heroes going toe to toe against one another . this summer , marvel plans to revisit that storyline as part of the much larger return of `` secret wars , '' its biggest crossover event of the 1980s . the effects of this will be huge to the comics , ending 33 of the company 's titles . cnn spoke to writer charles soule , who has gained acclaim for his work on `` superman/wonder woman , '' `` swamp thing , '' the death of wolverine , '' `` she-hulk '' and more . he gave us the scoop on the return of `` civil war , '' one year before it hits the big screen . cnn : what can fans expect from your `` civil war '' storyline ? soule : `` secret wars '' is an opportunity to revisit some of the great marvel stories of the past . one of those is `` civil war , '' and i got the call to work on that . `` civil war '' happened in 2006 and 2007 , and in that story captain america and iron man went after each other based on an ideological difference on superheroes in the world . what i 'm doing is taking that story in a different direction . cnn : will this be a way for those who are interested in the upcoming movie to dive into that story ? soule : absolutely . if you look at the ideas that that story had , iron man thought superheroes should have to register with the government , and become something of a police force . captain america thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country . it was a debate of security versus freedom . we 're taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas . the registration act is all in the past at this point . it 's more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war , and it 's a huge story and it 's fun to be able to involve every marvel character there is . cnn : is this one of the biggest stories you 've worked on ? soule : i 've been on big books but this one feels huge . it affects every character in one way or another , and it deals with some central issues to the modern world . that 's not always something you get to do in a marvel story . cnn : so this will have many twists and turns away from the original story ? soule : the idea is to take some of the events in the original storyline and spin them off into entirely new stories . without spoiling , this deals with a world that has been ravaged for quite some time when we pick up the story . i felt the original `` civil war '' explored those questions very well . if i was going to play in this sandbox , i wanted to ask my own questions .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- embattled ferguson police chief thomas jackson resigned wednesday , a week after a scathing justice department report slammed his department . jackson and the city `` have agreed to a mutual separation , '' ferguson officials announced . `` it 's a really hard pill to swallow , '' jackson said in a text message responding to cnn 's request for comment . he also confirmed his resignation in a letter to ferguson 's mayor . `` it is with profound sadness that i am announcing i am stepping down from my position as chief of police for the city of ferguson , missouri , '' jackson said , adding that serving the city as police chief `` has been an honor and a privilege . '' the resignation will go into effect march 19 , jackson said , to `` provide for an orderly transition of command . '' `` i will continue to assist the city in any way i can in my capacity as private citizen , '' jackson wrote . but even though he 's about to be out of a job , jackson will still collect a paycheck . jackson will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year , the city said , with lt. col. al eickhoff assuming his duties during a nationwide search for a new chief . ferguson mayor james knowles said he could n't go into details about the personnel discussions behind the decision to give jackson a year of severance pay . `` i think it 's fair to say that in many executive level private industries , you would get a similar treatment , '' he said . knowles said the police chief decided to resign `` after a lot of soul searching . '' `` i think it 's important that we recognize that the chief made this decision because he wanted to do this , '' knowles said . `` he thought it was the best for the city and the police department . '' hours after the announcement , protesters gathered outside the ferguson police department . `` fight back , '' many chanted as they faced a long line of police officers . at least two people were arrested , cnn affiliate kmov said , but it was not immediately clear why . as of late wednesday night , the protest was largely peaceful . jackson 's resignation is the latest fallout from the justice department report , which exposed problems in the city 's policing tactics and faulted ferguson 's officers for seeing residents as `` sources of revenue , '' a practice that federal investigators said disproportionately targeted african-americans . the investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by ferguson police and court officials . ferguson city manager john shaw stepped down tuesday . the report mentions both men by name . two police officers resigned last week and the city 's top court clerk was fired in connection with racist emails , city spokesman jeff small said on friday . last week , jackson declined to comment on details in the report . `` i need to have time to really analyze this report so i can comment on it , '' jackson told cnn thursday . when asked what he planned to do about the report 's findings , the chief said he would `` take action as necessary . '' after his resignation wednesday , he said in a written statement to cnn 's don lemon that he was encouraged by the report 's conclusion , which says that ferguson `` has the capacity to reform its approach to law enforcement . '' `` we agree that ferguson can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be , '' he said . knowles told reporters wednesday that the city is still analyzing the report . `` we continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was , '' he said . `` the chief , being an honorable man , decided we needed to talk about the way moving forward was with someone else . he left . '' city officials , he said , still believe the police department can be reformed without being eliminated . `` the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity , '' the mayor said . `` we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness . '' when jackson became ferguson 's police chief in 2010 , it was supposed to be a relatively easy way to cap his career in law enforcement . after some 30 years with the st. louis county police department , serving as commander of a drug task force and swat team supervisor , being a police chief of a smaller department should have been less stressful . the shooting of michael brown last year changed everything . brown , an african-american teen , was unarmed when he was shot by a white ferguson police officer . the incident exposed feelings of distrust between ferguson 's black community and its police department , which is overwhelmingly white . darren wilson , the officer who shot brown , wo n't face any criminal charges for the shooting . in november , a grand jury decided not to indict him . last week the justice department said wilson 's actions `` do not constitute prosecutable violations '' of federal civil rights law . he resigned from the department in november , citing security concerns . but that has n't stopped criticism of the department from local residents and top federal officials . even before the justice department report was finished , u.s. attorney general eric holder said it was `` pretty clear that the need for wholesale change in that department is appropriate . '' critics have accused jackson of inflaming tensions in the st. louis suburb with his response to the shooting . over the past six months , jackson has defended his officers and vowed to work with the community . `` i intend to see this thing through . and i 've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems , '' he told cnn in november . cnn 's jason carroll contributed to this report .
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- it does n't matter how many times israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the palestinians . the white house is refusing to take him at his word . `` we take him at his word when he said that it would n't happen during his prime ministership , and so that 's why we 've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we do n't see a chaotic situation in the region , '' president barack obama said in an interview with the huffington post published saturday . these are the president 's first public comments since netanyahu 's party captured the most seats in tuesday 's parliamentary election . netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in palestinian statehood , despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes . only on thursday , two days after the election , did president obama congratulate netanyahu by phone on his victory . white house press secretary josh earnest declined to say whether netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call . but obama told the prime minister that the united states would `` reassess '' aspects of its relationship with israel after netanyahu 's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a palestinian state . administration officials have said the united states is now considering signing on to a u.n. resolution which supports a palestinian state . regarding comments netanyahu made tuesday about arab israeli voters going to the polls `` in droves '' -- comments described by some as racist -- obama told the huffington post that that kind of `` rhetoric '' was `` contrary to what is best of israel 's traditions . that although israel was founded based on the historic jewish homeland and the need to have a jewish homeland , israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly . '' obama added : `` if that is lost , then i think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who do n't believe in a jewish state , but it also i think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country . '' u.s. house speaker john boehner , who invited netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of congress earlier this month , plans to visit israel at the end of the month . while the speaker 's office says the trip was planned well before the prime minister 's re-election , it will come around the deadline for an initial nuclear deal between iran , the united states and other world powers .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- at least a dozen tourists on two cruises that visited the tunisian capital , tunis , are among more than 20 people who were gunned down this week at the country 's bardo national museum , officials said . details of the victims in wednesday 's attack have been slow to emerge . some of the bodies remained unidentified at a morgue , a forensic official said friday . here 's what is known so far : . among the first victims to be named was briton sally adey . the uk foreign office confirmed her identity . she was a 57-year-old retired solicitor who was on a dream vacation with her husband , robert , britain 's telegraph newspaper reported . the couple were married in 1984 and have two children -- molly , a 20-year-old university student , and harry , a 23-year-old musician , the newspaper said . julia holden , a close friend of the adeys , gave a statement to cnn that said , `` sally adey was a much loved daughter , wife and mother . the family are devastated by her loss . they are also saddened for others who have lost people they love , and for those who have been hurt . '' foreign secretary philip hammond said consular staff were helping adey 's family . `` the extremists , the terrorists , they hate democracy , '' uk prime minister david cameron said . `` they hate the idea that people should be able to choose their own government . but we must not let democracy , freedom , the rule of law , the things that we hold dear and people in tunisia hold dear -- we must not let them be defeated or undermined by these extremists and terrorists . `` that is the battle we are engaged in , but i 'm confident , if we stick to our values , we will win through . '' two more victims were named as spanish couple antoni cirera perez and dolores sanchez rami . they were on a cruise that stopped in tunis . francisco cabezas , a sportswriter with the newspaper el mundo , wrote that his neighbors for eight years had loved children and walking in the mountains . perez loved formula 1 races . the sportswriter wrote that he recently invited the couple over to meet his baby daughter , adria . they were ecstatic to hear the cries of a baby , he said . perez instructed him softly , `` let her cry , that is what she has to do . '' president francois hollande , who said he stood firm with tunisia , confirmed that three french citizens were killed and seven others wounded . he told reporters at an eu council meeting in brussels , belgium , that two of the wounded were in serious condition . the five who are slightly hurt are expected to return shortly to france . bruno masarotto , a spokesman for the town hall of aussillon , in southern france , confirmed that jean-claude tissier , a former municipal councilor for aussillon , was one of the french citizens killed . tissier , 71 , was a hairdresser and had two sons , one of whom is deceased , he said . fellow hairdresser serge fournes said he and tissier were part of the same theater group . he said it was a `` paradox '' that his friend , who was passionate about art , should die in a museum . fournes said tissier lived with his girlfriend . media reports said the couple was on vacation together , but the girlfriend 's condition was n't known . a second victim was named as christophe tinois , 59 , from castelsarrasin , in southern france . the castelsarrasin town hall confirmed his death and said tinois had worked with the horse-riding community there . he had at least two daughters . friend jean-luc terriers said the girls ' mother died about two or three years ago and that tinois took care of her until the end . he had recently met another woman and they were in tunis on a cruise , he said . it was n't clear whether she was hurt in the attack . the town hall has organized a tribute ceremony for tinois on saturday morning . the name of the third french victim has not yet been confirmed . two colombians were killed , javier camelo , and his mother , miriam martinez camelo . javier camelo also held australian citizenship . his father survived the attack . he is a retired colombian army general . the family was on a trip to celebrate the son 's graduation . four of the victims were from the country 's northern piedmont region . the media office of turin city hall named them as : orazio conte , 54 , a turin city administration employee ; antonella sesino , also 54 and a city administration employee ; francesco caldara , 64 , a retiree ; and giuseppina biella , 70 . a vigil was held thursday night in turin to support the families of the victims and stand against terrorism . in a telegram from the vatican , pope francis expressed `` strong condemnation to all the acts against peace and the holiness of human life . '' the italian foreign ministry told cnn that six italian tourists were wounded . russia 's foreign ministry confirmed the death of a tourist , galina potapenko , who was born in 1962 , according to russian state news agency tass . her remains were `` found among the earlier unidentified bodies of foreign tourists , '' it said . another tourist , nadezhda lukyanova , was being treated for a wound to her arm at a military hospital in tunis , tass cited the ministry as saying . the two women had met up in the southern russian city of krasnodar , where potapenko lived , and traveled to italy together , the russian embassy said earlier , according to tass . they reached tunisia on an italian cruise . the japanese ministry of foreign affairs said three japanese nationals were killed and three others wounded . public broadcaster nhk and other local media said the dead were all women : machiyo narisawa , 66 ; chiemi miyazaki , 49 ; and miyazaki 's 22-year-old daughter , haruka miyazaki . haruka miyazaki had just graduated from a university , the media outlets reported . two poles and a belgian were listed among those killed . three tunisians were also among the dead . cnn 's junko ogura , karl penhaul , ray sanchez , livia borghese , jessica king , claudia rebaza , richard allen greene , sandrine amiel , emma burrows and ashley fantz contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned , former bob jones university president bob jones iii has apologized . `` i take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric , '' jones said . `` this reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago . '' the weekend apology came days after the conservative christian school in south carolina received a petition asking for an apology for a statement jones made to the associated press in 1980 at the white house . `` i 'm sure this will be greatly misquoted , '' jones said at the time . `` but it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in israel 's day against murder and rape and homosexuality . i guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned , if murderers were immediately killed as the bible commands . '' when he made the comments , jones was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the white house with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the civil rights act to homosexuals . `` upon now reading these long-forgotten words , they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger -- were my name not attached , '' jones said in saturday 's statement . `` i can not erase them , but wish i could , because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching . '' bob jones university has long been a center of controversy for its fundamentalist stances . in 1975 , the school adopted rules banning interracial dating . bju received national attention on the issue in 2000 when george w. bush , then a presidential candidate , visited the campus . the uproar over the ban prompted the school to drop it . the petition by bjunity , a group that bills itself as a network `` for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , questioning , intersex and straight affirming people affected by fundamentalist christianity , '' garnered more than 1,900 signatures . `` we are grateful that bob jones iii has taken responsibility for these words ; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows , '' the group 's website said . `` this means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- there are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are u.s.-born . the biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges . that includes the little things we take for granted . like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity . imagine not having a driver 's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it . erika andiola does n't have to imagine . until recently , the 27-year-old phoenix resident and co-director of the arizona dream coalition was barred from having a driver 's license by arizona . the reason : she is an undocumented immigrant born in mexico and brought here as a child by her mother . given that she arrived in the united states when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the u.s.-mexico border longer than she lived on the other side , andiola considers herself an american and this country her home . under deferred action for childhood arrivals , which was initiated by the obama administration , more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit . andiola is one of the recipients , having been granted daca protection in november 2012 and a renewal since then . from that point , had she lived in another state , the process for getting a driver 's license might have been much smoother . but she lives in arizona , which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in phoenix , work in restaurants in tucson and make beds at ski lodges in flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done . to push them out the door , legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of latinos . in august 2012 , on the same day that daca took effect , arizona gov. jan brewer issued an executive order preventing the program 's recipients from obtaining driver 's licenses or other public `` benefit . '' brewer 's order was challenged in court . two years later , in july 2014 , a three-judge panel of the 9th circuit court of appeals struck down the arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the u.s. constitution . with that , the estimated 22,000 daca recipients who are also residents of the grand canyon state were free to apply for driver 's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else . andiola got her arizona license earlier this month , after paying a $ 25 fee that she 'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it . i wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her . and i was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native-born see driver 's licenses compared to people like her . `` there is a pretty big difference , '' andiola said . `` i think it 's because we fought really hard for it . people born here might not ever think about their driver 's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police . for us , it 's a reminder of the fruits of our labor . think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows . '' other privileges get taken for granted by the native-born , she said , such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in-state tuition that you 're entitled to pay as a state resident . `` when it comes to higher education , i do n't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it , '' andiola said . `` i have nephews who are citizens . i 'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal , in my case , to attend college and pay in-state tuition and have it taken away . it was a big hurdle , and i almost dropped out . i want them to understand some of the privileges they have . '' finally , there 's the right to vote . undocumented immigrants ca n't do it , and yet many of those u.s. citizens who can do n't bother going to the polls . `` look at what we 've done to bring change , '' she said . `` imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote . a lot of americans do n't learn the political process . and you do n't feel you need to until you struggle to drive , to vote , to just be allowed to stay with your family . '' listen to her , america . this is an exemplary country , and it 'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them , treat them with care and put them to good use .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- six months ago this week omar received a panicked phone call from his friend and fellow student . `` i was in my dormitory writing a paper and a friend called me in desperation from a bus . he said they were being shot by police , '' omar explained . he has not heard from his friend since . omar is a student at the raúl isidro burgos rural teacher training college of ayotzinapa , in guerrero state . his friend is one of 43 students who were subjected to enforced disappearance in september of 2014 . as the days and weeks passed , the mexican authorities stalled and obfuscated . despite worldwide attention on the issue , they have , for months , failed to properly investigate all lines of the case , especially the worrying allegations of complicity by armed forces . in january , i traveled to the ayotzinapa college . there , in the college hall , surrounded by murals of mexico 's revolutionary leaders , i met the families of the disappeared students . for the past six months , mothers , fathers , sisters and brothers , as well as other relatives and community members , have been campaigning relentlessly , demanding answers from the authorities about what happened to their loved ones . it was an emotional and difficult meeting ; there were tears of sadness and disappointment . mothers and fathers spoke of counting the seconds since they last saw their sons , and expressed frustration at how they and their boys have been portrayed as troublemakers by the authorities and the media . these are people who have lived in poverty , whose communities have been historically abandoned by the state ; for many , their missing son was the first of their families to go to school . now , so many hopes and dreams have been shattered . i have witnessed all kinds of human tragedies , but there can be few things as painful as the torment of not knowing where a loved one is . the past months have been a roller-coaster for these families , and all of us who support and accompany their struggles . but a constant factor has been the mexican government 's failure to respond effectively and address these grave human rights violations . a prime example of this is how , on november 7 , 2014 , the authorities announced that human remains had been uncovered in a rubbish dump and a nearby river in cocula , and the then-attorney general jesús murillo karam announced weeks later that he was prepared to close the case . according to the prosecutor , he was satisfied that the findings of his office 's investigation were sufficient proof of what happened . however , only one of the missing students has been identified through dna tests . other human remains are still being tested , and it seems that the whole investigation so far has been based only on the testimonies of three gang members . you do n't have to be attorney general to know that this is far from conclusive proof . but amidst the sadness of the families i met , there was a calm and steely resolve . these 43 mothers and fathers have decided they can not accept the silence or half-answers they have been given by the government , instead they are demanding the truth . one father explained to me how the horror of that day has transformed them all from peasant farmers to detectives and campaigners . if the authorities wo n't push for proper investigations , then they will . they have been campaigning vocally for the truth ever since . the tragic reality is that these 43 students were only the most recent we have heard of in a long line of the disappeared . according to official figures , 24,748 people have disappeared or gone missing in mexico since 2007 , and almost half of them during the current administration of president peña nieto . fortunately the international community has stepped up . recently the inter-american commission on human rights established a group of independent experts to review the official investigation into the enforced disappearance of the students . in february , the united nations ' committee on enforced disappearances produced recommendations on how to deal with disappearances in mexico . the committee concluded that there is a context of generalized disappearances in a great part of the country . it has asked the government to prevent acts of intimidation and harassment toward the families of the disappeared and has suggested setting up a dna database of missing people and a registry of disappearances . however , even these international calls are going unheeded . just hours after the u.n. committee published its conclusions and recommendations , the mexican government disregarded them . this is a worrying sign that the government is not stepping up and taking this human rights crisis seriously . on march 3 , mexico appointed arely gómez gonzález as the new federal attorney general . we had hoped that she would forge on where her predecessor failed and get to the root of the corruption and impunity that lies behind this terrible tragedy . however , her recent statements -- that the disappearance of the 43 students is an `` isolated case '' and that there is no confirmation of grave human rights violations in this case -- are shocking . for omar and the others waiting for news , it is only full accountability and pursuit of justice that can address the horrors they have seen and experienced . `` the government 's response has been nothing but disrespectful and insensitive , '' omar said . `` i 'm alarmed about what happened but i 'm not afraid . we will never give up our fight for justice . '' amnesty international and i will be there alongside them every step of the way .
dhaka , bangladesh -lrb- cnn -rrb- at least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed thursday in southwestern bangladesh , police and fire officials told cnn . many of those injured were in critical condition , said mohammed bakir hossain , the top government physician of bagerhat district . mohammad niazmur rahman , the fire and civil defense official coordinating the search and rescue effort , said early thursday evening that two people had been pulled alive from the rubble and as many as 30 others are believed to be still trapped . deputy inspector general of police of khulna range sm monir uz zaman said the number of those still trapped was unclear `` as we 're not sure how many people were working inside . '' the collapse took place around 1 p.m. -lrb- 3 a.m. et -rrb- in mongla , a port city in the asian nation 's bagerhat district . the factory is owned by sena kalyan sangstha , a welfare organization for former bangladeshi troops and their beneficiaries , according to rahman and other local officials . video from boishakhi tv showed medical workers tending to the injured as they were wheeled into a local medical facility caked in dust . deadly incidents at factories and other buildings , sadly , are nothing new in bangladesh . the worst happened on april 24 , 2013 , when a nine-story building that housed five garment factories collapsed . rescuers managed to save the lives of more than 2,400 people , but more than 1,100 died in the horrific accident . and a november 2012 apparel factory fire on dhaka 's outskirts killed at least 117 people , some of whom jumped from the building to escape the flames . most of the dead were women , almost half of them burned so badly that dna tests were needed to identify them . that blaze led to the convictions of 13 people for gross negligence of safety measures and spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers ' rights in bangladesh . the government responded by revamping laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions , and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5 % of their profits toward a workers ' welfare fund . the government also boosted minimum wages from $ 38 to around $ 68 per month . yet this has n't stopped more deadly incidents , including the january deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a dhaka factory . farid ahmed reported from dhaka and harmeet shah singh from new delhi . greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's sugam pokharel and kunal sehgal contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- eight american aid workers who were exposed to ebola in sierra leone have been flown back to the united states where health authorities will watch them closely for signs of the disease , according to the centers for disease control and prevention . three more exposed workers are due to arrive back in the united states on monday . the returning workers are clinicians for partners in health , a boston-based aid group . none of them is showing symptoms of ebola , but all had contact with a colleague who 's been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the national institutes of health in bethesda , maryland . while in west africa , the workers `` came to the aid of their ailing colleague , '' according to a partners in health statement . as the cdc investigates who else might have had contact with the ebola patient , more workers might be flown back to the united states , according to tom skinner , a spokesman for the cdc . the workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating ebola patients , and if they show signs of the disease , they 'll be admitted as patients . nurse who contracted ebola sues hospital company . four of the clinicians arrived saturday to housing on the campus of the university of nebraska medical center in omaha , according to spokesman taylor wilson . the workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing . `` they will be monitored so they 'll stay there , '' wilson said . another aid worker was flown to atlanta over the weekend and is being housed near emory university hospital , and three more workers are scheduled to arrive in atlanta on monday , according to nancy nydam , spokeswoman for the georgia department of public health . as in nebraska , the workers in georgia must stay in their housing for 21 days after the date of their exposure to ebola . `` twice a day , we 'll have visual monitoring either face to face or we 'll skype with them , or do facetime , '' nydam said . `` and if it 's skype or facetime , they 'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they 're supposed to be . '' three more exposed workers arrived saturday at the national institute of health in maryland . these workers `` will remain restricted from public places '' and have `` limited movement , including no mass transportation , '' according to a statement from christopher garrett , a spokesman for the maryland department of health . the heath care worker with ebola was in serious condition friday , the nih said . details about the patient 's identity were n't released . the patient is the second with ebola admitted to the nih hospital . nina pham , a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital dallas , was admitted to nih in october after she contracted the disease while treating liberian national thomas eric duncan . pham recovered and was released free of disease . duncan died . emory , the nih and nebraska are three of only four hospitals in the united states that have biocontainment units to deal with a highly infectious disease such as ebola . more than 10,000 people have died in a west african epidemic of ebola that dates back to december 2013 , according to the world health organization . almost all of the deaths have been in guinea , liberia and sierra leone . ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person . cnn 's carma hassan , joe sutton and eliott c. mclaughlin contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- an investigation by the charlottesville , virginia , police department has found no `` substantive basis '' to support the allegations of a university of virginia student that she was gang raped at a fraternity there . the allegations were first revealed in a story in rolling stone magazine that was initially widely circulated and then increasingly widely doubted . `` that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to jackie '' on the day in question , police chief tim longo said regarding the uva student and her allegations . and longo said he welcomes any further information that may still be out there . that said , there remains one thing we certainly do know -- that gang rapes just like what jackie originally alleged do happen -- too often , and all over america . here 's one measure : today the department of justice 's bureau of justice statistics released a new report showing that 80 % of college rapes and sexual assaults go unreported to police , and 67 % of such attacks by non-students go unreported . it would be a terrible and infuriating mistake to use the confusion around jackie 's story as a convenient way to discount this reality . while rolling stone 's reporting was clearly shoddy , for example , some writers who initially poked holes in jackie 's story did so for ideological motives . for instance , even before the reporting lapses were revealed , conservative commentator jonah goldberg called jackie 's story unbelievable . `` it is not credible , '' goldberg wrote in the los angeles times . `` i do n't believe it . '' instead , goldberg insisted , jackie 's account was `` a convenient conversation for an exposé of rape culture , '' something , incidentally , goldberg also doubts to be real . '' ` rape culture ' suggests that there is a large and obvious belief system that condones and enables rape as an end in itself in america , '' goldberg later wrote in national review . it 's all hogwash , says goldberg , alleging that the very idea of `` rape culture '' is just `` an elaborate political lie intended to strengthen the hand of activists . '' in other words , whatever the reality of what happened to jackie , goldberg and others were skeptical because they simply do n't believe rapes like that happen with the participation of groups of assailants , let alone the complicity of bystanders . this is where they 're mistaken . on october 24 , 2009 , in richmond , california , a 15-year-old girl was repeatedly raped by a group of young men in a courtyard outside their high school homecoming dance . six assailants were eventually tried and ultimately pleaded guilty or were convicted . over two hours , as the assault occurred , as many as 20 other people watched . `` as people announced over time that this was going on , more people came to see , and some actually participated , '' said lt. mark gagan of the richmond police department . the witnesses did n't report the crime to police . on august 12 , 2012 , a 16-year-old girl who was incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players in steubenville , ohio . in the backseat of a car and later in the basement of a house , the two assailants stripped their victim naked and took turns , one inserting his fingers into her vagina , the other forcing his penis into her mouth . this is not in dispute . both football players were convicted of the crime . as the crimes were taking place , friends took pictures that were shared with other friends . ultimately , ohio investigators confiscated 17 cell phones used in sharing the pictures . some of those at the party even posted pictures of the unresponsive girl , being carried by her wrists and ankles , on twitter with words like `` rape '' and `` drunk girl . '' in steubenville , four adults have been indicted after being accused of covering up the incident , including the school superintendent . on may 11 , 2014 , an 18-year-old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by three students at a party after their high school prom . the three alleged assailants , all prominent athletes , have been charged with multiple counts of aggravated assault and are awaiting trial . according to police , at least one person witnessed the assault in the room where it took place and several other people at the party knew it was happening . but no one stopped it . in june 2014 , a 16-year-old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped . she does n't remember what happened , only passing out and waking up the next morning with her clothes messed up . but weeks later , the young woman received text messages of photos showing her unconscious and undressed , apparently taken at the same party . the photos went viral on the internet , with twitter users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position , mocking the alleged victim . when the houston press asked someone who posted such a picture on twitter why he did it , he simply said he was `` bored at 1 a.m. and decided to wake up '' his twitter feed . this is by no means an exhaustive account of incidents in which young women have been gang raped while bystanders have either cheered the crime , hidden it or stood by in silence . and while we do n't know whether something terrible happened to jackie , it would be truly tragic if we let this incident cast doubt on all allegations of rape and sexual assault . too often rapists are given the benefit of the doubt , even in the case of overwhelming evidence , while female victims are shamed -lrb- see multiple bill cosby allegations -rrb- . anti-feminists have it wrong . no one , myself included , wanted jackie 's story to be true . that 's absurd and offensive . we should not use this case to undermine the pervasive reality of rape culture . whether jackie was or was n't sexually assaulted does n't change the fact that many women have experienced sexual assault . when feminists raise our voices about rape and sexual assault , we are n't cheering on victimhood . we 're screaming for something to be done .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- nigerians go to the polls on march 28 in a tight contest , which is getting extra attention after the original date was rescheduled at the last minute . many voters will be holding their registration card in one hand , and their mobile in the other -- making democratic history with the help of tech . in africa 's largest mobile phone market , programs to encourage citizens to get involved in the election have been gaining traction . `` nigerians are looking for information , '' says femi longe , co-founder of co-creation hub which meshes tech and social issues . `` technology is helping people get involved in the conversation around democracy and elections , which is very important , as the general interest in the air has waned since the voting date was changed . '' as incumbent goodluck jonathan prepares to face-off against former military ruler muhammadu buhari , longe and his team have developed techsquad -- a gang of geeks who work on web-projects that help citizens vote . pre-vote prep . one such project is govote.ng , a popular website that is focused on the registration process -- that 's crucial as in africa 's most populous country , with over 170 million citizens , the logistics can be staggering . `` most nigerians have no idea where they are registered , '' explains longe . `` we want to simplify the entire election process , -lsb- and -rsb- make it responsive to users . '' people log on to the site to see whether they are registered with the nigeria independent national electoral commission -lrb- inec -rrb- and , if not , they can find out how and where to register . techsquad says approximately 10,000 people visit the site each day . finger 's influence . other squads concentrate on the next step . youth charity yiaga has set up thumbpower which gets nigerians to `` use your thumb wisely . '' sections like `` who can vote '' and `` where and when '' set out the process in language anyone can understand . interactive maps connect users to local activists and the countdown clock is a reminder that the new elections date is approaching fast . `` the rescheduling of the election ... did affect the level of voter enthusiasm , '' explains yiaga program manager , cynthia mbamalu . `` while there are certain concerns about security and the guarantee of free , fair and credible elections , the interest in this election is founded on the belief that this time votes will count . '' personality problem . this election will be the first since nigeria re-calculated it 's gdp and pulled ahead of south africa to become the continent 's biggest economy . with a nominal gdp of $ 510 billion , and an oil sector that makes up 96 % of total export earnings , the outcome of the vote will be closely watched by policy makers and businesses all over the world . politicians , however , stand accused of relying on personalities rather than policies when it comes to winning votes . `` the strength of a leader 's personality and his key personal networks are playing a very strong role , '' says jasper veen , nigeria director at national democratic institute . `` both flag-bearers occasionally attempt to articulate policy positions -- it is still a far cry from policy-based politics . '' and this is set to be a particular issue in this poll , as some seek a strongman who can defeat boko haram militants in the north-east -- the main justification authorities used when explaining the decision to delay the vote by six weeks . to fight this popularity contest , techsquad collaborated with the centre for democracy and development -lrb- cdd -rrb- to produce ngmanifesto.org , which explains what the parties plan to do to improve education , the economy and infrastructure . and once a government is elected , the site will track whether election pledges become reality . ` quick count ' technology will also play a big role on voting day . a representative volunteer network of 4,000 observers trained by transition monitoring group -lrb- tmg -rrb- will corroborate official election results using a system of text messages . the smss are coded so they can not be intercepted , and also to ensure the data can be organized and communicated quickly . the process aims to bring transparency to the elections , and will be assisted by niger 's former prime minister , mahamadou danda , who is part of a smaller team of international observers organized by the national democratic institute . such independent observation is likely to speak to the thousands of citizens concerned with governance in the country . a recent afrobarometer poll found that 68 % of respondents are `` not very '' or `` not at all '' satisfied with the way democracy is working in nigeria . another approach to inspire citizens to get involved in the election is the nigerian constitution app which has been downloaded almost 1 million times according to the indigo trust . by making the constitution available on mobile phones , the app aims to teach citizens about national laws and inspire them to vote . and there 's also budgit -- a site that publishes state and federal budgets for all to see . the list of election-based websites and apps goes on -- too many to mention here . but , while the election outcome is yet to be seen , it seems that the tech involved could bring a formidable force to the ballot box . more from marketplace africa . read this : cooking up a recipe for tasty profits in uae . watch this : banana fiber transforms lives in uganda .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- three decades ago , steve mccurry took arguably the most iconic picture of all time . yet even after all this time , the pre-eminent photographer brims with enthusiasm when he talks about `` afghan girl . '' `` i knew she had an incredible look , a penetrating gaze , '' he recalls . `` but there was a crowd of people around us , the dust was swirling around , and it was before digital cameras and you never knew what would happen with the film . `` when i developed the picture , i knew it was special . i showed it to the editor of the national geographic , and he leaped to his feet and shouted , ` that 's our next cover ' . '' not only did `` afghan girl '' become the magazine 's next cover , but the most successful in its distinguished history . the striking portrait of 12-year-old sharbat gula , a pashtun orphan in the nasir bagh refugee camp on the afghan-pakistan border , was taken in december 1984 and published the following year . the woman , now in her forties , has recently been found to be living in pakistan . when mccurry reflects upon its popularity , what excites him most is the impact that this single image has had on the real world . `` people volunteered to work in the refugee camps because of that photograph , '' he says . `` afghans are incredibly proud of it , as the girl is poor but shows great pride , fortitude and self-respect . `` it drew attention to their plight , and inspired a lot of people . '' it also led the national geographic to set up the afghan children 's fund -- and meant that to this day , mccurry is never charged a fare by appreciative afghan taxi drivers . the portrait forms the centerpiece of a major retrospective exhibition of mccurry 's work , which opened recently in monza , italy , and will run until 6 april . `` it 's great to look back on my work and see how themes and connections have emerged . but i am never even remotely thinking of retiring , '' the 64-year-old tells cnn from his studio in new york . `` there are so many new places and stories that fascinate me . i have a long list of places to visit : iran , madagascar , mongolia , russia . `` i believe that when you find something you love , you should do it your whole life . why would you retire from doing what you love ? it 's just not what we do . '' the famous photograph is just one of thousands of extraordinary pictures that mccurry has taken over a 40-year career , during which he has won dozens of awards . one which is displayed prominently in his retrospective exhibition was taken in kuwait in 1991 , during the first gulf war . it shows three camels silhouetted against an explosion of fire and smoke . `` saddam hussein had blown up 600 oil wells , '' he recalls . `` it was an environmental catastrophe . lakes of oil were leaking all over the country , and seeping into the gulf . `` half of it was on fire . there were geysers of oil spurting out of the earth , making it like midnight during the day . '' he spotted the camels running along the edge of an oilfield , and followed them in his jeep . but they had been blackened by the oil , and there was no way to capture a picture of them against the black cloud behind . `` suddenly they ran in front of a burning area , and they were illuminated by fire , '' he says . `` i took the shot , and then realized i had driven into a minefield . `` i had to carefully back out , following the tire tracks i had made on the way in to avoid getting blown up . '' for many years , frontline war photography like this was mccurry 's stock in trade . indeed , it enabled him to make his name . born in pennsylvania in 1950 , mccurry -- whose right hand was permanently damaged when he fell down some stairs at the age of five -- studied theater arts at penn state university . two years after graduating , he moved to india in search of a freelance photography career . his big break came in the late 1970s , when he disguised himself in afghan clothes and crossed illegally into afghanistan , just before the soviet invasion . there he took a set of searing photographs of people who were being attacked by their own government . `` as soon as i crossed the border , i came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out , '' he says . `` they were literally destroying whole villages with helicopter gunships . `` this was a profound situation that really needed to be told , and few people could get access to it because it was too remote . `` i got completely caught up in the story . that 's when i knew that this was what i did -- this was me . '' against a background of the cold war , the russians backed the afghan army and americans supported the mujahideen . the lens of the western media quickly swung towards the region , and mccurry happened to be already embedded . his pictures were soon appearing in the new york times , time and paris match -- but not before mccurry had escaped from afghanistan by crossing the tribal areas on foot , with his precious film sewn into his clothing . this was the beginning of many years of war photography , which he now describes as `` the gritty period '' of his career . he covered the iran-iraq war , the gulf wars and several conflicts in afghanistan , as well as those further afield in lebanon , cambodia and the philippines . `` when you 're working in a war zone , you 're living moment to moment with people trying to kill you , '' he says . `` there are so many ways i could have been killed , with guns , bombs and shrapnel . you live with fear you could cut with a knife . `` several times i was held up at gunpoint . my camera and money have been robbed , people have broken into my hotel room while i was sleeping . `` many times i thought that i had pushed things too far , that it was not a good idea to enter this skirmish or battle . many times i have thought that this is n't going to end well . `` but i have found that i get completely consumed by the importance of the story i am telling , the feeling that the world has got to know . it 's never about the adrenaline . it 's about the story . '' has frontline reporting become more dangerous ? `` it has always been dangerous , but now there is the added dimension of trying to grab headlines , '' he says . `` you might have got kidnapped or shot in the past , but not beheaded . there was no wish to create a heinous piece of theater . `` but we ca n't give in . these stories have to be reported , and writers and photographers have to continue telling them . '' mccurry 's portfolio is far broader than his war photography , however . he has worked all over the world , from the jungles of central africa to the mountains of tibet , each time seeming to capture the soul of the people he photographs . `` my camera acts as a shield when i 'm photographing something horrific , as it 's easier to look at distressing sights through a viewfinder , '' he says . `` but when i 'm not in a war zone , having a camera helps me talk to people , interact , and get involved . `` to take a good picture , you need to spend time with people until they trust you and forget that you 're there to photograph them . `` i try to make eye contact when i take a portrait , as it seems to allow you to understand the person , to see their story written on their face . '' the advent of the digital camera , he says , has made his job easier . `` i 'm not one of those photographers that hankers after the good old days , '' he says . `` digital photography is better than film ever was . '' although everybody is taking pictures with camera phones , he says , this is `` just noise '' , and does n't `` dilute the value '' of a truly great photograph that will endure and be memorable . '' `` there has to be an emotional component to the picture that you connect with on a profound level , '' he says . `` once you see it , you ca n't forget it , and it is so compelling and powerful that it becomes part of the cultural landscape . '' like `` afghan girl '' ? he pauses . `` yes , like that . '' steve mccurry - oltre lo sguardo runs until april 6 , 2015 at villa reale di monza .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- through his work in fashion , erik schnakenberg was drawn to the classic americana style that has seen a revival in the past decade . he was turned off by the price tag of american-made clothing : basic crew-neck tees starting at $ 50 , unembellished selvedge denim jeans priced at $ 250 and up , oxford cloth button-downs cut and sewn in los angeles ranging from $ 150 to $ 300 . `` it 's that effortless design that most guys look good wearing , but it was n't really happening for anyone except at the higher price point , '' schnakenberg said . to help shrink the gap , schnakenberg and his los angeles neighbor , sasha koehn , started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to `` made in usa '' fashion . buck mason has been up and running since late 2013 , offering a focused collection of american-made garments . prices range from $ 24 for a t-shirt to $ 155 for its most expensive pair of jeans , about 25 % to 50 % less than comparable brands boasting the `` made in usa '' label . how do they keep costs down ? by focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in venice , california , they say . with the help of the internet and social media , they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores . `` it did n't make sense for us to not do it this way , '' koehn said . `` maybe that 's us being naive or not thinking like a traditional business manager , but i do n't see how we could have got this started any other way . '' brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail , and it 's still a big gamble for most . traditional middlemen such as department stores , chains and boutiques help legitimize brands and expose them to consumers faster than brands may be able to build their own fan bases . but some small businesses are finding the cost of that exposure too onerous . by selling directly to consumers , brands increase their margins , control inventory based on their own projections and do n't have to worry about returns from retail store customers . they also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers , said jack w. plunkett , ceo of market research company plunkett research . fueled by venture capital investors , there has been strong growth in new direct to consumer brands , and not only in clothing , plunkett said . but very few actually manufacture in the united states because of the high cost of doing business , especially compared with global competitors . for buck mason , manufacturing in the united states is a matter of principle and direct to consumer a means to that end , schnakenberg said . `` it 's that idea of looking at our product and taking pride in creating something from scratch . we may not sell 100 million t-shirts , but we can say we 're to create one thing and make it all here and be part of the process , '' schnakenberg said . to make direct to consumer work , buck mason and other plucky entrepreneurs are mixing aspects of traditional business models with customized approaches to production and marketing , taking on much of the work typically done by outside parties . they sell through their own websites and stores , retaining absolute control over branding and merchandising . they build audiences through social media , using it as a branding tool and a forum to seek customer feedback on styles and colors , forming relationships in the process . but it takes more populating a web store or instagram feed with aspirational images of attractive people to reduce margins . brands offering specialty products that stand out have a better chance of surviving , depending on the product and its place in the global market , plunkett said . `` overall , this is positive for the sustainability of u.s. manufacturing , but there are many cases in which it will be extremely difficult to have competitive prices when manufacturing here , '' he said . instead of designing various products in different colors and styles , fledgling brands have found success in getting just a few items right , developing a cult-like following and adding products based on customer feedback . it 's a model that has worked for adele berne and mike kuhle , who launched the e-commerce arm of their new york storefront , epaulet , in 2008 with a button-down shirt for men and women made in the city . from day one , they have sold directly to consumers through their website and store , using social media to build a fan base that enjoys geeking out as much as they do over fabric origins and stitching details . since then , they have expanded to accessories and footwear , and they offer custom suiting and shirts . along the way , they have earned a reputation for offering quality products sourced and made in the united states and europe . they partner with esteemed brands including shoemaker alden and suit maker southwick on products and offer a handful of other brands for sale . through social media , kuhle says , epaulet has cultivated a fan base interested in the stories behind the brand , its creators and its manufacturing partners . their customers see the value in paying more for products made in the u.s. or europe , and they keep coming back . `` your product has to be unique , and it has to be something people want , whether it 's filling a void for something people do n't know they want yet , or it 's something you see in market that you could do better , '' berne said . buck mason launched with a simple t-shirt , working with a knitter in los angeles to develop a slub cotton before sending it to a mill outside the city . when it sold out , the company started working on a five-pocket selvedge denim jean sourced from north carolina and cut and sewn in los angeles . it 's an a la carte approach to production that takes more time and attention than the full-package manufacturing typically used by larger brands to fill big orders under one roof . the upside is that it keeps shipping costs down and allows buck mason to respond faster to market demands by placing small orders with a quick turnaround . chris sutton started out making one pair of jeans at a time in his cincinnati , ohio , workshop . as demand for noble denim grew , sutton and his wife , abby , scaled up production by partnering with a tennessee factory that , like most remaining textile manufacturers , had seen better days . as the suttons learned more about the factory 's history and the town it once supported , they realized it needed more business to create sustainable employment opportunities . it was `` hipster and naive '' of them to think they could make a significant impact with small runs of premium jeans , abby sutton said , and they started pondering new products . they tested the waters with a small run of sweatshirts . after selling out within days , the couple decided to launch a kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new business . sweatshirts sold under the victor label will be made from organic cotton in the same factory as noble denim . unlike noble , which is sold in a few stores , victor will be sold directly to consumers through the company 's website and its brick and mortar store in cincinnati . cutting out the middleman allows noble to control its brand instead of relinquishing control to wholesalers and create `` stability '' in terms of sales expectations , abby sutton said . `` everyone is oddly reliant on each other but not in way that encourages innovation . '' it also creates a quicker `` feedback loop '' through which the suttons can listen and respond to customer feedback . that 's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the `` made in usa '' movement even though they wanted to . through victor , whose products range from $ 25 for a tee to $ 85 for a hooded sweatshirt , the suttons hope to rehab american-made style 's reputation as exclusively high-end and inaccessible , she said . `` there are people who value the idea of u.s.-made but have never taken the step , '' she said . `` if we can make it for the same price as a gap sweatshirt , hopefully people will see it as easy choice .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- superheroes have always had a special place in my heart . i grew up in zambia in the 1980s , an era that marked the beginning of the country 's worst economic crisis . my childhood memories are of a prolonged state of emergency that was characterized by acute food shortages and an economic decline where the basic needs of the average zambian family were barely met . my siblings and i -- and our gang of friends from around the farmlands -- spent countless hours sitting on a deserted piggery wall , perfecting our extra-terrestrial code language . our goal was to send an sos out to the superheroes in the galaxies , and had our code language been refined enough to reach across the chasm of space , perhaps a spaceship would come down to earth to save us from our dreary lives and carry us away into outer space . searching for superheroes . rewind to just a few years earlier -- in the mid to late 1970s and before the economic decline -- when superheroes like superman , spiderman , batman and the incredible hulk were huge deals for anyone growing up . in our childhood eyes , these were powerful , all-embodying beings , and their brands were merchandised on t-shirts , caps , lunchboxes , toys , and just about everything . they influenced many aspects of the childhood experience to such an extent that i spent a lot of my formative years aspiring to become a superhero when i grew up . but then disillusionment set in . it dawned on me that i would never be a superhero seeing as most of them were male -- and all of them white . the frantic search for an alternative and relatable superhero that followed only resulted in more disillusionment . so many years later , in the year 2015 , it is somewhat bewildering to experience today the same disillusionment when i see so little representation of cultural minorities in popular media . this is a big deal to me . i am of that school of thought that believes that radio , television , film and other media of popular culture provide the symbols , myths and resources through which we constitute a common culture . meet ananiya . the danger of excluding cultural minorities from popular media is that this limited view starts to paint a constrained picture of what a person should look like , how they should behave and live to the negation of alternative experiences of being human . these deliberations are the basis for my graphic novel , `` the revolutionist . '' a work in progress , `` the revolutionist '' is set in the near future , on a satellite colony that is located a little off the orbit of mainland earth , and administrated by a corporation . social conformity in the interest of the collective is subliminally reinforced through symbolism and iconology , while the economy is purely corporate-driven . exploitation of human by human , and robot by human gives rise to the resistance . ananiya was only 13 years old when she joined the resistance . now at 17 , she has recently been appointed as an agent in the covert operations division . in the ensuing standoff where the corporation increasingly maintains control with an ironclad fist it is not long before the resistance galvanizes into a full-blown revolution . as the masses are thrust into a state of emergency , ananiya 's world is characterized by curfews , police raids , censorship and propaganda . will the revolution overcome ? with this literary and visual offering , i describe a world that is both like -- and at the same time very much unlike -- our own . as a young , black female , my protagonist , ananiya , is the most unlikely hero for the revolution . it would , indeed , be accurate to read her as the antithesis of the typical hero who more often than not is male , white , straight and privileged . hey , maybe someday the nine-year old version of me can grow up to become a superhero after all . see milumbe haimbe 's work here . read this : modern african art in the spotlight . read this : why i 'm still sad about child marriage . read this : why ebola is not liberia 's ` single ' story . more from african voices . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for max , the passage of indiana 's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school . max is transgender . the 26-year-old was born a female but identifies as a man . that was a tough experience in evansville : looking like a girl , everyone treating you like one , but not feeling at home in your skin . classmates made fun of him . he withdrew . he and his parents fought . now they do n't talk . making it to his mid-20s feels like a victory to him now , as does knowing that he has friends who support him , friends who are straight and gay and transgender . he had just gotten to a point of feeling accepted when the indiana state legislature passed the religious freedom act . `` this law makes me feel like i 'm being bullied all over again , '' he said . `` if i go into a restaurant and the owner does n't like me because i 'm transgender , because their religion has told them that i 'm bad , does that give them the right to refuse to serve me ? proponents of the law , including gov. mike pence , say that 's not what the law will do . he has said it 's intended to prevent the government from forcing anyone to do something that opposes their religious beliefs . some businesses and indianans are behind him . nationally influential christian evangelist franklin graham , who lives in north carolina , tweeted this week , `` thank god for politicians like @govpencein who are not afraid to take a stand regardless of political consequences . '' but there is a tidal wave of opposition throughout the state and across the country . critics say the law is a thinly veiled mechanism to legally sanction discrimination . protests have raged throughout the state and elsewhere . some religious leaders oppose it . civic groups , corporations and state governments , such as washington state and connecticut , are vowing not to to do business with indiana . the indiana chamber of commerce has blasted the law . so has the n.c.a.a. its college basketball tournament is hosting the final four in indianapolis this weekend . some businesses in the state are reacting by placing signs in windows that read , `` we serve everyone . '' indianapolis mayor greg ballard , a vocal opponent of the law , demanded : `` fix this law . ... do so immediately . '' he and others contend that because indiana , unlike other states , has no statewide law protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination , this religious freedom law is a license to discriminate . hundreds of protesters joined max in a demonstration on the streets of evansville monday . some said they would consider leaving the state because the law makes them feel unwelcome . lee flowers , 27 , organized a rally in evansville to protest the law . he grew up in indiana , but now he 's afraid to go into businesses with his boyfriend . `` this is very personal , '' he said . `` it hurts me . it really does . this is shameful for indiana . is anyone infringing on someone 's religion ? no . this is about giving people the legal defense to refuse business to someone they do n't like based on sexual orientation . '' casey samson of samson family leather in lebanon told cnn that he read the law , which runs four pages . he feels that the law merely protects his right to refuse to sell to a customer whose beliefs he thinks offend his catholic faith . that does n't include gay customers , he insists . `` we have no issues serving a same sex couple at all , '' he said . `` the law is strictly protecting people from the government to forcefully make them do something against their will . '' cnn asked him to give an example of what might offend him , and cause him to refuse to sell to someone . `` anything that promotes hate or a derogatory statement that someone believes is ok , '' he answered . `` i do n't want to take my personal time making a product that spews hate into the world . '' that 's never happened in samson family leather 's 35-year history , he said , but it could and that 's why he thinks the law is needed . the owner has shared his opinion with local media , and that has sparked a fierce backlash from many in the community , he said . `` we 've been called homophobic and hypocrites , '' he said . `` we 've also experienced a very large amount of support . `` our phones have not stopped ringing from people all over the state and country . we 've gotten e-mails saying ' i appreciate you standing up . thank you for standing up for our rights . ' '' indiana pastor mike woods told cnn monday that he supports the law , too . `` as someone who walks in my religious freedom all the time , i 'm glad i have something to protect me , '' he said . `` i do n't see the law as discriminatory . i just see it protecting people from any type of business or anyone trying to infringe on their religious rights . '' woods blamed pence 's office for its `` inability to educate '' people about what the law says . there should have been public meetings about it , woods said . the indianapolis star reported that the ceremony where pence signed the bill into law on thursday was `` deliberately low-key and private '' and closed to media . the governor 's staff office , it said , refused to provide names of people who surrounded pence as he signed . to samson , the law does n't explicitly use the word discrimination and that , to him , means it wo n't lead to discrimination . the law states that the government ca n't `` substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion '' and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be `` substantially burdened '' can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits . an often used example : a florist who does n't want to sell flowers to a gay couple or a baker who does n't want to make their wedding cake . those are arguably businesses that can choose which client to hire and which to reject , proponents of the law say . cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin said it 's likely that a refusal to serve a gay person would n't stand under the law , but a refusal to provide a service for a gay wedding would . `` indiana is n't the first state to establish this law , '' samson said . `` it 's nothing new for the u.s. and the state of indiana . '' samson is right that indiana is n't the first state to adopt a religious freedom law , but the situation is a little more complicated than that . indiana is the 20th state to adopt a `` religious freedom restoration '' law . for instance , bills in arizona , georgia and ohio with similar wording were proposed . the effort in arizona failed in 2014 . georgia 's bill has not been voted on and the legislative session ends thursday . the ohio bill stalled in 2014 . a similar bill is proposed in arkansas . in little rock monday night , protesters demonstrated against a bill called the conscious protection act . as the bill 's creator , republican rep. bob ballinger left a meeting monday , protesters shouted : `` shame on you ! '' in the past , religious freedom laws were enacted with broad support . many were passed before the recent movement for gay rights and before the majority of states came to recognize same-sex marriage . but when it was introduced in december , the bill that became indian 's religious freedom law incited fierce debate among faith leaders , businesses and residents , the indianapolis star newspaper reports . mark ivy watched as that debate raged over the holidays and into the new year , hoping that the bill would not pass . he lives in farmersburg , indiana , where about 1,100 people live . indiana recognized gay marriage last october . ivy married his longtime partner in december . `` i understand politics in indiana . i know it 's conservative . i get that this is about politics , '' he said . `` because i can see it as politics , i 'm not mad . '' but he also said that he feels the law is `` about bigotry , plain and simple . '' `` it 's taking us back decades , removing so much progress toward equality in indiana , '' he said . ivy worries that the law could not only allow discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . he wonders if it `` could conceivably be used for jewish businesses to refuse service to muslims and christians . hindus could bar bhuddists . protestants and catholics could shun each other , '' ivy wrote in a cnn ireport . `` mainline church members could say , ` no ' to evangelicals . '' on social media , debate over the law showed no signs of letting up . in response to christian leader graham 's tweet supporting the law , someone with the username mary m tweeted , `` amen using his god given right . '' jennifer watson tweeted them back : `` no : as an elected official , his rights are not god given , they are voter given .

islamabad -lrb- cnn -rrb- pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old . shafqat hussain , 24 , was scheduled to be hanged on thursday , but a government official confirmed wednesday night with a tweet that hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours . `` we are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours , '' said shahab siddiqui , hussain 's lawyer . `` we will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need . '' hussain 's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners , who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police . his family says hussain , at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004 . unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer , whom , according to human rights groups , failed to provide any evidence or claim that hussain was a juvenile . this meant hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court . a social media campaign with the hashtag #saveshafqat trended in pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case . shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed , manzoor hussain , his brother told cnn . `` he had said that if i do n't get justice in this world , i will get it in my afterlife . '' `` i ca n't tell you what kind of night my family has had . i close my eyes and i want to forget . i ca n't express the agony we have gone through , waiting and not knowing . '' hussain was initially due to be hanged on january 19 , but under international pressure , pakistan 's interior minister chaudhry nisar called for a stay order . addressing parliament , the minister called for an investigation into the young man 's age . two months later , another death warrant was issued for hussain , with an execution date set for march 19 . since then hussain 's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president 's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest . attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts . pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an army public school in peshawar , which left at least 145 teachers and students dead . it was the deadliest act of terror in the country 's history . the decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row , the largest number in the world . the lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in pakistan and abroad . `` it 's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves , '' zohra yusuf , the chairperson of the human rights commission of pakistan told cnn . `` executions on this scale tend to brutalize society . '' earlier this week the european union released a statement on its website calling pakistan to `` reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations , in particular the principle of fair trial . '' the statement also said that pakistan is a party to an international covenant `` that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- the expulsions of two students by the university of oklahoma for their role in a racist chant will likely not be the last word on the scandal . the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity members can appeal the decision . more students might be expelled . and beyond the immediate issues around the now infamous incident , the university could experience a trickle-down impact for months , maybe years to come . writing to the two students tuesday , just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced , ou president david boren said they were being booted for `` leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others . '' they were given until close of business friday to contest the decision . no word yet on whether either will . cnn legal analyst sunny hostin said she believes there will be a constitutional challenge to the expulsions . `` it 's sort of one of the first things you learn in law school ... you may disapprove of what someone says but you still defend their right to say it , '' she said . hostin added : `` i think there 'll be the arguments that these students were students , and that in our educational systems we want people to have , maybe , even a heightened level of freedom of speech . '' also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished . already , the greek letters sigma , alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house 's facade , the house will be closed as of midnight tuesday and the university will board up the windows , following up on separate decisions by the university and the sae national headquarters to shutter the oklahoma chapter , boren said . sigma alpha epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . but he seemed to say that individual punishments could be a bit trickier . `` well , legally , our concern is we have to demonstrate exactly how the educational experience of our students was threatened or disrupted by their actions , '' boren said , `` and it really has to focus on the students on the bus . did the other students have their educational experience disrupted ? '' while he unwaveringly declared `` there is no room for racists and bigots '' at his university , the very thing that could keep the sae fraternity brothers oklahoma sooners is title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 . the law `` prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance , '' but it also provides the parameters for determining if someone is violating the federal law , boren said . any punishment must be `` carefully directed '' if it 's to pass constitutional muster , although he made it clear he hopes some of the students involved wo n't wait for legal issues to be sorted out . `` i think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus , and i hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists , '' he said . so far , no students have dropped out -- voluntarily -- but the video has cost the university 's football team a top recruit as offensive lineman jean delance said monday he was de-committing from the sooners and considering other teams . it 's an issue that ber thaddeus bailey , director of diversity , ou student government , worries about . `` i am concerned about the trickle-down effect from this incident , '' he said . `` i do want to encourage those who are considering the university of oklahoma that this is a great place to study , and we are going to continue to progress .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- andrew paul tahmooressi , the marine reservist who made international headlines during his seven-month imprisonment in mexico , has been released from a georgia jail , where he was held wednesday night . tahmooressi was arrested in twin city , georgia , on wednesday for `` driving under the influence , reckless driving , improper passing and an open container violation , '' according to a statement from emanuel county sheriff j. tyson stephens . a spokesman for the family confirmed tahmooressi 's release , saying his client , `` is very appreciative of the professionalism of the involved sheriff 's department during the course of his custody . '' jonathan franks said tahmooressi `` continues to struggle with ptsd '' and that this incident must be seen in that context . tahmooressi made news around the world after his arrest on march 31 , 2014 , at a tijuana , mexico , checkpoint . mexican customs agents found three firearms in his truck , including a .45 - caliber pistol , a pump shotgun and an ar-15 rifle . the country 's strict federal gun laws prohibit anyone from illegally bringing weapons into the country . tahmooressi maintained that he took a wrong turn on the california side of the border into tijuana and accidentally crossed the border . in november , after 214 days , he was freed . a mexican court said it found no cause to prosecute tahmooressi on charges of carrying two firearms used exclusively by the military , possessing cartridges used exclusively by the military and carrying a firearm without a license . the court also recommended he be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder . tahmooressi was held overnight in twin city , about 180 miles southeast of atlanta . he was released after posting a $ 4000 property bond .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- former male model elo used to make a living from his good looks . but after modeling for 10 years the self-confessed car nut had earned enough money to indulge his passion . he started by buying several cars , as well as customizing them for clients across the world , and in 2001 he founded the london motor museum . today is has nearly 250 automobiles . `` when i was modeling , the best part of my modeling career was -lrb- that -rrb- i was expressing what my client wanted me to do , '' he says . `` i still express what -lrb- clients -rrb- want me to express , but this time in a three-dimensional form with an engine and an exhaust and some wheels . and that is ultimate satisfaction . '' during his fashion model days , elo owned seven cars and would drive a different one each day of the week . what started as a passion gradually demanded more and more of his time , and after a while elo felt that he came to a crossroads . `` i had to weigh between continuing modeling or stopping modeling to just do cars . so i chose the latter , '' he says . `` my friends told me ` you 're absolutely crazy , look at all these beautiful women , look at all this traveling around the world . ' and i 'm like ` are you out of your mind ? look at that beautiful steel ! ' that 's the best . '' today , the car-lover 's collection includes gems such as the 1937 lincoln zephyr , and a low-riding customized cadillac which used to belong to snoop dogg -- the so-called `` snoop de ville '' . but what gives elo the most satisfaction is something less material : the feeling of freedom . `` when i drive a car , i feel like i am leaving all my worries behind , and it 's just staying behind whilst i 'm going forward , '' he says .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for decades , no one has been able to convict millionaire robert durst . not after his wife 's disappearance . not after his friend 's suspicious death . not even after he admitted he killed and dismembered his neighbor . but it may be durst who does himself in with 11 words he muttered in a restroom : . `` what the hell did i do ? killed them all , of course . '' those comments were picked up on a microphone he was wearing for the hbo documentary series about him called `` the jinx . '' apparently , the real estate heir did n't turn his microphone off when he went to the bathroom . durst now sits in a new orleans jail after his arrest saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend susan berman in los angeles . on monday , california prosecutors said durst was `` lying in wait '' when he shot and killed berman because she `` was a witness to a crime . '' she had been shot in the head shortly before investigators were supposed to come ask her about the disappearance of durst 's first wife in 1982 . durst will be transferred to los angeles to face a first-degree murder charge . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . when he goes to trial , could those 11 words be admitted in court ? here , several legal experts weigh in : . yes : . his lawyer could argue that he absolutely did . `` here 's what his attorneys are going to say : they are going to say that he had an expectation of privacy , '' hln legal analyst joey jackson said . `` and as a result of that , putting this in context , he excused himself and went into a private bathroom . '' no : . that argument might not fly , cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin said . `` that whole theory of the constitution is that you have an expectation of privacy under certain circumstances when you 're dealing with the police . but here , he 's dealing with filmmakers . '' furthermore , toobin said , durst had a microphone on . `` you ca n't have an expectation of privacy when you 're wearing a microphone . yeah , he maybe forgot , but that 's not good enough . '' yes : . the defense very well could , said jackson , the hln analyst . `` the attorneys are going to further argue that there was governmental action in as much as hbo was working very closely with the authorities . and they 're going to say , is n't it coincidental how his arrest comes on the heels of the final episode of this hbo documentary ? '' no : . cnn legal analyst paul callan does n't think that defense will work . `` in criminal law , the police ca n't wire somebody up . they have to give you miranda warnings if they 're going to take a statement from you , '' he said . `` however , if a civilian is tape-recording you , as was the case here with hbo , that 's admissible in court if it 's relevant to the crime committed . '' yes : . he could . susan criss was the judge during durst 's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him . she remembers how prosecutors did n't use many of his admissions . `` in our trial , he had been recorded on the phone talking to his wife and friends , making a lot of admissions , and the state never used that , '' she said . `` but he was aware that he had been recorded saying things that could implicate him in the murder that we were trying . '' no : . probably not . section 1220 of the california penal code says `` evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party in either his individual or representative capacity . '' in this case , durst is the declarant who spoke those words , and if they 're used against him , they could be fair game . yes : . it 's a card the defense could certainly play . `` it will be up to -lrb- defense attorney -rrb- dick deguerin to talk about , and i think he 's going to have a field day with the idea that it was n't an answer in response to a question , -lrb- so -rrb- that 's meaningless , '' cnn legal analyst mark geragos said . already , one of durst 's attorneys has said not to read too much into his client 's offhand remarks . `` your honesty would lead you to say you 've said things under your breath before that you probably did n't mean , '' attorney chip lewis told fox news ' `` justice with judge jeanine . '' `` we want to contest the basis for his arrest , because i think it 's not based on facts , it 's based on ratings , '' deguerin told reporters tuesday in new orleans . `` so we will continue to fight for bob . we want to get to california as quickly as we can so we can get into a court of law and try this case where it needs to be tried . '' no : . the prosecution could argue durst knew what was going on . `` earlier in those interviews , in a previous interview for that very program , there was a break where he was caught practicing his testimony . and so he realized ... he had a mic on , '' said criss , the judge from durst 's earlier trial . `` this is a third time he 's made that mistake . that 's amazing .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new american hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant , according to dallas police . authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where ahmed al-jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early thursday , as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow . al-jumaili 's wife was with them taking photos . dallas police spokesman jeff cotner said al-jumaili , who recently immigrated to the u.s. , had never seen snow and `` just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us . '' there is `` extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago , '' said alia salem , executive director of the council on american-islamic relations in the dallas and fort worth area . cair became involved in the case immediately after the shooting , according to salem , because of `` a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against muslims . '' salem said the muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether al-jumaili was targeted . police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime . when shooting broke out , al-jumaili cried `` i 'm hit ! '' according to cotner , basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim 's relatives . he ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later . police did not say where al-jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot . some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting , according to cotner . he said there was no interaction between the men and al-jumaili and his family . in black-and-white soundless surveillance video , one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person , dallas police officer monica cordova said . the second person is shown walking at a slower pace , holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand . approximately 13 seconds later , another person comes into view and passes by the camera , followed by a fourth individual who is walking , she said . from the vantage point of the camera , it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender , although police have said they are looking for four black males . witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle . cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting , but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon . cotner said friday that other than that , police have little to go on . `` we ca n't solve this crime alone , '' he said . authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation . north texas crime stoppers is offering a $ 5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment , police said . salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it . she said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family 's expenses , as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward . cnn 's vivian kuo contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- his satire took egypt , and the world , by storm . but now , bassem youssef -- egypt 's most famous satirist known as his country 's jon stewart -- has the public profile of a politician in retirement , leading study groups at the harvard kennedy school . `` well , you know , sometimes circumstances are not the best for you to continue a political satire show , '' youssef told cnn 's christiane amanpour in an interview that aired monday . `` sometimes jokes kind of are annoying . '' his show -- literally called `` the show , '' or `` al bernameg '' -- ran for three seasons during egypt 's turbulent and utterly confusing post-arab spring days . youssef 's biting satire left nothing unscathed -- whether the president , political and militant islam , or the military . `` there is room for satire and comedy as long as it 's acceptable by the people controlling the atmosphere . '' his incredible story from cardiac surgeon to satirist to political target is the subject of a documentary currently in production , directed by a senior producer for stewart , with whom youssef developed a close relationship . `` it 's talking about political satire , humor , how -lrb- people can -rrb- be all for a certain program or a joke , but when the joke turns on them , they kind of like turn on you , '' he said . `` and so maybe we were an equal opportunity satirist , but they were not -lrb- an -rrb- equal opportunity audience . '' the chances are small that his show would be allowed back on air , if he even wanted to do so -- `` the question is will i be allowed to do , make fun of whatever -lrb- i want -rrb- ? '' -lrb- `` who said that my country 's authoritarian ? come on , '' he joked . `` i mean , do n't put words in my mouth . we are -- it 's a very , very good , democratic country ; please , please . '' -rrb- . but he is far from idle , seemingly casting around for ways to occupy his immense talent . at harvard , he is a visiting fellow working on `` political satire and humor , and how they interact with political , social and even religious taboos . '' he is careful not to say he is teaching , as `` harvard professors are very touchy when resident fellows come here and say they teach . '' he is also writing a script for a movie comedy , and building a platform to identify talent in the arab world and allow more people to experience the extreme and unexpected success he did . `` satire did n't begin or end with my program . i mean , it is a part of people 's culture , a part of people 's thoughts . so if one program is off , there are people who will find other ways . '' his program showed the arab world in a new light for many in the west , and he said he hopes more will follow in his footsteps . it 's a counterbalance , if you will , to the messianic image propagated by isis . `` i do n't want to even call them extreme muslims . i think they are a bunch of lunatics , who instead of playing ` grand theft auto ' on video games , they want to do it in real life . '' it may not often reach a western audience , but youssef said that youtube is filled with arabs making fun of isis -- for example , setting the group 's favorite `` anthems '' to images of belly dancers . `` it happens with all religions ... , '' he said . `` so they are crazy , and they are a threat for me as much they are a threat to you . '' despite all youssef 's projects , many simply want him to return to the airwaves . is he eyeing , amanpour asked , the seat that will soon be vacated by his mentor , stewart ? `` the day that i actually have been chosen to replace jon stewart will be like -- it will be glorious , '' he said . `` but i do n't think that americans would like to take their political satire from a middle eastern guy with a thick accent . i think this is going to be even more difficult than electing a black president . `` but you know , let 's hope .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- let 's just say -- hypothetically -- you found yourself in possession of ecstasy while in ireland on tuesday . no worries . everything was cool , because it was n't illegal tuesday . wednesday could be a different story . an appeals court ruling invalidating one section of the misuse of drugs act 1977 made the controlled substances it had regulated legal for at least one day . the independent newspaper of the united kingdom said ecstasy , ketamine and magic mushrooms were three of the temporarily legal drugs . the court of appeal ruled those drugs and others had unconstitutionally been added to section 2 of the law . `` we prepared for this possibility . legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet , '' minister for health leo varadkar said in a written statement . the government had to get the new legislation through parliament so the drugs added to the law since 1977 could be considered illegal again . it should happen within 24 hours , the department of health said tuesday . drugs such as cannabis , cocaine and heroin remained illegal as did the sale of `` psychoactive substances . '' the independent said past convictions for some drug offenses will be called into question but the journal of ireland said the court 's decision will impact only cases currently in the judicial process .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- the family of ashley summers may have reason to be hopeful again . in may 2013 , when police discovered three young women who had been imprisoned inside a nondescript cleveland home for nearly a decade , summers ' family and law enforcement hoped one of the women would be ashley , who disappeared in cleveland around the same time as the other women . but the discovery turned out to be unrelated to ashley 's case and there was no new information about her whereabouts . but nearly eight years since she was last seen or heard from , the family 's optimism has been restored by an unlikely discovery her step-grandmother made on the rhode island most wanted website in january . an atm surveillance photo -- released by the warwick , rhode island , police department in late october -- depicts an unidentified woman with a familiar face , special agent vicki anderson of the fbi cleveland division said . `` this is an incredible lookalike , '' anderson said of the photo . the resemblance to ashley , who would now be 21 , is `` strikingly similar , '' she added . the woman in the photo , along with an unidentified man she appears with , was being sought by rhode island police as a suspect in a string of check and identification thefts in rhode island and massachusetts , the fbi said . ashley 's step-grandmother alerted the fbi about the photo , anderson said . `` there 's nothing that tells us that it is her , but there 's nothing telling us that it 's not her either , '' anderson said . still , she considers the surveillance footage to be a breakthrough in the case , given that the fbi has found no legitimate sightings or social media activity by ashley since she disappeared on july 6 , 2007 . `` it 's the best lead we have , '' anderson said . `` we 've had other supposed lookalikes , but nothing that has looked this similar . we consider this a huge tip for us . '' because it is not possible to see the license plate of the car the couple was driving , anderson said the fbi will rely exclusively on help from the public . `` the fbi is utilizing a billboard campaign , social media and any news outlet that will air these photos for us , '' anderson said . in the 2013 case , two of the missing women had been identified and police said they had disappeared within four years of when ashley went missing -- and within five blocks of where she was last seen . `` at first , when they said the third girl was n't identified , i was hoping one would be ashley , '' debra summers , her aunt , told cnn at the time . but the family 's nightmare continued . `` there is no new information that 's come to light about her : ashley summers is an active , open investigation , '' cleveland police deputy chief ed tomba said at the time . `` i can assure you that her disappearance was part of our questioning of the three subjects that we brought in .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- pope francis has said that all he wants is to go out one day to a pizzeria `` without being recognized . '' wishful thinking , perhaps . but when you 're the the leader of the catholic world pizza comes to you . pizzeria owner enzo cacialli personally handed the pope a pie on sunday as his motorcade drove through naples . but , not just any pizza : a naples-style thin crust creation with `` il papa '' spelled out in dough and topped with yellow cherry tomatoes , a reference to the vatican flag . a video shows cacialli , co-owner of pizzeria don ernesto , hopping a barrier with the pie in hand as the popemobile approaches . `` papa ! papa ! '' he yelled as he ran toward the open-top vehicle , apparently unimpeded by papal minders . the video shows pope francis reaching down and receiving the offering . after the hand off cacialli pumps his fist in the air , victorious , as the crowd cheers . `` i gave him the pizza and with a smile he said ` thank you , ' '' cacialli told cnn . cacialli comes from a pizza-making family . his says his father made a pizza for president bill clinton when he visited naples in 1994 . when cacialli learned pope francis was going to be in town he decided to follow in his father 's footsteps . `` it 's really hard for me to understand what i managed to do , '' cacialli said . `` giving a pizza you made with your own hands to the pope is very emotional . it 's really hard for me to express the value of this gesture for a man we really love and value , for a beautiful person full of humanity . '' cacialli is still waiting to hear whether pope francis enjoyed the edible offering .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a louisiana judge ruled monday that robert durst , the millionaire real estate heir charged with first-degree murder , will be held without bail . that 's no big surprise . in 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- durst fled to pennsylvania , where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket . as the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified monday , they revealed new details about the investigation that led to durst 's march 14 arrest , and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle . after the hearing , durst 's attorney , dick deguerin , spoke with cnn 's jean casarez . here are some key details from monday 's hearing and the interview : . durst , who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles , was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone , according to information presented in court monday . investigators knew he 'd left his houston condo with five suitcases on march 10 . and , since a warrant allowed them to track his cell phone , they saw when it pinged a tower 85 miles east , in beaumont , texas . but suddenly , he had stopped using it . investigators thought the trail had gone cold . `` they had no indication of his movement , '' said jim o'hearn , an investigator for the orleans parish district attorney 's office . but then , authorities tracked him to new orleans after he called his voice mail twice from a marriott there , o'hearn testified . that 's where fbi agents found and arrested him . last week , court documents revealed durst had a loaded .38 - caliber revolver , 5 ounces of marijuana , his passport and birth certificate , a neck-to-head latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $ 40,000 cash , mostly in $ 100 bills . among his possessions , he also had a ups tracking number . the package was later intercepted by the fbi , prosecutors said in court monday . it contained clothing and more than $ 100,000 in cash . it 's a case durst even has made himself . in `` the jinx , '' the hbo documentary that featured him , durst said : `` you ca n't give someone charged with murder bail because they 're going to run away , of course . goodbye , $ 250,000 . goodbye , jail . i 'm out . '' in a seconds-long news conference after the hearing monday , durst attorney deguerin said he had no hope for bail and the judge 's decision was not surprising . the legal team , however , did obtain `` a lot of information , '' he said , and a preliminary hearing was set for april 2 . `` all in all , i think this has been a very good day for us , '' he said on the courthouse steps . he walked off without elaborating . deguerin cast doubt monday on the validity of the los angeles arrest warrant that led to durst 's detention , and argued that items found in the hotel room search should n't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time . he also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated durst for three hours without his attorney present . since the weapons and drugs charges durst faces in new orleans are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room , this is likely to come up again . but prosecutors argued that the matter at hand monday was whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community . the judge sided with the prosecution monday . but this is just the first step in what will likely be a lengthy legal battle . `` as long as louisiana wants us here , well , we 'll stay here . we 'll fight , '' deguerin said monday . but the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in los angeles , where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against durst last week . durst awaits extradition to los angeles to face that charge . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . prosecutors accuse durst of `` lying in wait '' and killing susan berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she `` was a witness to a crime . '' berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills , california , home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst . robert durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance . `` i just do n't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested , '' deguerin said monday . `` they had a lot of suspicion . they 've always had a lot of suspicion . and that television show just added to that suspicion . '' it 's not the first time durst has been accused of murder . he admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense . fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said . on monday , police said there was a connection between durst and a college student who disappeared from vermont 's middlebury college in 1971 . in response to a question at a tuesday news conference from cnn , middlebury police chief tom hanley said : `` there 's nothing in the files to indicate -lrb- durst -rrb- was questioned '' at the time of her disappearance . `` we do n't know if they ever had any personal contact , '' the chief added . the connection in the case was one of proximity , hanley said . durst owned a health-food store in middlebury , and lynne schulze was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop . she had purchased dried prunes from the store earlier . deguerin brushed off the accusation , saying that his client `` may have been in chicago when jimmy hoffa disappeared . '' other cases in upstate new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are also getting a new look . durst was placed on suicide watch , according to police , but deguerin said last week that durst needed to be in a hospital setting , not because of the possibility of suicide , but because he has serious medical conditions . the 71-year-old is suffering from hydrocephalus , which required brain surgery a couple of years ago , deguerin said . doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head , the attorney said last week . `` at the same time he was in the hospital he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer . so he 's got some serious health issues . ... he 's lost a lot of weight . he 's not in good health , '' deguerin said . durst appeared in court monday with his head shaved , the stent prominent . deguerin also said that durst is `` mildly autistic '' and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in asperger 's syndrome and autism . `` he 's quiet and he 's reserved and he 's actually bashful . but he 's always been looked upon as a little bit odd , '' deguerin said . `` and what we discovered 15 years ago was that he 's autistic , mildly autistic , but it explains a lot of his , what others look upon as unusual or bizarre behavior . '' but deguerin said his client 's health struggles do n't mean he 's incompetent to stand trial . and deguerin said they 're eager to go to court and fight the accusations against him . `` he 's a little frail and he has some memory problems sometimes , '' deguerin said . `` but he 's not incompetent .

new delhi -lrb- cnn -rrb- a gang of robbers struck a christian school in eastern india on saturday , and one of them raped a 71-year-old nun , a senior official said . the man apparently did so , because she resisted the robbers , said p.b. salim , chief administrator of the west bengal state 's nadia district . previously , a church official had told cnn sister broadcaster cnn-ibn that three or four of the men had raped the woman . a group of seven to eight men allegedly barged into the school and its attached staff residence during pre-dawn hours , and the elderly sister superior raised an alarm and resisted , salim said . the rape was apparently punishment for it . later , the men tied her up along with two other nuns and the building guard . the robbers then made off with cash worth a few hundred thousand rupees -lrb- thousands of dollars -rrb- , laptops and other articles , salim said . the attacked nun is under medical care . `` physically , she is better . but the mental trauma will take its own time to heal , '' salim said . `` it is a very , very shameful act , first of all , to rape any woman , any female , '' father dominic emmanuel of the delhi catholic archdiocese said in televised comments . `` but this one becomes even worse because , first of all , she is an old lady and then on top of it , she is a nun . she is a religious -lrb- and -rrb- has consecrated her life to god and all her life she has remained a virgin . '' the investigation into the burglary and rape is ongoing , and no arrests have yet been made , salim told cnn . a series of rape cases involving girls , foreign tourists and a physiology student who died following a brutal gang rape in 2012 has hurt india 's international reputation . crowds have taken to indian streets to protest against rape . the nation 's lawmakers introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment . despite such action , india continues to see episodes of sexual violence . for instance , five men were arrested in kolkata in january and charged with raping a japanese tourist . police said the men operated as a gang and targeted single , japanese tourists . in december , an uber driver was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger . the incident that grabbed the world 's attention was the rape of a woman by five men on a bus in 2012 . she later died of her injuries . anti-rape activists complained when the indian government restricted the showing of a bbc documentary about rape that included comments from one of those men . he provoked outrage around the world by blaming the victim and saying the woman `` should just be silent and allow the rape . '' official data in india show that rape cases have jumped almost 875 % over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011 . but campaigners say sexual assaults are underreported because of stigma and cultural factors . experts say the causes of the high number of rapes include the nation 's patriarchy , widespread poverty and lack of law enforcement in rural areas .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- police in mesa , arizona , know some things about ryan elliot giroux , accused in a string of shootings that left one man dead and five people wounded . he 's 41 , has an extensive criminal record and served time in prison , according to online inmates records . he 's on probation . giroux used to have tattoos indicating white supremacist beliefs on his face but apparently had them removed , according to photos . one thing investigators do n't know : what caused giroux to allegedly go on a deadly rampage . on thursday morning , giroux made his first court appearance . he faces multiple charges , including murder , armed robbery with a deadly weapon , kidnapping , aggravated assault and burglary . the prosecutor requested $ 2 million bond and the judge imposed it . grioux has been sent to prison twice for felonies , including an attempt to commit aggravated assault . he was sentenced to seven years and six months behind bars in july 2007 , but was released in october 2013 , according to online inmate records . his probation runs through october 2016 . he also had a run-in with authorities in santa monica , california . he allegedly committed assault with a knife in the early morning hours of march 26 , 2006 , and was detained by witnesses , said santa monica police spokesman sgt. rudy camarena . giroux was arrested on accusations of attempted murder and parole violation , but police records were n't immediately clear on how the case was resolved , camarena said thursday . police are looking for a motive in the first shooting on wednesday , but say the other violence happened as the suspect tried to rob people and get away from authorities . the first shots were fired after the suspect got into an argument at the tri-city inn with three people that he likely knew , according to det. esteban flores of the mesa police . one man shot at the tri-city inn died , flores said . police identified him as david james williams , 29 , reported cnn affiliate knxv . the motel is across the street from the east valley institute of technology . according to a police press release , the suspect next shot a man during a carjacking at a nearby restaurant and drove away in a stolen honda accord . grioux tried to carjack another vehicle but failed , police said , and crossed the street to break into an apartment , where he shot and tried to rob a fifth person . he went to another apartment complex and shot a sixth person , police said , before fleeing to a condominium complex . flores said mesa 's swat team found grioux in a vacant second-floor condo . police used a taser stun gun to subdue him . police said one man is in critical condition at a hospital , knxv reported . the other victims , including the mother of the slain man , were treated and released from hospitals , knxv reported . authorities on thursday released a photo of a bruised giroux in which he had a tattoo on his neck but no tattoos on his face . an arizona department of correction 's photo released earlier showed a heavily tattooed giroux , with the words `` skin '' and `` head '' tattooed over his eyebrows . the number 88 was on his left temple , with additional ink on his chin and neck . `` those are typical tattoos that you do see sometimes on white supremacists , but we do n't know if that has anything to do with what happened today , '' flores said . neo-nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for `` heil hitler . '' h is the eighth letter in the alphabet , so the nazi salute becomes 88 in shorthand . flores said he believes all of the shooting victims were white , with one being white and of hispanic descent . `` i have no information that his -lrb- giroux 's -rrb- affiliations or beliefs had anything to do with what occurred today , '' flores said . news of the shootings caught the attention of the state 's senior u.s. senator . `` my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families impacted by the tragedy in mesa today , '' u.s. sen. john mccain said in a statement released wednesday . `` our deepest thanks are with the valley police and first responders who assisted the victims and tracked down the perpetrator to bring this dangerous situation to an end .

sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- a yemeni jet commanded by the capital 's houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing yemen 's deposed president in the country 's south thursday , injuring no one but marking an escalation in deadly fighting that 's erupted between forces for and against the ousted leader . the jet flew from sanaa , which houthi rebels overtook in january , to the palace in the port city of aden , where the jet conducted the strikes thursday afternoon , a senior air force official said on condition of anonymity . deposed president abdu rabu mansour hadi was at the aden palace compound when the first missile struck the grounds , but he then fled safely , a hadi aide said , also on condition of anonymity . a second missile struck near the compound , but , like the first , injured no one , two officials in aden said . another houthi-commanded air force jet fired a missile in downtown aden about a half-hour later , again injuring no one , aden gov. abdulaziz hobtour said . it was n't immediately clear what the missile struck , or what the intended target was . the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemeni military forces -- those commanded by houthis , and those led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , leaving at least 13 people dead and 21 others injured , hobtour said . the houthis , a minority rebel group that holds sway in the nation 's north but has less influence elsewhere , took control over military forces stationed near sanaa , including the air force , as it overtook the government there in january . hadi initially was put under house arrest in sanaa , but he escaped last month , fleeing to aden and declaring himself to still be president . some military forces still are loyal to hadi , including troops from his native province in the south . on thursday , clashes erupted in aden when a special forces commander loyal to the houthis , abdul hafez al saqqaf , ordered hundreds of his troops to create checkpoints at all roads leading to aden 's airport . watch : who are the houthis ? the clashes were reported to be taking place on four different fronts in the airport and a surrounding military base . passengers were stranded at the airport , with flights canceled throughout the day . al saqqaf 's forces gave up much of their ground in aden after pro-hadi forces struck them with heavy artillery and tanks , a pro-hadi military commander said on condition of anonymity . some of the wounded in thursday 's fighting were in critical condition , officials said , suggesting the death toll could rise . the houthis entered sanaa in september , demanding a greater share of political power . they took control over a period of months , seizing the presidential palace in january . the unrest has plunged yemen deeper into chaos . hadi had issued a presidential decree replacing al saqqaf two weeks ago , but the decree was not implemented . journalist hakim almasmari reported from sanaa . cnn 's jason hanna wrote from atlanta , and cnn 's jethro mullen wrote from hong kong . cnn 's brian walker contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- milan has moxy , while much of europe is painted blu . jaz in the city is playing in amsterdam come september . even increases the odds of a good night 's sleep , while tune is in harmony with scaled-down budgets . and then there 's the vibrant vib and a new venue , venu , soon arriving in dubai . these statements begin to make sense once you realize that they 're all the names of modern hotel brands . according to chekitan s. dev , a professor at the cornell university school of hotel administration , hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place . but more recently , he says , `` the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic . '' so what 's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names , replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages ? look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality , attitudes , interests and lifestyles . psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded , adventurous individuals in search of new experiences . hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly . `` hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way , '' says matthew von ertfelda , marriott 's vice president for insight , strategy and innovation . the explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game . brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global , online world , say the pros . `` thanks to social media , millennials are the first global generation , '' says dr. donna quadri-felitti , academic chair of new york university 's school of professional studies tisch center for hospitality and tourism . `` and since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting , hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world . '' for social media purposes , the number of characters in a name counts . spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity . but another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal . spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable . `` the odder the name , the less likely someone has already captured it , '' says cornell professor dev . `` that 's important in terms of intellectual property protection . '' it may explain why venu and vib are missing an `` e. '' venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand , launching its first property in dubai in 2017 . according to parent company jumeirah hotels & resorts , it 's designed to give travelers `` the freedom to write their own story , their own narrative , to build their own scene . '' best western 's new hotel entry , called vib , is pronounced `` vibe . '' `` we tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality , while also connoting a vibrant spirit , '' says dick lew , a partner at houston-based acumen design , a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image . hence vib , which is derived from `` vibrant . '' color also plays a big part in hotel branding . `` we incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo , in order to reflect the -lrb- vib -rrb- brand 's bold personality , '' says lew . moxy , the new marriott partnership with ikea , is going after `` a sassy , determined , individualistic consumer , '' according to marriott 's von ertfelda . the first moxy opened at milan 's malpensa airport in september and more are coming in europe this year . `` naming moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming , '' says von ertfelda . `` once we came up with it , we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot . `` at the same time , though , our lawyers noted the name had to be ` ownable and trademarkable . ' '' the change of spelling from moxie to moxy achieved that . according to von ertfelda , senior creative director maria rezende-heiston selected hot pink for the moxy logo to `` appeal to those who are n't afraid to express themselves '' while using a `` curved font to convey a sense of rhythm , fluidity and independence . '' color is also key to hotel operator carlson rezidor , which is hueing -lrb- sic -rrb- toward red and blu . blu came about in 2009 , after airline sas withdrew from a partnership with radisson . after the split , radisson sas , a collection of european design hotels , needed a new name . `` we wanted to replace sas with an equally short name , '' says rose anderson , vice president of branding for the carlson rezidor hotel group . `` we liked using blue from the old sas logo , because it brought in the heritage of the former brand . `` at the same time , we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world 's favorite color . '' so blue or bleu became blu , a trademarkable spelling . carlson rezidor recently announced a new red brand that will , according to anderson , `` build on the blu concept and further leverage radisson 's brand awareness .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a massive power outage spread across turkey on tuesday , blacking out a broad swath of the country and affecting some flights . prime minister ahmet davutoglu said all possible causes were under investigation , including terrorism . trams and subways were idled in istanbul -- with more than 14 million inhabitants , the largest city in the country and the fifth largest in the world . homes and offices were left without electricity . `` i am sitting in my apartment , '' cnn producer gul tuysuz reported from istanbul . `` no lights . no electricity . '' the capital , ankara , some 250 miles from istanbul , also was affected . the outage extended to 45 of turkey 's 81 provinces . the semiofficial anadolu agency quoted energy minister taner yildiz as saying the cause of the outage was unknown . yildiz , speaking during a visit to slovakia , said he could neither confirm nor deny that a cyberattack had triggered the blackout , the anadolu agency reported . flightradar24 , which maps real-time flight data on the internet , tweeted that the outage was `` affecting flights , '' and said 11 of its 16 air traffic monitoring systems receivers -- as distinct from the country 's air traffic control system -- were not working . the turkish electricity transmission co. blamed the outage on a problem with transmission lines , anadolu agency reported . the utility said an investigation was in progress , as were efforts to restore power , the news agency said . the outage began at 10:36 a.m. -lrb- 3:36 a.m. et -rrb- . nearly two hours later , according to anadolu agency , about 15 % of the power had been restored to istanbul and ankara , including in some subway stations . power also was beginning to flow again to a number of provinces that had been cut off , the agency reported . by midafternoon , yildiz said , 90 % of istanbul 's power had been restored . `` crowded places such as metro stations have been given electricity , and we believe the rest of the country should be fully powered shortly , '' he said . cnn `` s gul tuysuz contributed to this report from istanbul .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- for a generation of moviegoers in the early 1990s , `` pretty woman '' was a cultural touchstone . the breezy comedy had all the key elements of romantic fantasy : a plucky , down-on-her-luck heroine , a rich , dashing prince and a cinderella love story with a fairy-tale ending . most of all it had a lesser-known actress named julia roberts , whose radiant smile and coltish charm lit up the screen . the movie , which celebrates its 25th anniversary on monday , grossed $ 463 million worldwide and made her the biggest female star in hollywood . but how does it stand up today ? not everyone is a fan . some critics complain the garry marshall film , whose female lead is an unrefined prostitute rescued from the streets by richard gere 's elegant millionaire , degrades women and glorifies materialism . here are some of the leading pro-and-con arguments about the movie . first , the cons : . it whitewashes the realities of prostitution . the movie glosses over the less-than-glamorous motivations that can lead women into sex work , says katie hail-jares , a board member of the sex workers outreach project -lrb- swop usa -rrb- . most sex workers that hail-jares encounters through street-based outreach are not in it for a lark , or because they lack the drive to succeed , she says . they do it out of economic necessity after encountering roadblocks to traditional employment such as lack of education , a criminal record or sexual discrimination , she said . on one hand roberts ' character , vivian , is a compelling protagonist who dispels the stereotype of the drug-addicted `` crack whore '' with little ambition , hail-jares said . on the other hand , the movie implies that by virtue of her beauty , drive and apparent drug-free lifestyle , roberts is the exceptional sex worker who -- unlike her pal kit , for example -- deserves a better life . `` what 's problematic is how it portrays sex work at large , like she 's the only one worth saving , '' said hail-jares , a ph.d. candidate in criminology at american university . `` you get the sense that she 's not the norm , and that allows us to get invested in her while not necessarily worrying about the welfare of other women who fall into the -lrb- sex worker -rrb- stereotype . '' vivian 's exit from sex work thanks to gere 's character is also troubling , she says . `` in the movie she 's able to fill economic void with edward 's money but in reality that does n't happen , '' she says . it 's demeaning to women . like `` my fair lady , '' the movie is another reimagining of `` pygmalion , '' the george bernard shaw play about a crass , impoverished girl given a redemptive makeover by a sophisticated male mentor . daryl hannah was one of numerous well-known actresses who turned down the part , saying it was `` degrading for the whole of womankind . '' the vivian character is clearly intelligent , and values love over money . but she also has no apparent career goals beyond becoming the kept woman of a wealthy businessman . '' ` pretty woman ' may be a fantasy but it 's a deeply sexist , consumerist fantasy , '' wrote rachael johnson last year for bitch flicks , a feminist movie site . `` admire julia and richard 's beauty , and sing along to orbison or roxette , but never forget that it is one of the most misogynist , patriarchal , classist , consumerist , and lookist movies ever to come out of hollywood . '' it celebrates greed . although he is dutifully appearing on tv this month to promote `` pretty woman 's '' anniversary , gere in the past has publicly dismissed the movie for glorifying wall street corporate raiders like his ruthless edward character , who dismantles struggling companies . `` it made those guys seem dashing , which was wrong . thankfully , today we are all more skeptical of those guys , '' he told woman 's day magazine in australia in 2012 . the movie also depicts vivian 's evolution from streetwalker to beverly hills socialite through an orgiastic shopping spree during which gere promises to spend `` an obscene amount of money '' on her . `` ideologically , ` pretty woman ' is a love song to consumerism and capitalism , '' said bitch flicks ' johnson . '' ` pretty woman ' depicts a world where everyone is either a card-carrying member of the corporate caste or an obliging subordinate ... it is obsessed with things -lrb- hotel suites , private jets , fancy clothes -rrb- and encourages the audience to share its obsession with things . '' and now the pros : . no , it actually empowers women . despite her lowly profession , vivian is no pushover . one of the film 's earliest scenes shows her refusing kit 's suggestion that they work for a pimp , saying `` we say who , we say when , we say how much . '' later , she negotiates the terms of her relationship with edward and is quick to speak up when she feel she 's being mistreated . she humanizes him and even takes over driving edward 's borrowed lotus when he ca n't handle a stick shift . `` she dictates the way she wishes to be treated ; when he offers her the status of a mistress , she dictates the status of a full equal , '' writes brigit mccone in a more recent bitch flicks piece titled , `` why ` pretty woman ' should be considered a feminist classic . '' `` let us never forget that when the prince rescues her , she rescues him right back . '' its shopping scenes are revenge-fantasy bliss . ask some `` pretty woman '' fans to name their favorite scene and they do n't mention vivian 's swoony moments with edward . they talk about that part in the middle when she hits rodeo drive for a shopping spree . spurned at first by snooty salespeople , vivian later buys a slew of expensive outfits with edward 's money and then returns -- dressed to the nines and carrying handfuls of shopping bags -- to one boutique that had shunned her . `` you work on commission , right ? '' she asks a bitchy saleswoman . `` uh , yes . '' `` big mistake . big . huge , '' she says , turning on her heels to leave . `` i have to go shopping now . '' that 's why in the 1997 comedy `` romy and michele 's high school reunion , '' michele -lrb- lisa kudrow -rrb- tears up while watching the movie , saying , `` i just get really happy when they finally let her shop . '' lighten up . as slick entertainment , the movie works . sure , its story is ridiculous on many levels . for all its modern trappings -lrb- and r rating -rrb- it 's also deeply old-fashioned : take out the sex and prostitution and it could be a disney movie . but gere and roberts , despite their 18-year age difference , have genuine chemistry . the interplay between her goofy exuberance and his bemused stoicism is mostly effective . and roberts ' charisma carries the movie through its weaker spots . the script also has some zingers , as when edward asks , `` what makes you think i 'm a lawyer ? '' and vivian answers , `` you have that sharp , useless look about you . '' on paper `` pretty woman , '' initially conceived as a gritty drama , should n't work . but it does -- if you do n't think too much . `` all these years later , it holds up remarkably well , if you can turn off that think-piece portion of your brain , '' wrote stephanie merry this week in the washington post . '' -lrb- is she a feminist icon ? is she only worthy of love when in rodeo drive 's finest ? is this just `` my fair lady '' with sex ? just give up already and embrace the absurdity . -rrb- ''
washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. ambassador who resigned his post in 2012 amidst official criticism that he used a private email account for official business told cnn friday that he was `` very surprised '' to learn that his boss at the time , then-secretary of state hillary clinton , had been doing essentially the same thing at the same time . `` i was very surprised to learn of the double standard , '' former ambassador to kenya and air force general scott gration told cnn . gration noted that cheryl mills , the then-state department chief of staff `` obviously knew secretary clinton was using commercial email , yet she stated my use of gmail was one of the reasons i had to move on . '' the retired air force major general , who flew 274 combat missions over iraq as a fighter pilot and served as president obama 's special envoy to sudan , recalled he had been `` prohibited from sending a gmail message to a state department computer except in an emergency . '' considering that `` department of defense dot mil accounts , usaid accounts , and every kenyan account used the same routers and security firewalls as a gmail account , '' he took issue with state department protocols . `` it did n't make sense to me that the state department would ban my ` gmail.com ' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall , '' he told cnn . a spokesman for hillary clinton declined comment . spokespeople at the state department repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the state department inspector general report about the u.s. embassy being run by gration there were `` several concerns with management and leadership '' discussed , not just about his use of private email . the inspector general report charged that gration `` lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission '' and `` damaged the cohesion of embassy nairobi 's country team . '' gration said he makes `` no apology for ` rocking the boat ' in the state department to improve physical security , to enhance cyber policy , and to conduct several other initiatives that the state department inspector general misrepresented to build the case that secretary clinton 's chief of staff used to terminate my tenure as the u.s. ambassador in 2012 . '' the state department 's continued referencing of the other allegations against gration came amidst fruitless attempts by cnn to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for secretary clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 inspector general 's report against gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of `` commercial email for official government business '' which was considered to be `` flouting of direct instructions to adhere to department policy . '' as cnn reported thursday , the report stated clearly that it `` is the department 's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system , which has the proper level of security controls , '' the report stated . `` the use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss , phishing , and spoofing of email accounts , as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information . the use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions . conducting official business on non - department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies . '' asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then-boss doing essentially the same thing , gration told cnn `` i 'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy . i learned long ago to do your best , do what was right , and to have a thick skin . i still wake up each day without regrets because i still have my integrity . that said , illegal , immoral , or unethical activities should be investigated properly , not just for political gain , but because we demand this of our public leaders . that 's the only way we can preserve trust in our system of governance . punish crimes and forgive mistakes . '' gration said that his `` experience was somewhat different than secretary clinton 's use of her commercial account , yet i was ` fired ' for the use of gmail in the u.s. embassy , my insistence on improving our physical security posture , and other twisted and false allegations . i 've chosen to move on and to be better , not bitter . '' he said that `` the state department inspector general investigators and diplomatic security cyber investigators conducted a full and formal investigation into my use of gmail and the state department computers '' and `` they dismissed the allegations against me . '' the former ambassador and his wife currently live in kenya , where he is executive chairman of a company that works to bring international investment and innovation to kenya and east africa . he is no longer involved in us politics and diplomacy .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- have rick and his fellow survivors finally found a place they can settle in for the long term ? that was the question left still unanswered at the end of sunday night 's season finale of `` the walking dead , '' and a finale record 15.8 million viewers tuned in to find out the answer . rick was back in `` ricktatorship '' mode , telling the residents of alexandria that he knew what it took to survive and they should follow him . that led up to one of many moments where we gasped during the 90-minute finale . here are five of the biggest gaspworthy moments : . 1 . morgan is back . we 've literally been looking for him all season , and rick 's old friend morgan -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance , wielding a stick he used to kick walker , and human , butt when necessary . and it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing w 's on their heads , who , we would later learn , wanted to turn morgan into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled . 2 . daryl looks done for . it was daryl who happened upon that horde , and he and aaron were soon surrounded and forced into a car , with little chance of escape -- that is , until morgan rescued them . we rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that daryl might die , but that was a close one . 3 . carol and her casserole . melissa mcbride continues to steal scenes left and right lately , and her threatening of pete while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series ' history so far . 4 . glenn gets shot . we seriously thought glenn was a goner after a vengeful nicholas shot him , then left him for a large group of walkers to attack . somehow , glenn survived and attacked nicholas , but stopped short of killing him . that 's our glenn , always doing the right thing when it comes down to it . 5 . rick 's memorable walker encounter . just when you thought you 'd seen everything , rick literally squeezed a walker 's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of alexandria , in a bid to lead them toward survival . rick was then rudely interrupted by pete , who slashed reg 's throat in a fit of anger . at that point , deanna told rick to off pete , which he did . phew ! it was one of the most intense episodes of the already hyperintense series , and our group of survivors somehow made it through . fans on twitter were into it . `` that was the most intense hour and a half of my entire life , '' one tweeted .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- four years . at least 220,000 people killed -- more than one every 10 minutes . millions displaced . the syrian civil war is a human calamity and it 's getting worse , according to a furious new report from more than 20 aid groups . u.n. security council resolutions aimed at protecting civilians caught up in the conflict have failed miserably , the humanitarian organizations say in the report released thursday . `` this spiraling catastrophe is a stain on the conscience of the international community , '' says the report , whose signatories include oxfam and save the children . `` we 're worried that , as we approach the fourth anniversary , this could turn into a situation of acceptance -- ` oh , that 's just the way it is over there ' -- and that must n't be , '' nigel timmins , deputy director for oxfam great britain , told cnn . it highlights the paltry results of a security council resolution passed in february 2014 that called for an increase in humanitarian aid , a halt to attacks on civilians , an end to kidnapping and torture and the lifting of sieges of populated areas . `` in the 12 months since resolution 2139 was passed , civilians in syria have witnessed ever-increasing destruction , suffering and death , '' the report says . the syrian observatory for human rights , a london-based monitoring group , has reported that 2014 was the deadliest year so far in the grinding conflict that began in march 2011 as an uprising against the regime of president bashar al-assad and splintered into a chaotic civil war . more than 76,000 people were killed in the violence in syria last year , nearly 18,000 of them civilians , according to the observatory . the conflict has brought allegations of atrocities carried out by al-assad 's forces and enabled isis ' savage rule over parts of the country . attempts at peace talks involving the government and opposition have so far gone nowhere . as the war threatens to sow further chaos in the region , the united states and its allies are bombing isis targets in syria and working to arm and train rebel groups . the aid groups ' report , entitled `` failing syria , '' reeled off a list of worsening problems reported by international agencies : . the report called on security council members to `` use their influence with the warring parties and their financial resources to put an end to the suffering of syrian civilians . '' in washington , a group of syrian americans and other supporters gathered near the white house on wednesday to mark the four years of bloodshed and read the names of 100,000 people who were killed in the violence . a u.n. aid official told cnn of the crisis unfolding at one particular refugee camp in syria that he had just visited . `` what i saw yesterday really shattered and devastated me , '' said pierre krahenbuhl , the head of of the u.n. relief and works agency for palestine refugees who has been working in conflict zones for 20 years . around 18,000 palestinian refugees in the yarmouk camp are in `` dire '' need of food and health aid , he said wednesday , describing seeing enfeebled men and a fainting pregnant woman waiting for assistance . the ongoing conflict is adding to the plight of the camp 's inhabitants . `` you have inside the camp a number of armed groups and of course you then have government armed forces around it , '' krahenbuhl said . `` there is this link between the presence of armed groups inside and the suffering taking place .

'' if the mother on tuesday 's flight had been flying american airlines , which owns us airways , she might not have been able to travel . american has n't created a single policy for both brands , and its policy is more restrictive . a medical certificate is required for travelers wishing to fly within four weeks of their delivery dates `` in a normal , uncomplicated pregnancy , '' according to the airline 's website . she could n't travel on domestic american flights of less than five hours within seven days before and after a the delivery date without a medical certificate and permission from the airline . delta air lines does n't restrict pregnant women from flying , but the airline does n't waive ticket change fees and penalties for pregnancy . it recommends that pregnant travelers check with their doctors after the eighth month of pregnancy . southwest airlines recommends that female travelers consult with their doctors before traveling at any stage of pregnancy and warns specifically against air travel beginning at the 38th week of pregnancy . southwest goes into even more detail . `` while air travel does not usually cause problems during pregnancy unless delivery is expected within 14 days or less , in some cases , traveling by air has been known to cause complications or premature labor . `` depending on their physical condition , strength , and agility , pregnant women may , in some cases , be asked not to sit in the emergency exit row .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton 's lawyerly news conference tuesday , at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official state department business was improper , might extinguish the matter for most americans -- but it does n't get clinton out of the woods politically . the real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the bill , hillary & chelsea clinton foundation . this is the multibillion-dollar foundation hillary clinton leads alongside ex-president bill clinton and their daughter , chelsea . what we already know about the foundation 's donors is controversial : some of the corporations , banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of american law . the clintons can make a plausible case that it 's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty . as bill clinton recently told reporters : `` you 've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country . '' it 's an interesting and important debate , and most americans would probably approve the idea of putting `` bad '' money to good use . but the argument only works if clinton 's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation 's tip-toeing around ethical challenges . to figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the william j. clinton foundation shortly after he left office in 2001 . different initiatives were added over the years to combat aids , climate change , poverty and other ills ; the most high-profile of these projects , the clinton global initiative , added in 2005 , brings world leaders together to tackle the world 's problems . to make things even more complicated , the foundation 's website says its mission is supported by the clinton presidential center in arkansas , which includes an archive of the president 's papers . the foundation recently co-sponsored a black history month event with the center . the foundation 's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand . and with 350 employees spread across 180 nations , running the foundation is an expensive proposition : in 2012 , the various initiatives spent $ 214 million according to the new york times but still ended up $ 8 million in the red . who gave , and why , is hard to figure out . according to the wall street journal , `` the clinton foundation does disclose its donors , which is n't required by law . but the disclosure is limited ; dates and exact amount of the donations are n't disclosed . donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year 's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name . '' hillary and bill clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation . during hillary clinton 's years as secretary of state , the high-profile clinton global initiative split off from the larger clinton foundation , and bill clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations . hillary clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the state department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department 's ethics office . it was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title . ideally that would settle the matter , but there 's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored . an investigation by the wall street journal found that `` at least 60 companies that lobbied the state department during her tenure donated a total of more than $ 26 million to the clinton foundation , '' raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state . in one well-publicized case , hillary pressed a state-owed russian airline to buy american planes from boeing . the effort worked : boeing ended up with a $ 3.7 billion contract . -lrb- to be sure , secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase american products . it 's part of their job . -rrb- but weeks after clinton 's persuasion -lrb- what she called a `` shameless pitch '' -rrb- , boeing donated $ 900,000 to the foundation . a cnn investigation by alexandra jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the clinton foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its cgi spinoff as a way to gain favor with the clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations . in 2012 , the british bank standard chartered paid $ 667 million in fines for violating sanctions against iran and hsbc paid $ 1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in cuba , iran , sudan and myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank . both banks have been major contributors to the foundation . as jaffe notes , `` the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions , if any , the foundation placed on its fundraising operation . '' and according to the washington post , seven nations donated millions to the foundation during clinton 's time as secretary of state , including a $ 500,000 gift from algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the state department 's ethics office . that sort of corner-cutting , and the cozy-seeming connections between clinton and various corporations and governments , will be tough to explain on the campaign trail . if emails suggest clinton was aware of the corporations , banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the state department -- or worse , took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign . it 's much too early to count hillary out , of course . the clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars ' worth of good works , from lowering the price of hiv-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women . but there 's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the u.s. government while she was in office . what will matter is not why or how hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a ballerina dancing in a music box and a girl sat in an armchair drinking tea surrounded by flowers . this is how two of china 's most popular websites chose to celebrate international women 's day sunday , unleashing a storm of criticism , especially on social media , which ridiculed their home page `` doodles '' as sexist stereotypes . `` may the world treat you gently , '' the video-sharing site youku told its female users . search engine baidu had no explicit message for its visitors , but the rotating ballerina turned into a bride and then a mom with a stroller . internet users were quick to point out how the efforts of baidu , china 's biggest search engine , and youku , dubbed china 's youtube , contrasted with global rival google . its doodle depicted women in several different professions , including a scientist , artist , astronaut , chef , musician , teacher and volleyball player . `` this is how you define women and celebrate them ! '' said weibo user @zoexiaoyizi of baidu 's music box . `` google 's doodle just makes their stupidity even worse . '' guo weiqing , a professor at sun yat-sen university in guangzhou , said that the companies ' choice of imagery suggested that women are there only to be taken care of and look pretty -- and the real world of business should be left to men . `` internet companies conveying such a narrow definition of women is n't good . it 's exactly the opposite of the international women 's day mission , which is fighting for gender equality , '' he told cnn . baidu and youku did n't immediately respond to calls for comment . the doodle uproar came as chinese authorities detained several women right 's activists this weekend . some of them had planned to hold a nationwide protest against sexual harassment . on monday , five were still being held police , said an activist and a friend of the women , who asked not to be identified . beijing traditionally cracks down on activists during important meetings like this week 's national people 's congress -lrb- npc -rrb- . `` in other countries , doing such things on international women 's day is natural , while in china you get detained for fighting for women 's rights , '' she said . `` everything we 've done is mild and done legally -- we call for gender equality in the college entrance exam and more toilet spots for women , '' she added . under chairman mao zedong , women famously `` held up half the sky '' but there is a growing sense that chinese women today face more , not less , discrimination than in the past . the new york times reported last month that women make up fewer than one in 10 board members at the country 's top 300 companies . and china 's state-run media often appears more concerned with women 's looks and marital status than equal rights . showing the same tin ear as baidu and youku , the people 's daily , the communist party 's official newspaper , published an online gallery entitled `` beauty with brains .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- nigerians go to the polls saturday to determine who will lead africa 's most populous nation . the stakes are high in this election as the nation faces intensified attacks by extremist group boko haram . with security catapulting into a key issue , which candidate will voters trust to keep them safe ? as nigeria decides , here 's what you need to know : . nigeria is home to about 173 million people and is considered a powerhouse in the region . its stability is crucial to combating the growing risk of islamist terrorists , who thrive on instability . as boko haram seeks to extend its tentacles with its recent pledge of allegiance to isis , nigeria has teamed up with neighboring chad and cameroon in a counteroffensive against the terror group . and it appears to be working , with its military saying it has recaptured several key cities from the militants . the next leader will have to ensure the gains stay on track . as we have learned with isis in iraq and syria , any unaddressed local insurgency has the potential to spiral into an international problem . and let 's face it , the world does not need another failing state , especially one with such a massive population . nigeria is also one of africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the united states . it hosts many international oil companies and workers . the key issues are power , security and the economy . but with the rise of boko haram , security has taken center stage . just this year alone , the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians , human rights watch says . one of the militants ' most brutal acts was the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls last april , a majority of whom are still missing . boko haram has become increasingly brazen , seizing towns in bloody attacks and declaring them islamic caliphates . militants have bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike . although the current government is `` having successes here and there '' in its fight against boko haram , it 's not winning the war against the terror group , says ayo johnson , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on african affairs . and despite recapturing some key towns from militants , he says , the government 's big picture on security is still hazy . `` this elections will come down to who can protect nigeria , '' johnson says . `` who can make nigerians feel safe . '' nigeria overtook south africa as the region 's largest economy last year . the government has made tremendous gains on the economy , johnson says , but those gains have been buried under the constant threat of boko haram . but many complain that the country 's vast wealth from oil exports does not trickle down to the average citizen . as many as 70 % of nigerians live below the poverty line and survive on less than a dollar a day , according to the cia world factbook . nigeria is under economic pressure because of falling crude oil prices worldwide and a weakened currency . corruption has been a hindrance to building a stable economy despite years of democracy , analysts say . there are 14 candidates on the ballot , but the race is more of a rematch between the current president and a former military ruler . the two faced off in the last election in 2011 . president goodluck jonathan : . jonathan rode a wave of popularity in 2011 . at the time , he portrayed himself as a man of the people . during campaigns , he talked about growing up without shoes , a message that resonated with average nigerians . but in recent years , his popularity has plummeted , with nigerians saying he has not delivered on his promises for change . key officials have defected from his ruling people 's democratic party to the newly formed all progressives congress . muhammadu buhari : . the retired general has unsuccessfully run for election three times . buhari ruled nigeria in the 1980s following a military coup and was known for his tough regime , which some say was marked by human rights abuses . but he has pledged to make fighting graft and insecurity a priority if he wins , which might appeal to those who 've run out of patience with the current government . his military rule background could be a plus or a minus . `` many nigerians will not forget he was a military leader , during a dictatorship , '' johnson says . `` or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism . '' the election was originally scheduled for february 14 , but was delayed for six weeks . in addition to the presidential elections , nigerians will elect governors in 36 states . like their u.s. counterparts , the nation 's governors have a lot of clout . not only do they set priorities for federal funds , they are also responsible for security in their states and are thus the first line of defense against extremists , especially in the north , where militants have free rein . in populated cities such as lagos , governors manage economies larger than those of some african countries . to avoid a runoff , a candidate must get more than 50 % of the vote and at least a quarter in two-thirds of the states . if no candidate wins , a runoff election will be held seven days later . cnn 's christian purefoy contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a bill that would allow utah to use firing squads to execute some death-row prisoners passed in the state senate on tuesday . the measure , which passed 18 to 10 , will be sent to gov. gary herbert , who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill . herbert released a statement on the legislation , which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection . `` our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which -lrb- an execution -rrb- will happen . we have no intent to change that , '' he said . the law would give the state the option to use a five-member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection are n't available 30 days before the date set for the execution . `` our state , as is the case with states around the country , is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection . we are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that , when required , we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection , '' the governor said . eight people are on utah 's death row . utah banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death . the last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in utah . a utah firing squad also executed gary gilmore in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the u.s. supreme court reinstated the death penalty the prior year . in recent years , states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions . texas nearly out of execution drug . the european manufacturers of pentobarbital , an anesthetic , explicitly banned u.s. prisons from using its drug in executions . some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail . in april , oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry . clayton lockett , a convicted rapist and murderer , writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered . it took 43 minutes for him to die . last week , georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared `` cloudy . '' the state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures , officials said . georgia halts executions to analyze lethal drug cocktail . cnn 's tony marco contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- robert downey jr. may be iron man in the popular marvel superhero films , but he recently dealt in some advanced bionic technology himself . downey recently presented a robotic arm to young alex pring , a central florida boy who is missing his right arm from just above his elbow . the arm was made by limbitless solutions , a volunteer group started by albert manero , a university of central florida engineering phd student , to make free bionic arms for kids . through 3-d printing technology , alex and others have had the chance to get a robotic arm so they can use their limbs again . alex received his robotic arm in the summer , then later had it upgraded to resemble a `` transformers '' arm . this past saturday , alex received an even more impressive gift , from `` tony stark '' himself . downey met with alex in an atlanta hotel room . the actor showed the child two arms , one from downey 's movies and one for alex : a real , working robotic iron man arm . as they both tried theirs on , they compared the lights inside their palms . the video was posted thursday by downey as well as microsoft , which arranged the meeting as part of its social media campaign , the collective project , celebrating students using technology to change the world . it very quickly went viral on social media . alex is 7 , in first grade and a huge superhero fan . his mom told him they were going to atlanta to meet manero and a specialist who were working on a new arm for the boy . `` he did n't question it much , so we kind of just went with it , '' his mom , alyson pring , told cnn . `` afterward , i asked , ` why were you so quiet ? ' he said , ' i was freaking out ! ' '' after giving him the new arm , downey invited alex to hang out with him in atlanta this summer when he 's filming the new captain america movie . manero met alex through e-nable , a volunteer network that matches people who have 3-d printers with children who need limbs . alex 's mom wanted to get him a replacement hand because he was being teased . `` whenever people saw him , they 'd say , ` what 's wrong with your arm ? ' '' alyson pring said . `` now it 's , ` your arm is amazing , you 're so cool ... it helps educate people to maybe think twice before saying something like , ` why are you like that ' ? '' the prop master for the marvel movies built the case for downey jr. 's arm and the case for the little boy 's arm . the college students made the actual arm for pring , from the design to the painting to the robotics , said david beauparlant , marketing manager at microsoft . `` you could n't even do this stuff not too long ago . it 's amazing what the 3-d printing can do , '' he said . to find out more about alex and the collective project , here 's our recent story on the topic of 3-d printed limbs .

new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- do not generalize india as a country of rapists . that was the firm message from the german ambassador in new delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male indian student 's application for an internship due to the south asian nation 's `` rape problem . '' professor annette beck-sickinger never did such a thing , according to her and the university of leipzig . the university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from india ; while it was n't clear how many of them were men , the university said 29 of its 44 indian students total are male . still , beck-sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in indian society and how the issue spurred `` many -lrb- other -rrb- female professors in germany -lrb- have -rrb- decided to no longer accept male indian students for these reasons . '' `` it was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about indian society , '' she said , according to a statement posted on the website of the university of leipzig . `` i do not have anything against indian students -- on the contrary . i sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings i may have hurt . '' marital rape : why is it legal in india ? the firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site quora . it featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the university of leipzig 's biochemistry department . they fell under this provocative headline : `` what should an indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of india being projected as an unsafe country for women ? '' the post did n't identify beck-sickinger , blacking out the name of the emails ' author . but it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her : `` unfortunately i do n't accept any indian male students for internships . we hear a lot about the rape problem in india which i can not support . i have many female students in the group , so i think this attitude is something i can not support . '' the thing is , beck-sickinger says she `` never wrote '' such a message , claiming this email was `` put together from individual segments taken from different mails . '' `` i do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender , '' she added . `` i am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way . '' here 's what the university of leipzig says did happen : the professor told the candidate `` the laboratories are fully occupied . '' the indian applicant `` did n't accept '' this rejection , the university says , and went back-and-forth with beck-sickinger over email . during that exchange , beck-sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate . speaking about how indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country , she said , `` i fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals . however it is also unbelievable that the indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now . '' india bans rape documentary . beck-sickinger referred to regular reports of `` multi-rape crimes '' and abuse of female tourists that , `` for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards -lrb- women -rrb- . '' such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male indians `` and currently other european female associations are joining . '' `` of course we can not change or influence the indian society , '' she added , `` but only take our consequences here in europe . '' the idea that the professor would n't accept male indians for internships -- as reported by quora and denied by the university of leipzig -- riled up some in india , a number of whom wrote on the quora thread . one user , identified as sas vijay , said , `` do n't leave this issue . it is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds . file a complaint . '' another user , posting as hemanth sriteja , wrote , `` i do n't wan na come to an era where i should say ` hii -lrb- sic -rrb- , i 'm from india , i 'm not a rapist . '' one person echoing that view publicly is michael steiner , germany 's ambassador to india . `` your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in india ; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding , tolerant , open-minded and hard-working indians , '' steiner wrote monday in a letter posted on the embassy website . `` let 's be clear : india is not a country of rapists . '' the ambassador urged beck-sickinger `` to learn more about the diverse , dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of india so that you could correct a simplistic image , which -- in my opinion -- is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- angelina jolie took the stage saturday at nickelodeon 's 28th annual kids ' choice awards and delivered a message of hope to anyone who 's ever felt out of place . in her first public appearance since revealing that she underwent a second preventive surgery to lower her risk of cancer , jolie attended the show with her children , shiloh and zahara . she hugged them before she went to the stage to accept the favorite villain award for her role as maleficent in the live-action reimagining of `` sleeping beauty . '' `` when i was little , like maleficent , i was told that i was different . and i felt out of place -- too loud , too full of fire , never good at sitting still , never good at fitting in , '' the 39-year-old actor and humanitarian said . `` and , then one day i realized something , something that i hope you all realize : different is good , '' she said , prompting enthusiastic screams from the young crowd . `` and , as your villain , i would also say cause a little trouble -- it 's good for you . '' jolie 's career has been full of unconventional twists and turns , from her breakthrough role in the biopic `` gia '' to her current role as an actor , filmmaker and special envoy of the u.n. 's high commissioner for refugees . her personal life also has made front page headlines over the years , including her adoption of children from developing countries and her candor in discussing her health . jolie , 39 , wrote tuesday in a new york times essay that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer . two years ago , she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons . jolie 's mother died of ovarian cancer , and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population . jolie 's revelation provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media . `` it is not easy to make these decisions . but it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue . you can seek advice , learn about the options and make choices that are right for you . knowledge is power , '' she wrote .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 'm candida moss , and i am professor of new testament and early christianity at the university of notre dame . i was an adviser on the `` true cross '' episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in cnn 's `` finding jesus '' series , which airs on sundays . viewers were invited during the show to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page . below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them . they have been edited for style and clarity for this article . what 's `` true '' about the cross that killed jesus ? lynn santos : where might there be other pieces of the `` true cross '' ? is anyone attempting to carbon date these relics ? moss : there are churches all over the world that claim to have fragments or splinters of the true cross . these are n't being carbon dated and there are a few reasons why . first , carbon dating is expensive , and your average church does n't have the funds for this kind of endeavor . second , carbon dating is seen as intrusive and a little destructive . even if only about 10 milligrams of wood are needed , you 're still chipping away at a holy object . this is n't something that churches like to do , especially as -- and this leads me to my third point -- almost all carbon dating tests end up discrediting the relics that are being tested . so , it 's not in the best interest of the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches that claim to possess relics to have them tested . matt marino : are you able to tell what type of wood the cross was built from ? moss : unless we know with complete certainty that we have a fragment of the true cross , then we wo n't be able to assert what kind of wood was used . nonetheless , we can make some best guesses . a number of scholars have thought that the cross was made of cedar because cedar is a sturdy wood found in the region . there is also evidence from the crucifixion of other criminals . in 1968 , the remains of a crucified man named yehohanan ben hagkol were found during excavations in northern jerusalem . we know he was crucified because there was a spike embedded in his ankle bone . the department of botany at the hebrew university in jerusalem concluded that the wood underneath the nail was olive wood . so perhaps that 's a possibility . daniel pronych : how can we be certain the romans did n't reuse jesus ' cross ? moss : this is a great question . hewn wood and nails were more valuable in the ancient world than they are today . there are examples of the romans discarding tools and other implements -lrb- for instance after the battle of masada , when they left behind pottery vessels rather than haul them away -rrb- , but this usually took place in situations where carrying these tools was more effort than it was worth . the romans were efficient and would likely have reused the instruments of torture if they could . the jewish historian josephus tells us that wood was scarce around jerusalem in the first century a.d. and that the romans had to travel 10 miles to secure timber for the siege of jerusalem -lrb- jewish war 5.522-23 -rrb- . josephus was writing about a period of war some 40 years later but , all the same , we can imagine that the romans wanted to conserve the wood that they had . in other words , you 're absolutely right : we ca n't be sure the cross upon which jesus was crucified was n't reused in the execution of other criminals or in some other kind of construction . how well do you know the life of jesus ? take the quiz . james faubel : if the crucifixion of christ was so important to christians , why are there no images of christ on the cross in christian art until about the seventh century a.d. ? prior to that time , the depictions are usually of a lamb on the cross . moss : it is certainly true that early on -lrb- first-third century -rrb- christians did not use the image of the cross in their art . this in part seems to have been because crucifixion was so shameful and humiliating . depicting a cross would be akin to using an image of an electric chair or a hangman 's noose . so , early on , christians used images of daniel in the lion 's den , jonah and the whale and the three young men in the fiery furnace in the funeral art as symbols of resurrection and conquest of death . beginning in the fourth century , things began to change . constantine 's vision was really instrumental in this process . the cross began to be retrieved as a symbol of power , so that instead of being a symbol of shameful death it became an emblem of victory over death . there are a lot of really interesting studies of the emergence of the cross in early christian art ; i 'd recommend robin jensen 's `` understanding early christian art '' as a great place to start .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the final days of the israeli election campaign , prime minister benjamin netanyahu disavowed the two-state solution and said there would be no palestinian state on his watch . he also earned universal condemnation for his panicked warning to his followers on election day that arabs were `` voting in droves '' -- a comment that will resound to his shame and can neither be forgiven nor forgotten unless he apologizes clearly , sincerely and without reservation . and now , facing international uproar and a stern u.s. response , israeli officials have started backing away from these statements . the israeli ambassador to canada , rafael barak , said wednesday on cbc tv , `` this is an election campaign and you have to take with a grain of salt what was said at the last minute when the polls say you are going to lose . '' netanyahu himself , in an interview on nbc , tried to qualify his words about a two-state solution , saying what he meant to say was that a palestinian state was not viable under present conditions . he knows that stance is totally unacceptable to israel 's chief ally , the united states , and to the rest of the international community . and he should not be allowed to slip off the hook so easily . indeed , far from taking this statement with a grain of salt , the world is likely to look back at his previously stated support for a two-state solution and take that with more than a grain of salt . the fact is , rhetorical if not actual support for a two-state solution has served netanyahu well for the past several years , and has provided him with a convenient shield against international pressure to end the almost 48-year occupation of the west bank and gaza . also helping netanyahu was the presence in his cabinet of israeli politicians who actually do believe in a two-state solution and worked hard to make it happen -- notably former foreign minister tzipi livni , who headed up the failed 2014 negotiations with the palestinians . livni wanted to move forward in the talks , but found herself hemmed in and frustrated by netanyahu 's aides -- and apparently by the prime minister himself -- at every turn . now , as he constructs a coalition of ultranationalists and ultra-orthodox , those shields have been stripped away . netanyahu must now face the world having bared his true face and exposed his true beliefs -- and the international community , led by the united states , must respond accordingly . what should this involve ? to begin with , washington should not wait for others to draft a u.n. resolution condemning the settlements . it should take the initiative , in consultation with its international partners , in drafting a resolution that lays out the detailed parameters for an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . the resolution should of course state unequivocally that the solution rests in an israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines , with equivalent land swaps to incorporate some of the major settlement blocs within israel . it should also reiterate israel 's right to security . and it should state clearly and unambiguously that the settlements are illegal under international law and must stop . words are important -- but more important are deeds . whatever he says about the two-state solution , the next netanyahu government is virtually certain to blast ahead with settlement-building . it is on that basis that he and his administration should be diplomatically isolated and condemned . in his campaign statement , netanyahu took pride in approving the construction of a huge suburb on the southern fringes of jerusalem in order to block palestinian construction from neighboring bethlehem . he boasted that the building was not simply to provide housing for jews rather than palestinians , but that it was to make it harder for the palestinians to establish a coherent , territorially contiguous state . netanyahu 's statement was a moment of truth for him , for israel and for the world . he was admirably blunt and concise . he left no doubt what he intended . now , the world must hold him to account .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the 1950s it was cancer . hush , hush , whisper , whisper . `` they called it the ` c ' word , and it did n't get talked about in doctor 's offices , '' said beth kallmyer of the alzheimer 's association . `` it certainly was n't talked about in the general public , it was whispered . '' today it 's alzheimer 's , and 55 % of patients and their caregivers say their doctors never told them they have the devastating disease , according to a special report of the alzheimer 's association released this week . compare that to one of the big four cancers -- breast , colorectal , lung and prostate -- more than 90 % said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis . `` alzheimer 's not being talked about , many doctors are not giving the diagnosis , '' added kallmyer in a webcast . `` we need to change that . it 's a disease , it 's nothing to be ashamed about . '' `` this is very current , very well done , and pretty dramatic findings , let 's be honest , '' said dr. pierre tariot , director of banner 's alzheimer 's institute . `` i am reminded of the rather sobering fact that as many as 60 % of people who have a dementia die without the dementia having been diagnosed by their doctor . '' why the silence ? this is not the first report to show doctors are sidestepping this tough conversation . but why ? that 's been studied too , and the reasons doctors give range from diagnostic uncertainty and fear of causing emotional distress to time constraints , lack of support , and stigma . `` there is an element of stigma here towards brain and mental health problems in general , '' said tariot . `` i would call it professional awkwardness . i ca n't really help this condition , why invest time and energy talking about it , it makes me squirm . '' `` i think the comparison of alzheimer 's to cancer is appropriate , '' said dr. tom price , medical director for emory university 's geriatric clinic . `` i give patients a new diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease many times a week , and every time it is uncomfortable , and i 've been doing it for over 10 years . it is easier to talk about cancer now that there are so many new and effective treatment strategies , and cause of optimism with survival from cancer at an all-time high . '' what 's at stake . alzheimer 's advocates stress the importance of giving a patient all the facts , as early as possible , so they can work with their family to organize legal and health directives and have time to fulfill life-long desires . it 's just as important for the caregiver . `` imagine it 's your spouse , '' said tariot . `` personality changes , memory is different , language and communication is different , you do n't know what is going on . then you start getting answers , and you get a sense of how to play to his strengths and minimize his weaknesses . here are travel tips , communication tips , and safety issues ; here are ways to stay happy and joyful , even though this is a new chronic illness . '' there 's another critical factor as well : access to clinical trials that might help slow the illness . `` right now , the big studies that are underway in prevention are really looking at people in the early stages of alzheimer 's , '' said kallmyer . `` so by waiting , they can lose out on clinical trials as well . '' addressing the ` gap ' `` we want to be clear that we believe physicians are well meaning , but there 's a gap there somewhere , '' said keith fargo , director of scientific programs for the alzheimer 's association . `` we saw doctors say lack of time , lack of resources , so we think the answer to this mostly has to do with education and providing more resources . '' experts cnn spoke to agreed . `` as a field , we have failed , '' tariot told cnn . `` it is n't just the doctors in the trenches . medical schools , professional organizations and health care systems have not recognized the importance of identification and management of people with dementia .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- i am atheist -- and i am black . yes , we exist -- even if many in the media sometimes do n't notice us . in a cnn special that aired on tuesday , for example , people of color were not as well-represented as american atheism 's more familiar face : you know , white males . in fact , african-american atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of american atheists at large . does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just do n't gravitate towards nonbelief , or are there other factors which keep us hidden ? there is a harsh truth to face here . most blacks identify as religious . belief in god is touted with pride , and the church is intricately tied to tradition , history and culture . it is not uncommon to assume that i attend services as a black woman . the question often is n't if i go to church -- it 's where . and even if one does n't go to church , surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god . all of this makes the words `` black '' and `` atheist '' hard for many to imagine in the same sentence . it can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community . many have social , emotional and financial stakes invested in this institution , so for one to even say they have doubts is like committing treason . to openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible , and good luck finding other blacks who also do n't believe . it is very important to note however , that the internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other , and there is a large community of us online . though i was raised secular -- a rarity in my community -- i 've had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist . however , my journey is far from tragic . in founding my organization , black nonbelievers , in 2011 , i have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself , or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind . and they have done so bravely , defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion . the friendly atheists next door . my experience in the secular community as a black atheist has ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated , and even ignored . on the one hand , there is common ground shared -- our nonbelief and even discontent with religion unites us . on the other hand , there is a notion that since we share this common ground that there are no other issues to address . the lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing , but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care . we are sometimes treated as if we are invisible , or even as an afterthought -- which does not make the few persons of color feel welcome . fortunately , all is not lost . progress has been made . there are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color , women and children . there is a more concentrated focus on support for the lgbt demographic , as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds . there are support systems for people who have lost loved ones , yet they have no religious affiliation . moreover , there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent . such representation is now reflected at organized events , in leadership , as well as in media coverage . while the number of visible minority atheists is still small , we are here and we 're here to stay . we will continue to grow , in both the black and secular communities . we can lead the charge for this change . the more we make our presence known , the better our chances of working together to turn around the disparities we face , and bolster the recognition we so rightly deserve . we are not alone .

'' jenkins , 25 , and hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on june 26 , 2013 . her sister shaneah was dating lloyd , 27 , who was shot six times , according to prosecutors . at one point , mccauley asked jenkins if she ever saw guns in the home . she told the jury that she saw one `` in the kitchen junk drawer . '' prosecution witnesses have testified that lloyd was shot to death with a .45 - caliber glock handgun . mccauley approached jenkins on the stand with a glock similar to the one used in the murder . `` is that a secured firearm ? '' she asked , moving back slightly . `` yes . '' mccauley asked if the glock 's shape was similar to the one she saw in the junk drawer . `` yes , '' she responded . `` color ? '' `` yes .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- update : jonathan hyla said in an phone interview monday that his interview with cate blanchett was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the web last week . `` she was n't upset , '' he told cnn . `` when you watch the entire interview in the full context , you can see she instigates a lot of the ridiculousness that ensues in the interview . '' blanchett ended the interview laughing , hyla said , and `` she was in on the joke . '' this article has been updated and includes the unedited interview . if you 're going to interview cate blanchett , please have some good questions prepared . blanchett was talking to jonathan hyla of the australian tv show `` the project '' in conjunction with `` cinderella , '' but hyla 's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes . hyla thought he 'd begin the interview on a casual note , saying blanchett would be a good person to have a beer with . blanchett was having none of it . `` this date is not going well ; i do not drink beer , '' she responded . after some more back-and-forth , with an apparently sometimes testy , sometimes punchy blanchett trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film , hyla finally tried another angle . `` how were you able to get that cat to do what you wanted -lrb- it -rrb- to do on a leash ? '' he asked about a cat blanchett 's nasty stepmother has in the film . `` i tried to put my girlfriend 's cat on a leash , and it just never works for me .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- he 's a virtual unknown to american audiences , but james corden proved he had what it takes as a late night host . corden 's debut as the fourth host of cbs ' `` late late show '' on monday night was one of the smoothest first episodes of any new talk show hosts in recent memory . ignoring the usual five minutes or so of monologue jokes , corden launched right into a star-studded pre-taped bit that showed how he got the job of host : by picking up one of cbs president les moonves ' willy wonka-esque golden ticket dropped by chelsea handler -lrb- a joke referencing rumors that she was in talks for the job corden won -rrb- . corden received advice from jay leno , arnold schwarzenegger and meryl streep as he trained to be the best host he could be . in a nod to one of his influences , graham norton , corden brought out his two guests , mila kunis and tom hanks simultaneously . in the midst of their conversation , kunis , who was sporting a ring , seemed to confirm -lrb- with a `` maybe '' -rrb- that she had just married ashton kutcher , though that still has n't been confirmed and it may be that corden , hanks and kunis are pulling our leg . the highlight of the show , however , was corden and hanks ' rapid fire rundown of his movie career , which has to be seen to be believed . corden 's predecessor , craig ferguson , sang the new show 's theme song , and corden - who co-starred in the musical film `` into the woods '' - ended his first show with an original song . if twitter reaction is any indication , corden charmed enough viewers to draw viewers back tuesday night .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- every year , animal handlers travel throughout england and wales to compete at agricultural shows . jooney woodward 's `` best in show '' is a documentation of those competitions , with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals . `` when you go to -lrb- the shows -rrb- , they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals , '' woodward said . `` i just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they 're so committed to what they do . they 're really devoted and hardworking . '' while those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers , woodward 's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style . `` my work is a bit more composed . i use a medium-format camera and a tripod , so it is a bit more static in a way , '' she said . `` i think everybody is so proud of their animals that when i said to them that , ` i 'd love a portrait of you and your cow , ' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they 're so passionate about what they do . '' the `` best in show '' portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals . woodward 's photos also contain subtle details . for example , the symbols and signs on the wall behind wendy and her hereford yearling heifer mandalay juliette are just as significant as the handler and her animal . `` it 's just the way -lrb- wendy -rrb- had gone through the effort of decorating the pen -lrb- with union jacks -rrb- where the cows were being kept , '' woodward said . `` there 's also a sign behind -lrb- her -rrb- ... and there 's a picture of a gentleman with a cow , who is actually her husband who had died a few years ago . ... i just thought that was nice , something quite sentimental about that . '' there are not only sentimental subtleties within `` best in show , '' but also fun and interesting ones as well . this is especially evident in the photo of the traditional welsh pigs being judged , as woodward points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs . regardless of what elements make up woodward 's photos , the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important . woodward said that when photographing jamie and his jersey cow , his happiness and smile made her want to `` share that sense of enjoyment '' that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows . what drew woodward to harriet and her guinea pig gentleman jack were the similar colors radiating from both of them . her photo of the pair won the national portrait gallery 's taylor wessing photographic portrait prize in 2011 . '' -lrb- harriet -rrb- was like a steward , she was sort of judging the guinea pigs . and she also had her own guinea pig with her , which had red as well , '' woodward said . `` i just thought that was incredibly striking . i thought , ` i 've got to get a shot of that . ' '' the dynamics of the competitions foster a community atmosphere in which everybody becomes acquainted with one another after having traveled to different shows for so many years . woodward said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because `` you get to see lots of familiar faces . '' social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . she has learned about the pride the handlers have toward their animals , and many of her presumptions about the competitions have now changed after having worked on `` best in show . '' `` i think when i first started going , i was sort of thinking the shows would be more novelty , fun things for these people , '' she said . `` but , actually , it is n't really ; it 's quite a serious thing , because they can make money from breeding . '' in addition to handlers earning significant money from breeding , they are also able to achieve recognition for their livestock . those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete , because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings . the competitions are also rather family-oriented , and woodward said that while adults compete , their sons , daughters and grandchildren are involved as well . the younger generations are likely to one day take over the responsibility of running the family farms , and everyone that participates seems to have a strong sense of pride and passion for agriculture . `` i think it 's something i will always document for the rest of my life , and see how things change , '' woodward said . `` it was challenging , insightful and fun .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- europe is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that threatens to unravel decades of european integration and derail the world 's recovery from the great recession . to understand this crisis , let 's compare two countries . country a is a small nation with a long history of tax evasion , government debt defaults and a dysfunctional business and regulatory climate . it allows workers to retire in their 50s , and pays double pensions when they do . it lied about its budget to get into the eurozone . country b is a large , historically powerful nation with a record of low government debt . country b even ran budget surpluses , including a 2 % surplus just before the financial crisis hit in 2008 . it entered the eurozone with an honest accounting of its finances . if you guessed that country a is greece , you are correct . if you believe greece has caused the crisis in europe because of its fiscal irresponsibility , then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter . but what do we make of fiscally responsible country b ? its virtuousness must mean it is weathering the crisis . and it must be germany , right ? wrong . country b is not germany . country b is spain . far from prospering , spain is doing terribly . spain 's unemployment rate is 23.7 % , down from a high of almost 27 % in 2013 . more than a fifth of its workers have been jobless for the last four years . more than half of its young people are out of work and have been for years . there is regularly talk of a lost generation in spain and greece . like greece , spain 's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout -lrb- although a much smaller one -rrb- to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing . spain 's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to gdp ratio has shot up dramatically . if greece and spain have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence , what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in ? the answer is not fiscal virtue . something else is going on . that something else , in large part , is the euro . joining the eurozone meant spain and greece gave up the power to create money , the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness , and the power to set interest rates . these are not trivial concessions , especially in a currency union like the euro where transfers between rich and poor sectors of the economy are limited , strict budget rules deny individual countries the flexibility to react to a crisis , and trade between euro-area nations is severely imbalanced . the inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s , spain and greece could n't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies . the over-heating was largely caused , by the way , by the frenzied -lrb- and ultimately reckless -rrb- lending in both countries by german and other core european banks . the european central bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in germany and france that proved too low for spain and greece -lrb- and ireland -rrb- . read : 25 people to blame for the financial crisis . the over-heating of the greek and spanish economies led to inflation and investment bubbles . as those bubbles burst , the banks neared collapse , and their rescue led ultimately to a sovereign debt crisis . the inability of spain and greece to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in europe or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the eu . strict budget rules of eurozone membership also required spain and greece to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the great depression . they were required to raise taxes and cut spending even as unemployment reached astronomical levels . austerity helped create a depression of historic magnitude in greece and a severe recession in spain . the policies also created runaway public debt . greece 's debt is now 175 % of gdp . spain 's debt to gdp ratio is 100 % -- a level not seen in spain in more than 100 years . because spain and greece can not devalue the euro , the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation . this means greece and spain are in for years of high unemployment , reduced living standards , falling wages and deflation . in other words , massive impoverization . mario draghi , head of the european central bank , famously said : `` the euro is forever . '' that may or may not be so , but it does n't mean that countries like greece and spain should stay in the euro forever . contrary to popular opinion , this crisis can not be explained away with a moral tale of greek fiscal irresponsibility . the facts suggest otherwise .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- utah 's governor signed a bill monday that brings back firing squads as a potential way to execute some death row prisoners . lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state , gov. gary r. herbert said in a statement . a firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs can not be obtained . `` those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state , '' said marty carpenter , a spokesman for herbert . `` we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued . however , when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant , enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch , '' he said . utah banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death . the last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in utah . a utah firing squad also executed gary gilmore in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the u.s. supreme court reinstated the death penalty the prior year . cnn 's tony marco contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year ago , when dr. stephane hugonnet was dispatched to guinea to investigate a series of unexplained deaths , he had little idea that he 'd be contending with an outbreak that would quickly spread from a small southern rainforest village , across borders , and around the world . the ebola outbreak , ravaging primarily guinea , liberia and sierra leone , is a year old today . according to one official count , it 's infected 24,000 people and killed 10,000 . and it 's managed to do so because of an institutional failure on several levels : weak public health systems locally and a painfully slow response globally . but in order to get to where we are , we need to go back to how it began . it takes a village . before the virus ravaged west africa , before the deaths soared into the thousands , before the outbreak triggered global fears , ebola struck a toddler named emile ouamouno . the 2-year-old boy is who researchers with the new england journal of medicine believe was the first person to contract the disease in december 2013 . emile lived in a rainforest village in southern guinea . how he got infected , no one is sure , but ebola can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue . one thing that is certain , within a month ebola not only took emile 's life , but also those of his mother , sister and grandmother . from there , it spread like wildfire , passing to neighboring villages and beyond when people attended the grandmother 's funeral . where they went , the virus followed . by the time dr. hugonnet landed in guinea , he did n't yet know that it was already too late . hugonnet leads the global capacities , alert and responses team of the world health organization , and was one of the first doctors on the ground . `` we were following this rumor of a small cluster of unexplained deaths in guinea , '' he said in a first-hand account of the early days of the crisis . `` when the lab results came back , we learned that there was ebola zaire in west africa . this was a first . '' hugonnet was working with a team of logisticians , a medical anthropologist , laboratory technicians , virologists and infection prevention and control specialists . it was an impressive collection of professionals with the goal of rapidly assessing the situation and getting it under control , keep it localized . but this outbreak was different , hugonnet said . `` person-to-person transmission had quickly spread from a rural area to a large urban city , '' making it harder to contain , he said . `` and , the outbreak was becoming multi-national ; cases were confirmed in liberia and were suspected in sierra leone . '' from those early days , the outbreak would mushroom . in july , patrick sawyer became the first american citizen to die at a hospital in monrovia , liberia . his case raised fears the virus could spread beyond the countries at the heart of the outbreak . and it does . international flights took the disease as far as spain and the united states . on august 6 , a businessman with ebola died in a hospital in saudi arabia . he had been to sierra leone for work . five days later , a spanish catholic brother died in madrid . and on september 20 , . the spanish catholic brother with ebola , brother miguel pajares , dies in madrid . september 20 , a liberian named thomas duncan arrived in dallas to visit relatives . he had been unknowingly exposed to the ebola virus -- and he became the first known case of ebola diagnosed in the u.s. . he died a few days later . meanwhile , the disease took an ugly toll in west africa . by september , it had orphaned about 3,700 children in guinea , liberia and sierra leone . scared relatives did n't want to take them in , and officials worried the number of kids without parents would rise higher -- much higher . `` ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence , '' said manuel fontaine , unicef 's regional director . `` we can not respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways . we need more courage , more creativity , and far , far more resources . '' why did n't we ? in a scathing new report , published monday , doctors without borders puts the blame squarely on a `` global coalition of inaction '' that waited months to respond to the epidemic . `` the ebola epidemic proved to be an exceptional event that exposed the reality of how inefficient and slow health and aid systems are to respond to emergencies , '' said said dr joanne liu , the organization 's international president in the report , `` pushed to the limit and beyond . '' for example , by march 21 , 2014 , 78 victims had died , mostly in guinea . the world health organization said at the time that while the ebola outbreak is serious , it is `` relatively small , still . '' `` for the ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail , '' said christopher stokes , the director general for doctors without borders . `` and they did , with tragic and avoidable consequences . '' local hospitals were overwhelmed . international response was weak . by october , when sierra leone was reporting a rate of five infections an hour , unicef said it had received only 25 % of the $ 200 million it needed for emergency assistance for families affected by ebola in the region . a significant challenge remains ahead , doctors without borders says . `` to declare an end to the outbreak , every single person in contact with someone infected with ebola must be identified . there is no room for mistakes or complacency ; the number of cases weekly is still higher than in any previous outbreak , and overall cases have not significantly declined since late january . '' it 's sobering news a year into the outbreak . although the headlines have faded a bit from public view , the threat has not . cnn 's holly yan contributed to this report .

'' lately , the perfect television family has changed . in a recent commercial , a boy begrudgingly shares a toy with his younger sister , then they all gather together with a large brood to watch the televised lunar new year gala . the message appears to be : two is better than one . the change is extraordinary . since the early 1980s , the party has enforced a draconian one-child policy on most chinese to curb population growth . when the propaganda did n't work , local officials have resorted to abortions , heavy fines , and forced sterilization . it 's perhaps the most hated policy in china . now , under relaxed restrictions announced just over a year ago , couples like yang xue and chang zi'an , both professionals working in beijing , are eligible for a second child to join their baby girl -- 11-month-old tao zi , or little peach . chang was an only child but sometimes wished for a sibling while growing up . `` once my cousin visited and we shared a bed for several nights , '' says chang , now an engineer . `` i enjoyed that feeling . i wished i had a brother who could share a bed with me every night . '' chang and his young family live in tongzhou , on the eastern outskirts of beijing , where high rise apartments compete with mega malls . some call the area `` tong-afornia , '' because its sprawl of young professionals is a bit like parts of the golden state . they are ideal candidates , it would seem , to have a second child . the party is in a race against the clock . china faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce . the government says the country could become home to the most elderly population on the planet in just 15 years , with more than 400 million over the age of 60 . researchers say healthcare and social services will all be burdened by the greying population , and the world 's second largest economy will struggle to maintain its growth . `` china has already begun to feel an unfolding crisis in terms of its population change , '' says wang feng , a professor at fudan university and a leading demographic expert on china . `` history will look back to see the one-child policy as one of the most glaring policy mistakes that china has made in its modern history . '' perhaps surprisingly , wang says that the one-child policy was both ineffective and unnecessary , since china 's fertility rates were already slowing by the 1980s . the chinese government still maintains that it was necessary to keep numbers down . but with around 150 million one-child families and a shrinking population , the chinese government is moving cautiously , rather than doing away with the policy altogether . in january 2014 , china said it would allow couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves . but , to the surprise of many , the new rules have n't yet sparked a baby boom . nationwide , nearly one million couples have applied to have a second child , state media reported in january . health officials had said that the policy would lead to as many as two million new births when the policy change was first announced . yang and chang both have good jobs , but rent in tongzhou is sky-high . and they want to send little tao zi to a private bilingual english and chinese pre-school to help her in the ultra-competitive chinese education system . even if they were richer , they say they would n't want a second child . `` money is only part of the problem , '' says yang . `` your energy and your time is also important . we both have to work . it is hard enough to raise her as a success . it will be miserable if we had to go through that again . '' as for his cousin 's sleepovers , chang wants to clarify . `` it was great having him over , but i was also happy when he went home . '' cnn 's shen lu contributed to this report .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- there 's been plenty of talk lately about how dangerous stereotypes can be when it comes to the empowerment of our girls and young women . for instance , the #likeagirl campaign , which took a hammer to the notion that doing anything `` like a girl '' should be viewed as an insult , has become an international sensation . less discussed , though , is the reality that our boys face damaging stereotypes too . that was the motivation behind a recent workshop held by sheknows media , a leading women 's lifestyle media company . a group of new york city tween boys ranging in age from 8 to 10 got together as part of the company 's hatch program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation . the boys were shown dozens of advertisements perpetuating hypermasculine stereotypes , such as images of men all muscled up and not wearing shirts . in one ad for a big truck , the boys heard the tag line `` can a truck change how people feel about a guy ? '' is the ` be a man ' stereotype hurting boys ? another advertisement , this one for a clothing company , showed a man from the waist down along with the caption `` wear the pants . '' `` that 's a man wearing the pants so that shows that men are in charge , '' said one of the boys , who 's 9 . what was clear was that this group of boys knew what the advertisers were trying to get them to think , but they were n't exactly buying it . `` i play with girl toys and boy toys . i do n't really care which one is meant for boys or for girls . i just play with them . they 're toys , '' said another boy , also 9 . `` man up '' might mean toughen up and be unemotional , said another boy , who added that his image of what a man should be is completely different . `` if i were to describe the perfect man , the words would be smart , not judgy , and kind , '' said the 10-year-old . ` dad ' gets a makeover in super bowl ads . these boys certainly ca n't speak for all tween boys , but their comments reflect what appears to be growing attention surrounding the use of gender stereotypes for boys as well as girls . seventy-six percent of men who took part in a recent online survey by sheknows media admitted using phrases like `` man up '' and `` be a man '' toward boys . of the more than 1200 men and women surveyed from across the country , 73 % said boys are most often described as `` aggressive , '' 69 % said `` strong '' and 53 % said `` athletic . '' when the men were asked about stereotypes during their teen years , 72 % said they became aware of physical attractiveness and 50 % said they grew more conscious about weight . kids as young as 5 concerned about body image . the awareness starts even earlier , according to a recent analysis of existing research on kids and body image by common sense media , a child advocacy group . it found that over a third of boys ages 6 to 8 think their ideal weight should be thinner than their current body weight . `` these are problems that are often thought of as problems for girls , but boys are just as impacted and they 're exposed to unrealistic body images , '' said ellen pack , vice president of marketing for common sense media , which is partnering with sheknows media to help parents understand the impact that media and technology are having on children . `` the proportion of undressed males in advertising has been steadily on the rise since the 1980s , '' said pack . `` the same kinds of inappropriate messages that we 're giving to our girls , we 're giving to our boys too -- that they do n't measure up , that they 're not adequate . '' at the same time , there does appear to be more open-mindedness on what being masculine means to men and boys today , based on the poll 's findings . of the men surveyed by sheknows , 78 % said it was ok for boys to cry , 65 % thought it was fine for boys to wear pink , and 55 % of men said boys should be able to play dress-up . `` you should be able to do your own things and do what you want , '' said one of the boys , who is 8 . sheryl sandberg teams up with the nba to get men to lean in . the takeaway for parents is that they , more than anyone or anything else , influence the stereotypes their boys will encounter and what impact those stereotypes will ultimately have on them . `` we found the single most significant driver of their perception of what 's ok for boys was their parents , '' said samantha skey , chief marketing officer for sheknows media . `` it was n't pop culture or adam levine or usher . it was their parents , '' she said . `` if their parents think they 're strong and appropriately masculine , then they are . period . '' pack , of common sense media , says parents should be talking about the issue to their boys when they are young , even as young as 5 , and should call out stereotypes when they see them . `` do n't just turn your eyes . use it as an opportunity to engage in a conversation with your kids and challenge assumptions , '' pack said . `` when you are seeing things on tv that you think are unrealistic , point it out . '' i , for one , wish we could wipe out `` be a man '' and `` man up '' from all of our vocabularies . but , actually , why do we need to remove the language ? we just need to change what it means . the tweens involved in the hatch workshop offer some real-life evidence that that may be already happening . `` when you go your own way , it feels good because you feel free and you can do what you want to do , and you do n't have to do what other people say , '' one of the boys said . what do you think is the best way to empower boys and young men to tune out negative gender stereotypes ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter @kellywallacetv or cnn living on facebook .
islamabad , pakistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- pakistani armed forces paramilitary personal stormed the headquarters of one of the country 's most powerful regional opposition political parties in a predawn raid on wednesday , seizing a stash of weapons and arresting several wanted criminals , officials said . the rangers arrived unannounced early wednesday morning , arrested five men and sealed off the party 's headquarter for four hours . according to a press release from the mqm -lrb- muttahida qaumi movement -rrb- one of their party workers was shot fatally by rangers during the raid . `` all telephone lines have been disconnected and premises ransacked . computers and other electronic items have been confiscated . the rangers also destroyed the electronic surveillance system that had been set up following the may 2013 bomb attacks by the pakistan taliban -lrb- ttp -rrb- , '' the release said . rangers officials have not responded so far to these accusations . in a statement to the media , the pakistan rangers released a list of those arrested , including faisal mota , a former mqm worker who had been convicted and sentenced to death in absentia for the murder of journalist wali khan babur . speaking to the media , rangers spokesperson col.tahir mahmood also confirmed that a large amount of illegal weapons had been seized during the raid . `` the weapons that we had were legal and there as a precautionary measure to deal with real threats from the taliban against our party and its workers , '' faisal sabzwari , a senior mqm party leader told cnn . mqm is based in karachi and is one of pakistan 's largest political parties . it has the second-largest contingent in the provincial assembly , with 54 of 130 seats . it styles itself as a voice for the downtrodden , the middle class and immigrants from nearby india , but political rivals accuse the party of using heavy-handed tactics , including intimidation , to stay in power . `` the raid is meant to send a clear message that law enforcement agencies and rangers in particular are not going to bow to any political convention , '' said zarrar khuhro , a senior journalist and political analyst in karachi . mqm 's party leader altaf hussain , who has been living in self-imposed exile in london called for calm , but criticized the raid saying that `` it should not be the role of the armed forces to conduct extrajudicial operations on lawful organizations , least of all the headquarters of a democratically elected political party . '' pakistan 's interior minister chaudhry nisar ali khan said late wednesday night that the raid was legal . the mqm has the clout to shut down the city in an hour , sparking general strikes which could last for days , locals say . in the aftermath , locals say businesses in karachi have shut down , and gas pumps and schools are closed for fear violent protests could erupt in the streets .
-lrb- cnn -rrb- texas sen. ted cruz will announce monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 republican nominee for president . cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012 . his announcement takes place at a bastion of conservatism , liberty university , the institution founded by evangelical leader jerry falwell . cruz is going to run from the right . he has spent much of his short career in washington blasting the `` mushy middle '' of his party -lrb- which might be news to most democrats -rrb- , which he dismisses as a `` failed electoral strategy . '' during a recent visit to new hampshire , where he vowed to eliminate the department of education and the internal revenue service , cruz said that `` i 'm pretty sure , here in new hampshire , y' all define gun control like we do in texas : gun control is when you hit at what you aim at . '' fifty years ago , another republican senator ran this kind of campaign , arizona 's barry goldwater , who took on president lyndon johnson . cruz will test the conventional wisdom that goldwater 's strategy was and remains a failure . when republicans voted to nominate him in 1964 , goldwater told the delegates that `` extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . and moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue . '' when the icon of moderate republicans , new york gov. nelson rockefeller , spoke to the convention , the delegates hissed and booed . the outcome was far from great for the gop . johnson defeated goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal democratic majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred . although goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964 , cruz thinks that the times have changed . is he right ? right now , the chances are not great . if cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism , he faces very long odds of making it to the white house . the strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against jeb bush in red states , but it is not an approach with a great track record . even as the republican party has shifted to the right in recent decades , republican candidates who have obtained the nomination , and those who have also won the presidency , always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes . ronald reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent , and george h.w. bush had a thousand points of light . his son george w. bush emphasized policies tied to `` compassionate conservatism '' to prove that he was not an extreme zealot . even republicans who did n't win in the general elections , like john mccain and mitt romney , did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base . notwithstanding the conventional wisdom , even in primaries it seems that republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in november . this coming election will be tough for republicans . as all the experts have shown , the electoral college math does not favor the gop . some experts have predicted that democrats have over an 80 % chance of winning the electoral college . according to the washington post , if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election , five currently favor democrats -lrb- florida , iowa , minnesota , ohio and pennsylvania -rrb- while in others , like colorado , democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends , namely growing minority populations that favor their party 's nominee . barring any dramatic changes in the coming months , democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in hillary clinton . cruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate . the republican party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in washington . in 2014 , congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14 % . as the new year began , the approval ratings were only slightly better : just 16 % . this is the congressional republicanism where cruz comes from . many voters who like conservatism and the gop do n't love what their representatives are doing on capitol hill . the kind of scorched earth , always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings . there have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as cruz . during his campaign for the presidency , he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in congress . when goldwater squared off against johnson in 1964 , the president predicted that there would be a `` frontlash '' of republican and independent voters who would move way from the gop just because goldwater was at the top of the ticket . this was johnson 's response to predictions of a backlash in the south from democrats who were angry about civil rights . the frontlash , johnson explained to bill moyers is `` liberals , independents , moderate republicans . '' the electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in midwestern states in 1964 , where solidly republican areas went democratic because they were scared off by goldwater , but a cruz campaign could be exactly what democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain . monday , cruz will bask in the spotlight of his announcement . but republicans are going to have to really think hard about whether they want to put all of their electoral eggs in this volatile basket which , at least based on the history , has a very slim chance of winning .
-lrb- the hollywood reporter -rrb- sam simon , the nine-time emmy award-winning comedy writer and producer who helped develop `` the simpsons , '' made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity , has died , his foundation announced on facebook . he was 59 . simon was diagnosed in february 2013 with terminal colon cancer . yet through it all , he tried to remain upbeat and keep his sense of humor . `` the museum of broadcasting called and said , ` we were thinking about doing an archive interview with you . do you mind if we did it now ? ' '' simon said with a laugh on marc maron 's wtf podcast that first ran in may 2013 . during his brief career , the influential simon also served as the showrunner on the sitcom `` taxi '' at the age of 23 ; wrote for and produced the comedies `` cheers '' and `` the drew carey show '' ; and created a fox series for the legendary stand-up comic george carlin in the mid-1990s . simon also wrote the 1991 film `` the super , '' a 20th century fox comedy starring joe pesci as a new york slumlord . most recently , simon was a consultant on the charlie sheen series `` anger management '' and hosted a show on radioio.com . he showed up frequently on howard stern 's siriusxm show and in march 2013 thanked the acerbic host for being `` the perfect friend . '' story : terminally ill ` simpsons ' co-creator vows to give away fortune . a cartoonist and stanford graduate , simon developed `` the simpsons '' with matt groening -lrb- who came up with the characters based on his family -rrb- and producer james l. brooks . all three had worked on `` the tracey ullman show , '' where bart simpson and his family got their start as animated sketches shown before and after commercials . `` the simpsons , '' centering on tv 's `` first fully self-aware dysfunctional family , '' as simon put it , debuted on fox on december 17 , 1989 , and is now the longest-running primetime series in american history . ken levine , an emmy winner who has written for `` the simpsons '' and other sitcoms , described simon 's contribution to the show during a 2009 interview published in stanford magazine . `` sam brought a level of honesty to the characters , '' levine said . `` is it too bizarre to say he made cartoon characters three-dimensional ? his comedy is all about character , not just a string of gags . in ` the simpsons , ' the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles . ` what are they thinking ? ' -- that is sam 's contribution . the stories come from the characters . '' simon also is credited with assembling the show 's elite writing team that included al jean , george meyer , john swartzwelder , mike reiss , jon vitti and conan o'brien . story : james l. brooks on ` simpsons ' journey . `` i remember sam coming into the room , and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated , '' o'brien told vanity fair in 2007 . `` he 's hilarious . it was fun to try and make him laugh . i remember that about sam . if i could make sam laugh , i was excited . '' tired of the grind , simon exited the show in 1993 after four seasons but worked out a deal tied to home video sales that he said paid him `` tens of millions '' every year . the agreement also guaranteed him executive producer credit long after he departed , and his name appears in the credits of every episode . a couple of years after he left , simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business . he was in his mid-30s . as detailed in the hollywood reporter 's 2013 philantrophy issue , simon 's charitable contributions include founding the malibu-based sam simon foundation -lrb- worth nearly $ 23 million as of 2011 -rrb- that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs . his other pet charities include peta , which in february thanked him for his support by naming its norfolk , virginia , headquarters the sam simon center ; international nonprofit save the children ; and the sea shepherd conservation society , a global marine conservation organization . his generosity led the latter in 2012 to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels -- used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing -- the m/y simon . simon also turned a malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf . `` the sort of lifetime achievement stuff that i 'm getting now is kind of like tom sawyer 's funeral because they all know i 'm sick , '' simon told thr 's gary baum . `` i am getting buildings named after me and awards and stuff . the truth is , i have more money than i 'm interested in spending . everyone in my family is taken care of . and i enjoy this . '' in may 2014 , it was revealed that simon spent $ 60,000 to rescue an abused thoroughbred . simon , who won eight of his emmys for writing/producing `` the simpsons '' -lrb- many after he left -rrb- and one for producing `` the tracey ullman show , '' was married to and divorced from actress jennifer tilly -lrb- 1984 to 1991 -rrb- and playboy playmate jami ferrell -lrb- for mere weeks in 2000 -rrb- . neither marriage produced any children . born june 6 , 1955 , simon grew up in beverly hills in an era when the neighborhood was `` quaint , '' as he put it . groucho marx lived across the street , and he recalled walking into his parents ' room as a youngster and finding the legendary comic and his mom sitting on the bed . -lrb- he stressed they were n't about to have sex . -rrb- another time , elvis presley returned the dog that simon had lost . while at stanford , simon drew cartoons for the local newspapers in san francisco and the school paper and landed a job at filmation studios doing storyboards for `` the new adventures of mickey mouse '' and `` heckle & jeckle . '' simon scored his first tv writing gig on the animated `` fat albert and the cosby kids '' in 1979 . he mailed in a script to `` taxi '' -lrb- co-created by brooks -rrb- that was accepted , and that led to a staff writing position and then the job as showrunner . simon also went on to direct episodes of the carlin show , `` the drew carey show , '' `` friends , '' `` norm '' and `` anger management . '' an avid poker player , simon re-created his home game in a penthouse at the palms hotel in las vegas for a playboy tv show in 2009 . the show also featured tilly -- a very good player -- as well as comedians dave attell , norm macdonald , jeffrey ross and artie lange . another one of simon 's more eclectic pursuits was working the corner at amateur fights and serving as president of sweet science inc. , which managed boxer lamon brewster . his fighter stunningly knocked out wladimir klitschko to win a share of the heavyweight championship in 2004 . during his chat with maron , simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to `` list the three things he loves to do . when he ca n't do those any longer , it 's time . `` one of my three things is laying in bed and watching tv . so by that criteria , i will never be euthanized . '' later , talking about all the millions he 's given to charity , he added : `` i kinda like it when people talk about me as a special person . but i know i would be a nut if i did n't have a lot of money .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- a previously unknown species of catfish has been named for the wide-eyed , puckered-mouth `` star wars '' character it resembles . its scientific name is peckoltia greedoi , and it is known for its large , dark eyes , puckered lips and protruding bristles . but you can call him greedo , in honor of the bounty hunter from `` star wars episode iv : a new hope . '' you might remember him from the cantina scene on mos eisley , where he was killed by han solo while attempting to collect on a debt for jabba the hutt . `` i think it was the whole package that evoked greedo , but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth , '' said jonathan armbruster , biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the auburn university museum of natural history . armbruster made the connection in september with colleagues david werneke , milton tan and chris hamilton . but , like many things in academia , it took a while to make it official . the specimens were found in 1998 by researchers along the gurupi river in brazil . armbruster obtained them in 2005 from a museum in porto alegre for a manuscript he was preparing on the genus , `` thinking they were unusual . '' he designated them as another existing species , peckoltia vittata , in a 2008 paper , `` although i had not been comfortable with that designation . '' he examined them again in september and discovered they were different from peckoltia vittata . after talking it over with his colleagues , they realized he was a clear ringer for greedo . `` as a 7-year-old kid , i watched `` star wars '' in the theater , and it was a life-changing experience for me , '' said armbruster . `` i became a lifelong fan , and i now share that with my son . greedo has always been a personal favorite of mine . '' greedo became the object of controversy when lucasfilm re-released the original star wars trilogy in 1997 . a reworked scene showed greedo firing a shot at solo before solo fired back . in the 1977 release , han is the only one to fire , prompting backlash from fans and giving rise to the phrase `` han shot first . ''
-lrb- cnn -rrb- boko haram , the nigeria-based islamist terror group , has pledged allegiance to isis , according to an audio message purported to be from boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau . in the audio , which was posted online saturday , the speaker says boko haram is announcing its `` allegiance to the caliph of the muslims , ibrahim ibn awad ibn ibrahim al-husseini al-qurashi , '' which is another name for isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . cnn has not been able to independently authenticate the message . but jacob zenn , an expert on the terror group and is with the jamestown foundation , said the recording appeared to be authentic . he said that while other messages have been faked , the speaker in this one is shekau . `` boko haram joining the isis fold makes sense to both groups , '' he said from abuja , nigeria . `` boko haram will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands into -lrb- french-speaking -rrb- west africa . it will also get guidance from isis in media warfare and propaganda . previously boko haram was a sort of outcast in the global jihadi community . now it is perhaps isis 's biggest affiliate . `` isis gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate . '' zenn said the allegiance will be official when an isis leader such as spokesman abu mohammed al adnani issues a statement . boko haram has had two main factions -- one led by shekau and the other comprising former members of ansaru , a boko haram offshoot . ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the nigerian wing of aqim -lrb- al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -rrb- . after the french-led intervention in mali in 2013 , a significant number of ansaru members re-integrated with shekau , zenn told cnn . the prerequisite for boko haram joining isis coalition was a coming together of two factions . isis connected with former ansaru fighters within boko haram and pressed them to further unify the group 's ranks . the result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions . that involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al qaeda-like ansaru and the ultra extreme `` takfiri '' - like shekau . the pledge follows a period during which shekau 's faction had been mimicking isis , including praising al-baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos . zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from isis , apart from a few references to nigerian jihadis in recent issues of the english-language dabiq magazine . it appears that a month ago isis set up a twitter account on which saturday 's message was linked , zenn said . the twitter handle was mutually promoted by boko haram and isis . in july , shekau voiced support for isis , and declared a overtaken town in northeast nigeria to be part of an islamic caliphate . but he also said he was praying for al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri and taliban leader mullah omar . u.s. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along . the cia 's analysis has been that boko haram is very african and rooted in that region 's islamic practices , even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of islam . and isis 's arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks , not unlike the society they come from . isis leaders view shekau as inferior , partly for racist reasons , the cia indicated at a briefing for reporters . boko haram , whose name translates as `` western education is sin , '' has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of sharia law . boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques . much of this violence has taken place in nigeria . but neighboring countries , such as cameroon and chad , have also been hit increasingly hard . cnn 's steve almasy and evan perez contributed to this story .
london -lrb- cnn -rrb- the handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip : makeup , bras , underwear , boots , an epilator . but this list was apparently made by the three uk schoolgirls suspected of traveling from london to syria to join isis , according to britain 's guardian newspaper , which has seen the document . the girls ' families told british lawmakers tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning , and said they were baffled by the teenagers ' decision to leave their homes and families . the three east london classmates -- shamima begum , 15 ; kadiza sultana , 16 ; and amira abase , 15 -- boarded a turkish airlines plane from london 's gatwick airport to istanbul on february 17 . they are thought to have crossed the turkish border into syria within days . relatives also had harsh words for police , who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to syria in december . amira abase 's father , hussen abase , told lawmakers at a hearing of the home affairs select committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized . sahima begum , the older sister of shamima begum , said her sister had been into `` normal teenage things , '' like watching `` keeping up with the kardashians , '' reading and playing games on her phone . there was nothing to indicate she was radicalized , she said . fahmida aziz , first cousin of kadiza sultana , said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization , `` we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying '' that thinking . she also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip . committee chairman keith vaz said it was `` every parent 's nightmare that this should happen '' and said he could only imagine the families ' distress and anguish . who are the missing uk girls ? the families ' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a february 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents , rather than being sent directly to the parents . the families claim they were not told about a 15-year-old friend of the girls going to syria weeks earlier -- and say that had they known , they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too . metropolitan police chief bernard hogan-howe apologized for his officers ' failure to get the letter directly to the parents , in his testimony before the committee . but he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left , with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit . hogan-howe said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened . assistant commissioner mark rowley told the committee there was a `` steady flow '' of girls trying to travel to syria , perhaps one or two a month . he said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to turkey at a local travel agency , using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families . none of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for istanbul . however , the families ' lawyer asked how they had managed , as minors , to board the flight without being challenged . cctv footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of istanbul -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether uk police had communicated effectively with turkish authorities . rowley said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing , who has not been named . asked how the uk might be able to get the girls back , rowley cited an incentive : as long as they 're not connected to terrorist offenses , they 'll be able to return to their families . rowley said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism-related activities , and if that remained the case , they would n't be treated as terrorists upon their return . who has been recruited to isis from the west ? the list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing . it detailed items to buy , such as underwear , a mobile phone and cosmetics , and estimated travel costs , apparently totaling # 2,190 -lrb- $ 3,296 -rrb- . the biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to turkey , the newspaper said , at just over # 1,000 . the list , written on a page from a diary planner , had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for . it 's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs . over the weekend , the girls ' families asked for an apology from london 's metropolitan police over the force 's handling of the case . the police said in a statement saturday that after the first girl went missing in december , a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at bethnal green academy -- including shamima , kadiza , and amira -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl . a deputy principal at the girls ' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls , on the advice of police , and told them that the girls ' friend , referred to only as `` girl 1 , '' had been reported missing . an officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on february 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters , the police statement said . but not all the letters were passed on . `` with the benefit of hindsight , we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents , '' the police statement said . `` however , the parents were already aware from the deputy head that girl 1 had been reported missing , all the teenagers were all being co-operative , they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to syria . '' what is isis ' appeal for young people ? days before they left for turkey , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , aqsa mahmood , who left her home in scotland to travel to syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media . she has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to syria to marry jihadis , as she did . her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter , which recommends that those traveling to syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much , since they may need to move often and at short notice , while remaining inconspicuous . missing teens seen on video in turkey before going to syria .
selma , alabama -lrb- cnn -rrb- crowds massed at a bridge in selma , alabama , sunday to remember and reflect upon the sacrifices of another crowd that gathered at the same bridge half a century ago on a day that came to be known as `` bloody sunday . '' walkers marched across the edmund pettus bridge in the afternoon to commemorate those freedom-marchers who were clubbed and tear-gassed by state troopers as they peacefully filed across on march 7 , 1965 . the crowd was massive . it was shoulder to shoulder near the bridge and several blocks away . there were so many people that walking is a bit misleading -- people just really moved inch by inch along the way . the protest decades ago against the denial of civil rights to americans based solely on the color of their skin , and the television coverage of the bludgeoning dealt them , hastened the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 . on sunday at selma 's brown chapel ame , a historically black church , leaders in the religious and political realm as well as community organizers gathered to hear speeches , sing hymns and remember what happened 50 years ago . u.s. attorney general eric holder was in the audience . rev. jesse jackson spoke , as did rev. al sharpton . an important figure in the decades-long fight for civil rights , former atlanta mayor and u.n. ambassador andrew young remembered the struggle in the 1960s but wanted everyone to keep pushing forward and thinking about achieving economic equality today . `` we 've got to focus on ourselves not as problems but as visionaries , '' he said . `` we have come a long , long way , but i have enjoyed every bit of it , '' young remarked . several people remarked at how much it meant that the day before , on saturday , america 's first african-american president , barack obama , made a rousing speech on racial progress in a diverse country . he said that the struggle against discrimination continues today . looking back , the `` bloody sunday '' march was triggered when a law officer shot a black man dead the month before . but it was about more -- the right to vote for all americans . about 600 people were going to march 50 miles to the state capital in montgomery before they were forcibly stopped . sunday 's festivities started with a breakfast and end late with a dance . a string of parades , receptions , reflections , films and discussions will fill the time in between . the commemoration marking 50 years since `` bloody sunday '' continues on monday . `` our march is not yet finished . but we are getting closer , '' obama said saturday , his words echoing into a crowd of thousands lined up in front of him . obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights . `` if selma taught us anything , it 's that our work is never done , '' the president said near edmund pettus bridge . read president obama 's prepared remarks . the president said that what civil rights marchers did years ago `` will reverberate through the ages . not because the change they won was preordained ; not because their victory was complete ; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible ; that love and hope can conquer hate . '' he hailed the marchers as heroes . the president said that `` the americans who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing , but they gave courage to millions . they held no elected office . but they led a nation . '' the president called on congress to restore the voting rights act , first passed in 1965 . in 2013 , the u.s. supreme court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to `` pre-clear '' any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them . efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in congress . 50 years later : memories from ` bloody sunday ' nurse . many of the nation 's leaders , activists and celebrities were in selma on saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event . on saturday , rep. john lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of congress from both parties joined the president at the bridge in selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of pettus , a confederate general who was also a ku klux klan leader . `` we must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work . there 's still work to be done , '' said lewis , adding this is an opportunity to `` redeem the soul of america . '' john lewis 's memories of the march . reflecting a sense of change in the half century since `` bloody sunday , '' and with selma again in a national media spotlight , the mood in the crowd saturday was of unity , and talks were focused on how to move america forward . but some current selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82 % black and with more than 40 % of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance . geraldine martin , 59 , has lived in selma all her life . she was 9 years old on `` bloody sunday '' and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister , belinda , to the world on that day . the two sisters grew up in selma less than a decade apart . opinion : selma 's historic bridge deserves a better name . belinda left selma after high school and now lives in atlanta . her view of selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside . `` i do n't see how selma will move forward without togetherness , '' said belinda . `` there is no diversity in selma . people do n't live together .

tunis -lrb- cnn -rrb- tunisian president beji caid essebsi confirmed that a third person took part in last week 's bardo museum terror attack in an interview sunday with french tv station itele . `` there were for certain three terrorists , '' essebsi said . `` there is one on the run . he will not get far . '' previously two suspects had been identified -- yassine labidi and saber khachnaou -- though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces . he said yassine was `` known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , '' but not known or being followed for anything special . authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to essebsi . the development came a day after the bodies of four italian tourists slain in the attack arrived back in italy , an official with the tunis crisis center told cnn , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue . most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated . nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis . french , spanish , italian , british , japanese , russian and colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far . the bodies of the italians were met in rome by italian prime minister matteo renzi , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony . eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in tunisia on saturday , the official at the tunis crisis center said . an uncle of yassine labidi , abeld malik labidi , told cnn on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew . but he said yassine labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum . `` it 's true that yassine carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , '' he said . but , he said , he believed yassine and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like syria and libya to train as fighters . he had known his nephew well , he said . `` after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young tunisian . he was n't extreme in any way . '' the only thing that raised questions was that yassine had disappeared for about a month , he said . although his nephew said he 'd gone to the tunisian city of sfax to work , his family now suspected he had been in libya because of the phone numbers he called from . `` when he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious . nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors i spoke to , '' said abeld malik labidi . `` he said hello to everyone , he prayed , he took his coffee , even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work . '' abeld malik labidi said yassine 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack . officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said . a cousin of yassine , who asked not to be named , told cnn that the family was shocked by what had happened . `` we are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may god forgive him . those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm australians or japanese ... our islam does n't mention about killing people , islam has never been this , '' he said . he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was `` a normal tunisian guy ... but not an extremist . '' security minister rafik chelly said on friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in libya . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , he said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . `` they left the country illegally last december for libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster alhiwar ettounsi tv . like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring . but unlike its neighbor to the west , libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by islamist militants . in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and apostates '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators . cnn 's claudia rebaza reported from tunis and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's radina gigova and greg botelho contributed to this report .
